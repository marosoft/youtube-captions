---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're going to get started working on

---------00:02----------
yet another macbook

---------00:03----------
before we get started let's have our

---------00:05----------
announcements for the day firstly

---------00:08----------
we apologize for store.rosmangroup.com

---------00:10----------
not being functional for a while

---------00:12----------
store.rostmangroup.com is now back to

---------00:14----------
functioning

---------00:15----------
we have since fired the magento

---------00:17----------
developer that made the website not work

---------00:19----------
in firefox and several other browsers

---------00:21----------
you can add items to cart again

---------00:23----------
like gallons of amtec flux iso 9239s

---------00:26----------
cd3215s lt3470s lp 8550s

---------00:31----------
and at hot air stations that will come

---------00:34----------
with the bent nozzles

---------00:36----------
and we also have a lot of stuff that we

---------00:37----------
probably should be adding to the site

---------00:38----------
for the newer machines that we haven't

---------00:40----------
so let us know in the comments down

---------00:41----------
below the chips that we're missing

---------00:43----------
and the chips we should have secondly if

---------00:46----------
you are interested in a job

---------00:48----------
and you are knowledgeable enough that

---------00:51----------
you could be an entry-level board repair

---------00:52----------
technician meaning

---------00:53----------
you know how to solder you know what

---------00:55----------
pp3842 is

---------00:57----------
contact us at don't delay work here

---------00:59----------
today at rosman group dot com

---------01:00----------
that's don't delay work here today at

---------01:03----------
rosman group.com

---------01:04----------
also if you are a hard drive data

---------01:07----------
recovery technician we have positions

---------01:09----------
open for that as well

---------01:10----------
must be experienced feel free to email

---------01:12----------
if you don't have experience

---------01:14----------
i will probably delete the email just

---------01:15----------
being honest here so we don't waste

---------01:16----------
their time

---------01:17----------
that being said let's get on to the

---------01:19----------
video oh no

---------01:20----------
not this old piece of [ __ ] no this is

---------01:24----------
the erica macbook ew

---------01:28----------
820-3209

---------01:30----------
gross the pch isn't even integrated into

---------01:34----------
the processor

---------01:36----------
oh sound of a [ __ ] i'm getting a call

---------01:37----------
from one of those other spam numbers

---------01:45----------
please do not hang up we are calling

---------01:47----------
about this

---------01:48----------
oh suck my dick i get these calls like

---------01:52----------
five times a day now

---------01:55----------
so aggravating i like my moto g it works

---------01:58----------
very well

---------01:59----------
i like the job but i live in london

---------02:03----------
london is a really really long commute

---------02:05----------
unless you're willing to do a titanic

---------02:06----------
commute every day to work i don't know

---------02:08----------
how we're gonna make that work out

---------02:10----------
you can always try but something tells

---------02:11----------
me the commute's gonna let's get the

---------02:13----------
board out of the case and try to figure

---------02:14----------
out what's wrong with this

---------02:15----------
you know what really sucks when you get

---------02:16----------
to that point where you're large enough

---------02:18----------
a company that you actually need to have

---------02:19----------
like

---------02:20----------
write-ups in an hr department i think

---------02:22----------
i've gotten to the point where i

---------02:23----------
actually have to do write-ups

---------02:24----------
it sucks but like it it it really sucks

---------02:29----------
i remember saying when i was younger

---------02:31----------
once i get to a point where i have to

---------02:32----------
have write-ups at my company i'm

---------02:33----------
probably gonna quit

---------02:36----------
and now i'm there but it's like [ __ ]

---------02:37----------
what do you do i sense another pm sleep

---------02:40----------
s4l missing

---------02:48----------
a sideshow bob going on here

---------03:16----------
so

---------03:24----------
maybe it'll turn on now that i took it

---------03:25----------
out of the case hi

---------03:32----------
legorel how are you and thank you very

---------03:34----------
much

---------03:36----------
the issue is six milliamps to 19

---------03:38----------
milliamps we have a green light so we're

---------03:40----------
probably getting

---------03:41----------
vol if we are probably getting have a

---------03:42----------
working smc and pp3042

---------03:44----------
underscore g3 hot present let's go over

---------03:47----------
the board and see what we see

---------03:49----------
i'm expecting corrosion by the clock

---------03:51----------
chip uh short on peepee but that's you

---------03:53----------
know not a short on pp bus

---------03:55----------
maybe a blown fuse on ppbus g3 huh but

---------03:59----------
okay never mind here we go here we go

---------04:01----------
baby see those probe points

---------04:03----------
see those probe points they're corroded

---------04:07----------
look at that we have corrosion

---------04:09----------
everywhere

---------04:11----------
and what i would like to do

---------04:17----------
let me show you what i want to do

---------04:26----------
yes

---------04:48----------
this is actually messier than the exacto

---------04:50----------
knife in my opinion

---------05:05----------
very weirdly placed corrosion

---------05:12----------
aha there we go that's that's the head

---------05:15----------
shot right there

---------05:17----------
this is the chip that creates my 3.3 and

---------05:19----------
5 volt rails that you saw on the other

---------05:20----------
stream

---------05:22----------
that's the headshot thank you for

---------05:25----------
watching atrt7 sometimes i kind of

---------05:27----------
wonder if what i'm producing

---------05:29----------
actually helps or gets anybody to do

---------05:31----------
anything and uh

---------05:33----------
seeing stuff like that we're seeing tim

---------05:36----------
streams where he shows

---------05:38----------
how he's fixing stuff that gets

---------05:39----------
butchered by

---------05:41----------
much larger organizations really does

---------05:43----------
kind of make all the work that goes into

---------05:44----------
making this kind of stuff and editing it

---------05:46----------
and everything

---------05:47----------
seemed like it's worthwhile so thank you

---------05:49----------
very much for that i really genuinely do

---------05:50----------
appreciate it and it does

---------05:52----------
kind of encourage me to make sure i keep

---------05:54----------
on doing what i'm doing

---------05:56----------
so just again thank you very much

---------06:01----------
okay so what i'm going to do i'm going

---------06:03----------
to remove that junk

---------06:05----------
and i'm going to replace it i'll be

---------06:08----------
right back

---------06:09----------
right after this break from our sponsors

---------06:45----------
now as you can see down there there is a

---------06:48----------
missing pad now a lot of people have

---------06:49----------
asked why don't i use a fiberglass pen

---------06:51----------
to scrape stuff instead of a knife or

---------06:52----------
tweezers

---------06:53----------
well look at the size of the pad see the

---------06:56----------
size of the pad

---------06:58----------
see that okay now check out the size of

---------07:01----------
the fiberglass pen

---------07:04----------
yeah yeah so this is my little

---------07:07----------
exacto blade over here

---------07:10----------
see so

---------07:13----------
hopefully that answers that question i

---------07:16----------
have genuinely appreciated to the

---------07:17----------
individual that sent me these fiberglass

---------07:19----------
pens thank you very very much i really

---------07:21----------
do appreciate it

---------07:22----------
however if you see me using a knife

---------07:24----------
instead it's because the size

---------07:26----------
of it is much more convenient and allows

---------07:29----------
me to do

---------07:30----------
what it is that i'm doing

---------07:34----------
how's the quick been working for you

---------07:36----------
it's all right i would probably buy an

---------07:38----------
atom if i was gonna

---------07:39----------
you know go back in time and start

---------07:41----------
purchasing stuff

---------07:42----------
they're virtually indistinguishable

---------07:44----------
honestly it's just the atom is like

---------07:45----------
mildly cheaper

---------07:54----------
okay so that's that

---------07:58----------
i tried to fix my mini pc you couldn't

---------07:59----------
see any corrosion schematic

---------08:01----------
yep that sounds like your good

---------08:03----------
old-fashioned nightmare

---------08:05----------
all right wait for the alcohol to

---------08:06----------
evaporate add some

---------08:09----------
authentic amtec soldering flux that you

---------08:11----------
can now add to cart on

---------08:13----------
store.rosmangroup.com

---------08:18----------
store.rosmagroup.com is back up and

---------08:19----------
running my friends

---------08:21----------
tell me the trips that you want us to

---------08:24----------
stock

---------08:28----------
and i will make an effort to stock them

---------08:32----------
all right so we've rehabilitated that

---------08:34----------
pad kate

---------08:35----------
is doing some very high quality concern

---------08:38----------
trolling

---------08:43----------
do not take the bait my friends

---------08:48----------
do not take the bait of what's called a

---------08:50----------
concern troll

---------08:52----------
alright so this is in place long island

---------08:55----------
doesn't count

---------08:56----------
because there's no such thing as home

---------08:57----------
ownership there homeownership doesn't

---------08:59----------
exist

---------09:00----------
if you're paying 15 at 20 000 bucks a

---------09:02----------
year on top of the

---------09:04----------
of the 500 to a million you paid for

---------09:06----------
your house i mean you know you don't own

---------09:07----------
anything

---------09:08----------
long island you really like this there's

---------09:10----------
no ownership in that

---------09:12----------
there whatsoever i mean they've managed

---------09:15----------
to scam people into living someplace

---------09:17----------
where you buy a house

---------09:19----------
for five hundred thousand dollars and

---------09:21----------
then you pay 12 000 or more a year for

---------09:23----------
the privilege of keeping it check this

---------09:25----------
out

---------09:26----------
now it's working again it's not power

---------09:28----------
cycling so

---------09:32----------
first thing i'm going to do go to

---------09:34----------
flexboardview

---------09:36----------
and open up the boardview and schematic

---------09:39----------
for an eight two zero

---------09:43----------
eight two zero dash is 3209

---------09:47----------
and yes for the person that said taxes

---------09:48----------
go to schools and roads

---------09:50----------
so if long here's the thing are the

---------09:54----------
if the schools in long island cost 15 to

---------09:57----------
20

---------09:57----------
000 a year and there are other parts of

---------10:00----------
the country

---------10:01----------
where they manage to educate their

---------10:03----------
children with property taxes of two to

---------10:05----------
three thousand a year

---------10:07----------
are you getting a school that's five

---------10:09----------
times better in long island

---------10:11----------
or is that money just going somewhere

---------10:13----------
it's not supposed to

---------10:14----------
i tend to believe the latter i really

---------10:16----------
find it very difficult

---------10:18----------
to believe that the schools in long

---------10:21----------
island

---------10:22----------
are four to five times better than the

---------10:24----------
schools in delaware

---------10:25----------
maybe they are maybe they're buying

---------10:27----------
macbooks for every student or some

---------10:28----------
stupid [ __ ] like that

---------10:30----------
i became very cynical when it came to

---------10:32----------
property taxes earlier

---------10:34----------
i think it was around 2013 or 2014 there

---------10:36----------
was this entire school district

---------10:38----------
that started sending me macbooks and i

---------10:40----------
was wondering why the [ __ ] are you

---------10:42----------
getting people in k through 5

---------10:44----------
1 000 computers are you out of your

---------10:46----------
[ __ ] mind

---------10:49----------
who's paying for this oh wait you are if

---------10:52----------
you own a home in that neighborhood

---------10:54----------
you are paying for kids to have macbooks

---------10:56----------
[ __ ] that

---------10:58----------
no way in hell get the [ __ ] out of here

---------11:00----------
there's no way i'm not paying 15 to 20

---------11:03----------
000

---------11:03----------
a year so that kids can have ipads and

---------11:05----------
macbooks in every [ __ ] class

---------11:07----------
and kindergarten through fifth grade

---------11:09----------
when they're going to destroy them i'm

---------11:10----------
not saying you shouldn't have kids learn

---------11:12----------
how to be computer savvy

---------11:13----------
don't get don't get it twisted but the

---------11:15----------
whole idea behind macs

---------11:17----------
is that they just work the whole idea

---------11:19----------
behind a mac

---------11:20----------
is that forget about all that linux and

---------11:22----------
forget about all that windows [ __ ] we

---------11:24----------
have our own special magical way of

---------11:26----------
doing things

---------11:26----------
that makes it way easier than everybody

---------11:28----------
else's so you're going to teach kids how

---------11:30----------
to learn a non-standard system to some

---------11:32----------
extent

---------11:33----------
that is designed from the ground up to

---------11:36----------
be easy to people who are computer noobs

---------11:38----------
and charge the taxpayer more money

---------11:41----------
for their homes to afford it okay so our

---------11:43----------
corrosion was over here

---------11:45----------
r7245 what are you doing

---------11:48----------
so this sits between

---------11:53----------
our pp5vs3 creation circuit and the chip

---------11:56----------
responsible for creating it and the way

---------11:57----------
it's going to see what's on output over

---------11:59----------
there

---------12:00----------
is by having a 0 ohm resistor and a

---------12:02----------
capacitor

---------12:04----------
between here and the output

---------12:08----------
and the chip itself so that is what

---------12:11----------
this does and it's called the best

---------12:16----------
you may say i have no idea what all the

---------12:18----------
stuff is this is all very confusing

---------12:20----------
what is a buck converter how is a buck

---------12:22----------
converter controlled

---------12:23----------
why is there an rc circuit in between

---------12:25----------
the transistor and the chip

---------12:27----------
the great part is you don't really have

---------12:28----------
to know all that what you have to do

---------12:30----------
when you have a board like this

---------12:31----------
is you see the corrosion you fix the

---------12:34----------
corrosion

---------12:36----------
you ultrasonic the board and it works

---------12:38----------
again

---------12:39----------
so that is about that that's it for

---------12:42----------
today

---------12:43----------
i apologize for this very very poor

---------12:45----------
explanation of a buck converter

---------12:47----------
i have lost my enthusiasm to explain it

---------12:50----------
because i've explained it millions of

---------12:51----------
times

---------12:52----------
i think in older videos i used pictures

---------12:54----------
to show you how this works with a little

---------12:56----------
multi

---------12:56----------
i had a oscilloscope set up on the desk

---------12:59----------
and i actually took screenshots

---------13:00----------
at each phase of the buck converter

---------13:02----------
circuit so that i could explain it

---------13:04----------
in a manner where it made a little bit

---------13:06----------
more sense i've lost a little bit of

---------13:08----------
that natural enthusiasm because those

---------13:09----------
videos are like five or six years old

---------13:11----------
now

---------13:12----------
but hopefully this made sense to you

---------13:15----------
that's it for today

---------13:16----------
and as always i hope you learned

---------13:17----------
something i'll see you all in the next

---------13:18----------
video

---------13:20----------
bye now oh lastly before we go some tips

---------13:23----------
if you are ultrasonically cleaning

---------13:24----------
boards

---------13:25----------
and you have a problem where you wind up

---------13:26----------
killing some every now and then

---------13:28----------
or if you're new to ultrasonic cleaning

---------13:30----------
i do

---------13:31----------
have a guide that i will link to here on

---------13:34----------
my wiki on how to clean a motherboard it

---------13:36----------
could still use some work

---------13:37----------
for sure but it gives you some general

---------13:40----------
idea when it comes to macbooks like the

---------13:42----------
glossy versus the matte finish boards

---------13:43----------
because the glossy finished ones are

---------13:45----------
often easier to kill

---------13:46----------
how can you risk killing a board in an

---------13:48----------
ultrasonic cleaner how should you use it

---------13:50----------
properly so that you don't

---------13:51----------
wind up killing your board what often

---------13:54----------
kills the board in an ultrasonic cleaner

---------13:55----------
and so on and so forth this is just some

---------13:58----------
basic stuff from

---------13:59----------
years of experience dealing with

---------14:01----------
employees at [ __ ] up boards

---------14:03----------
and it may be useful to you if you are

---------14:06----------
ultrasonically cleaning boards or

---------14:08----------
just getting into liquid damage repair

---------14:10----------
and if you would like to contribute some

---------14:11----------
pictures that don't suck

---------14:13----------
by all means i would be happy to have

---------14:15----------
make that

---------14:16----------
uh take them remember that everything

---------14:18----------
that i post here

---------14:19----------
is going to be openly available to

---------14:21----------
anybody who wishes to view it

---------14:23----------
and uh yeah i'll see you all in the next

---------14:24----------
video
