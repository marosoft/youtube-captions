---------00:00----------
we were using 40 milliamps but not

---------00:02----------
turning on hmm

---------00:04----------
PP buzz g3 hot is 1.6 on the other side

---------00:07----------
also 1.6 perhaps it's short it to ground

---------00:10----------
wonder if we have a PP bus short we

---------00:12----------
don't have a PP bus short because we're

---------00:13----------
getting 7.30 9 million ohms to ground on

---------00:17----------
PP bus so let's take a look at the

---------00:18----------
circuit responsible for creating

---------00:21----------
creating PP bus d3 hot and oh my that

---------00:26----------
looks disgusting hmm but then we have

---------00:29----------
this over here what are you you're a

---------00:32----------
little resistor that just came off of

---------00:33----------
the board as soon as I tell so as you

---------00:35----------
can see over here P channel source is

---------00:38----------
going to be coming from the adapter now

---------00:40----------
when that goes over here Wonderbread

---------00:49----------
anyway sorry so this is gonna be 18

---------00:53----------
volts in the adapter now this resistor r

---------00:55----------
7185 takes the 18 volts that would be on

---------00:58----------
the source of the transistor and puts it

---------00:59----------
on the gate which means the voltage in

---------01:00----------
the source and the gate would be equal

---------01:02----------
which means it would never turn on

---------01:02----------
however our 71 86 would allow this to

---------01:05----------
become a voltage divider because that

---------01:07----------
goes between the gate and ground but it

---------01:09----------
doesn't go straight to ground as you can

---------01:10----------
see this goes to use 70 100 on charger s

---------01:14----------
gate which then would get to switch and

---------01:16----------
choose when you 70 100 is going to

---------01:18----------
ground so you seven thousand would

---------01:20----------
choose when this turns on however it can

---------01:21----------
choose if that resistor is broken and

---------01:23----------
the same is true for this side because

---------01:24----------
as you could see these two transistors

---------01:26----------
in here and the purpose of this is to

---------01:27----------
keep voltage from the battery from going

---------01:29----------
back into the charger and vice versa so

---------01:31----------
what we have to do is scrape get those

---------01:33----------
pads back and put their resistor there

---------01:35----------
so let's find a donor board and get that

---------01:38----------
resistor

---------01:51----------
that pad does not look like it's coming

---------01:53----------
back

---------01:56----------
[Music]

---------02:49----------
hmm

---------03:19----------
okay it looks a little softer now that

---------03:23----------
looks that looks pretty nice that looks

---------03:28----------
like something that we can work with now

---------03:29----------
doesn't it

---------03:35----------
nice soft Pat's

---------03:37----------
all right well we got to do is ten

---------03:41----------
though and we're just gonna slowly tin

---------03:43----------
those nice super soft pads with with my

---------03:51----------
tip just tease it a little bit there we

---------03:57----------
go

---------03:58----------
just a mild teasing don't just like that

---------04:03----------
mild teasing with the tip

---------04:10----------
it's starting to get liquid everywhere

---------04:12----------
here we want to try to find the nub

---------04:15----------
sometimes it can be really difficult to

---------04:17----------
find the spot of the nub that we need to

---------04:19----------
work on in order to get everything going

---------04:22----------
is going to be patient and find that

---------04:25----------
spot find that nub there we go let's get

---------04:31----------
our tip right in there now

---------04:38----------
[Music]

---------04:40----------
we're gonna spread it okay

---------04:57----------
[Music]

---------04:58----------
there we go just read it up

---------05:02----------
[Music]

---------05:09----------
[Music]

---------05:16----------
[Music]

---------05:26----------
[Music]

---------05:41----------
[Music]

---------05:52----------
you know I gonna blow that into place

---------06:00----------
let's just put our blower on it for a

---------06:02----------
moment

---------07:12----------
now that's a resistor

---------07:14----------
[Music]

---------07:19----------
all right to solidify its position there

---------07:34----------
[Music]

---------07:45----------
[Music]

---------07:55----------
Thank You Nick lab

fan spin

---------08:19----------
fans spin do you have a Macbook that

---------08:22----------
needs to be fixed come by our store

---------08:23----------
which is open to the public at 186 First

---------08:26----------
Avenue in Manhattan are you located

---------08:28----------
outside of New York no problem send us a

---------08:30----------
machine from anywhere in the world by

---------08:32----------
going to our website and clicking on the

---------08:34----------
mailbox or simply heading over to send

---------08:36----------
your macbook comm that send your macbook

---------08:39----------
comm will you be redirected to our mail

---------08:42----------
and instructions page that includes the

---------08:44----------
form and the directions on how to send

---------08:46----------
us a MacBook for repair we have a live

---------08:49----------
chat where you can speak with us about

---------08:51----------
the repair that you need a phone number

---------08:53----------
where a representative will pick up

---------08:54----------
during our open hours and a contact form
