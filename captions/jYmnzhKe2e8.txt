---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so here we

---------00:01----------
have an a 1398 15-inch MacBook Pro and

---------00:05----------
it's randomly kernel panic let's open

---------00:07----------
this thing up and see if it's one of the

---------00:09----------
models that's known for randomly kernel

---------00:10----------
panicking in an old video I was showing

---------00:12----------
you how the solder joints on the GPU

---------00:14----------
buck converter on this machine are

---------00:16----------
particularly terrible many people get it

---------00:17----------
wrong and they think that reflowing the

---------00:19----------
GPU fixes the problem not only are they

---------00:22----------
lowering the lifespan of their GPU by

---------00:24----------
reflowing it and putting it through that

---------00:26----------
heating cycle but they're not actually

---------00:28----------
fixing the problem long-term of the GPU

---------00:29----------
buck converter if that manages to fix

---------00:31----------
your problem it's only because you've

---------00:32----------
ancillary heated the GPU buck converter

---------00:35----------
underneath the board whose solder joints

---------00:36----------
of the actual problem when the board

---------00:38----------
flexes you can tell that Apple

---------00:40----------
understood that this is the problem in

---------00:41----------
their recall program because what they

---------00:42----------
will do is they will put what looks like

---------00:44----------
a little piece of shoe rubber right on

---------00:46----------
top of that chip just kind of smash it

---------00:48----------
onto the board because that's totally

---------00:50----------
gonna fix the problem let's open this

---------00:52----------
thing up and see if fits that model

---------00:53----------
machine that is known for that failure

---------00:55----------
let me turn off this fume extractor

---------00:56----------
because it's really loud

---------01:04----------
time to do this harder joints or [ __ ]

---------01:12----------
have a fur coat Apple not be a shame to

---------01:16----------
produce this damn

---------01:38----------
oreo sorrows better than this look at

---------01:42----------
that third one third one down over here

---------01:46----------
it's got a cut on it

---------03:03----------
the fourth one from the right on the

---------03:05----------
bottom oh man that's [ __ ] because you

---------03:12----------
have to keep in mind when I look at this

---------03:13----------
stop the exposure here is that that is

---------03:17----------
not water damaged this is not water

---------03:22----------
damaged

---------03:23----------
that's just Apple that's that's awful

---------03:27----------
look at that

---------03:29----------
it's like self corroding solder oh yeah

---------03:32----------
and then when people say that this is

---------03:34----------
all like it's planned obsolescence

---------03:35----------
there's certain things Apple does like

---------03:37----------
making sure that certain chips are not

---------03:39----------
replaceable and telling the manufacturer

---------03:41----------
not to sell them to anybody else like

---------03:44----------
with the is l9 to 4 zero where it's

---------03:46----------
obvious that it's intentional you're

---------03:48----------
you're purposely making it so that

---------03:50----------
people cannot buy a $5 to $15 chip

---------03:53----------
that's required to fix the 1,500 to

---------03:55----------
$30,000 products but when it comes to

---------03:57----------
[ __ ] like this this isn't plan that's

---------03:59----------
just a good old bad manufacturing in

---------04:01----------
stupidity it would be lovely to be able

---------04:03----------
to credit to Apple malice but this is

---------04:05----------
just [ __ ] design so let's make those

---------04:12----------
look nice it was nice self corroding

---------04:15----------
solder joints and again every time I do

---------04:19----------
this now figuring out problems like this

---------04:22----------
putting in the effort to figure out the

---------04:23----------
problems and then fix it and then no

---------04:26----------
we're charging people hundreds of

---------04:27----------
dollars every single time they come to

---------04:29----------
us one of these problems and every

---------04:31----------
single day keep saying the same thing

---------04:33----------
hey you may want to reconsider buying

---------04:35----------
this stuff now you may want to

---------04:37----------
reconsider buying this thing

---------04:44----------
and I'm dishonest

---------04:48----------
I get paid good money to do what I'm

---------04:53----------
doing right now see this this looks like

---------04:54----------
I'm filing my nails right it's look as

---------04:57----------
simple as filing my nails but this thing

---------04:59----------
that's seemingly so simple we get paid

---------05:01----------
good money here like I'm employing 13

---------05:04----------
people here about 12 they think since

---------05:06----------
one of them is putting time into school

---------05:08----------
right now offer doing this just filing

---------05:13----------
my nails see that look at the difference

---------05:16----------
in those joints and I'm willing to give

---------05:19----------
up all that money to say hey here's not

---------05:22----------
here's maybe you don't want to give him

---------05:25----------
this company anymore money here's why I

---------05:27----------
don't think you should give her the

---------05:28----------
money let me demonstrate to you on

---------05:30----------
camera why it is you should not give

---------05:32----------
this company more money and every day I

---------05:38----------
come to the youtube comment section see

---------05:42----------
100 200 300 comments you have no

---------05:44----------
integrity you made this up you are paid

---------05:50----------
to say bad things about Apple no one

---------05:53----------
paid to incentivize people to keep

---------05:56----------
buying the [ __ ] because there's good

---------05:58----------
money in doing this is so much good

---------06:00----------
money in doing this but yeah so look at

---------06:03----------
this joints on the right and look at the

---------06:04----------
ones on the bottom in the top so the

---------06:06----------
bottom and the top of the joints that I

---------06:07----------
did see bottom in the top of the joints

---------06:10----------
that I just did take a look at what they

---------06:13----------
look like and then take a look at what

---------06:15----------
the left and the right which is the

---------06:16----------
before so left and right or the before

---------06:18----------
joins top and bottom of the after joints

---------06:46----------
those are the old ones here you have the

---------06:49----------
new ones right now we're going to do the

---------06:51----------
other two sides

---------08:11----------
like filing my nails

---------08:36----------
it looks so pretty when it's all done

---------08:38----------
doesn't

---------08:45----------
now we're gonna see if we get GPU vcore

---------08:47----------
when hooked up to a screen now all I'm

---------08:49----------
interested in I just plugging in the

---------08:50----------
screen and the charger I just want to

---------08:52----------
see if I get GPU Veeck or if I get GPU

---------08:54----------
vcore I'm a happy boy let's see so let's

---------09:00----------
see what the multimeter gives me all

---------09:02----------
right so five volts on their screen

---------09:06----------
backlight is 46 volts I'm probably gonna

---------09:10----------
have an image on my screen cuz the GPU

---------09:11----------
in the screen and all that stuff is on

---------09:12----------
and we got a blinking question mark

---------09:15----------
folder so it looks like the issue with

---------09:16----------
this machine was that the GPU buck

---------09:19----------
converter had very bad solder joints and

---------09:22----------
this is a common issue in this machine

---------09:24----------
because there's no support to keep it

---------09:26----------
level they added that in the 2013 late

---------09:29----------
model and upward so that the board would

---------09:31----------
stay level in 2015 after many years of

---------09:34----------
people complaining Apple finally

---------09:35----------
recalled this along with some other

---------09:36----------
models and they were covered it for free

---------09:38----------
up until December of 2016 and that time

---------09:41----------
what they would do rather than resolder

---------09:44----------
the chip that's coming desolder from the

---------09:46----------
board is put a little piece of rubber

---------09:48----------
over it that would smash it into the

---------09:49----------
board because smashing a chip this

---------09:52----------
pushing it harder on that little

---------09:54----------
corroded solder joint is gonna make it

---------09:56----------
all better and obviously these things

---------09:58----------
would fail again because you're not

---------09:59----------
supposed to take a chip that's not

---------10:01----------
connected properly and just smash it

---------10:02----------
you're supposed to actually reset it

---------10:03----------
properly this is one of the areas where

---------10:06----------
I become somewhat frustrated when I read

---------10:09----------
the you know several hundred comments a

---------10:10----------
day I get saying you know this person's

---------10:12----------
making this up this person is purposely

---------10:14----------
saying this stuff because of an ulterior

---------10:15----------
motive I think that there is an IQ test

---------10:19----------
evident in some of these accusations

---------10:21----------
that is being failed which is that every

---------10:24----------
day every time I do this I take my

---------10:27----------
little iron and as easily as is filing

---------10:30----------
my nails I doe

---------10:31----------
zum-zum zum-zum those four songs each of

---------10:36----------
those four songs is worth about 70 to

---------10:40----------
100 dollars when it comes to this model

---------10:42----------
and what people have willing to pay to

---------10:43----------
fix it if I came on here and said in

---------10:46----------
yeah always 10 is great oh look at the

---------10:48----------
new features in the new Mac oh it's

---------10:49----------
those machines are amazing it's so

---------10:52----------
simplistic it's beautiful its elegant to

---------10:55----------
use Apple stuff is great I mean they're

---------10:56----------
innovative of course they're gonna screw

---------10:58----------
things

---------10:58----------
from time to time it's out of every

---------10:59----------
other company it would be in my best

---------11:01----------
economic interest simply brush these

---------11:02----------
things under the rug because there is so

---------11:06----------
much money to be made in such a short

---------11:08----------
time period from undoing these design

---------11:11----------
flaws and mistakes and the more people

---------11:13----------
decide to buy these the more people that

---------11:15----------
buy these the more machines there will

---------11:17----------
be or we could literally charge hundreds

---------11:19----------
of dollars to go zum-zum zum-zum but I

---------11:22----------
don't I try to give you what I believe

---------11:24----------
to be my honest opinion which is that

---------11:26----------
while there are lots of cheap ship

---------11:28----------
garbage out there there's also lots of

---------11:30----------
stuff out there that's affordable and

---------11:31----------
really well designed where they've

---------11:33----------
solved a lot of these issues over 15

---------11:34----------
years ago and that Apple is still having

---------11:36----------
to this day whether its inability to

---------11:38----------
type on a keyboard properly inability to

---------11:40----------
open it properly inability to produce

---------11:42----------
you know any just functional solder

---------11:45----------
joints this is just basic crap that

---------11:47----------
other companies failed at and solved a

---------11:49----------
long time ago I tell you the truth I

---------11:51----------
show you objectively why it failed and

---------11:53----------
then I give you my opinion in commentary

---------11:55----------
after showing you the failure into the

---------11:57----------
microscope and demonstrating what it is

---------11:59----------
they could have done differently so that

---------12:01----------
it doesn't fail and I hope that you hold

---------12:03----------
the company responsible so that and that

---------12:04----------
you stop giving them money and if you

---------12:07----------
were to stop giving the company money if

---------12:08----------
you would have listened to my advice if

---------12:10----------
you were to heed my recommendations I

---------12:12----------
would not have devices coming in the

---------12:14----------
door that would allow me to employ

---------12:15----------
people like an L over here or be able to

---------12:17----------
pay rent on a new store but what do I do

---------12:19----------
do I tell you no buy it it's great Apple

---------12:22----------
stuff is amazing or just keep my mouth

---------12:23----------
shut rather than chill no I give you my

---------12:26----------
honest professional opinion

---------12:28----------
just a little rant there and something I

---------12:30----------
want you to really think about when you

---------12:31----------
start questioning people's integrity

---------12:32----------
when their money is made their bread and

---------12:36----------
butter is fixing the very device that

---------12:38----------
they are begging you to stop buying and

---------12:40----------
spending money on that's it for today

---------12:42----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------12:44----------
something
