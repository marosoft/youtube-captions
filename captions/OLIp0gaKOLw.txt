---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're gonna be fixing an easy MacBook

---------00:03----------
Air that appears to be missing p.m.

---------00:05----------
sleep s4l this MacBook Air came from the

---------00:07----------
pall pile where all the boards that he

---------00:08----------
claims are unfixable cause excuses

---------00:11----------
usually sit but they're actually fairly

---------00:13----------
easy and today we're gonna demonstrate

---------00:14----------
that while mike koval a colleague over

---------00:17----------
here takes on another easy job of going

---------00:19----------
through all of the liquid damage quicks

---------00:21----------
from when my basement was flooded last

---------00:23----------
year isn't it fun to work at Rossman

---------00:26----------
repair indeed so we are going to get

---------00:30----------
started here and see what's wrong with

---------00:33----------
this MacBook Air so let's just turn on

---------00:35----------
the power supply software turn on Paul

---------00:37----------
Daniels is multimeter software all right

---------00:41----------
it's using 20 milliamps that's the lucky

---------00:45----------
Annelle number let's open up a schematic

---------00:46----------
and a board view and go to this board

---------00:48----------
and try and figure out why it's missing

---------00:50----------
PM sleep s4l what if it even is missing

---------00:53----------
PM sleep s4l perhaps Paul just made that

---------00:55----------
up also I need you all to remind me that

---------00:58----------
at 2:30 I have a meeting with Vision

---------01:00----------
engineering because they may just be

---------01:02----------
sponsoring us to put a microscope in a

---------01:04----------
video that is good I wanted to do a

---------01:08----------
piece on how organ ama is important I've

---------01:11----------
actually been thinking about when I get

---------01:12----------
the new space of having my personal

---------01:14----------
trainer show up and do a a workshop of

---------01:17----------
scapula exercise is that it is for

---------01:19----------
people that sit like this hunched over

---------01:21----------
all day like me cuz it's it's very

---------01:23----------
interesting like the in spite of the you

---------01:25----------
know 12 years of exercise I've been

---------01:26----------
doing and going at the gym regularly

---------01:27----------
I have worse flexibility in my in my

---------01:31----------
scapula area than a lot of people that

---------01:33----------
literally just started working with

---------01:35----------
because of the staring into the

---------01:37----------
microscope all day and I also was hoping

---------01:38----------
to have a now a good microscope that's

---------01:41----------
more comfortable for him when he shows

---------01:42----------
back up so let's see yeah I know I'm

---------01:47----------
milking that being an influencer thing

---------01:48----------
but I never use that influence or thing

---------01:50----------
for anything I can use it to reduce and

---------01:53----------
nails back pain alright so if we take a

---------01:58----------
look let's just see if we got some of

---------01:59----------
our main rails if I have PP 5vs5 I'll

---------02:02----------
know that I have pp bus g3 hot and see

---------02:07----------
if I got that I do do you pulse

---------02:10----------
you don't pulse I sponsor you to put

---------02:13----------
or you in your office 2020s is JP okay

---------02:17----------
we'll make Oreo the office cat

---------02:18----------
it looks like Paul is reflow the SMC

---------02:21----------
what Jackass would suggest that you

---------02:23----------
reflow the SMC just because you're

---------02:24----------
missing p.m. sleep best for L what [ __ ]

---------02:29----------
will recommend that that I delete

---------02:32----------
yesterday's dream yet [ __ ]

---------02:34----------
hi hi delete yesterday I mean what

---------02:38----------
stream yes what stream granstream air

---------02:40----------
stream like Eli has alright now dead

---------02:46----------
Thunderbolt chip can sometimes hold it

---------02:47----------
down we don't see a dead Thunderbolt

---------02:49----------
ship

---------03:05----------
ooh green green by smc interesting what

---------03:13----------
are you here the 3.3 volts for the EVF

---------03:16----------
or SMC and you're there and you're

---------03:21----------
steady

---------03:32----------
okay you're a pull up resistor that's

---------03:35----------
corroded over here

---------03:47----------
and you're a pull-up resistor for SMC

---------03:49----------
TCK that's gonna have one of the signals

---------03:52----------
required for the SMC to turn on but

---------03:55----------
unfortunately you are pulled up fully to

---------03:56----------
3.42 so we can't blame you and over here

---------04:01----------
as you can see we have corrosion by our

---------04:03----------
clock chip Wow this corrosion by the

---------04:05----------
clock chip this is the exact problem

---------04:06----------
that I had yesterday with my other p.m.

---------04:08----------
sleep s4l missing okay let's see if I

---------04:15----------
replace my clock chip and PM sleep best

---------04:16----------
for Oh works gonna grab myself a clock

---------04:21----------
chip you can get these at store across

---------04:22----------
from boob comm view nineteen hundred

---------04:25----------
stored Rossmann groov.com here and slot

---------04:39----------
II one okay I'm gonna get a chip from

---------04:40----------
slot II one can we go from there

---------04:43----------
Paul just gave me a PM sleep best

---------04:45----------
Ferrell that he spent a few hours on and

---------04:47----------
it's just a bad clock chip think Anna

---------04:50----------
told somebody that I'm not here and then

---------04:51----------
I showed up to pick up a chip I guess

---------04:53----------
she was saying that and she just said

---------04:55----------
well when did do is get here and this

---------04:56----------
really really very obviously dishonest

---------04:59----------
voice no it's like that's the standard

---------05:01----------
answer when somebody asks can I see Lois

---------05:03----------
is no because I I'm I can't I can't walk

---------05:07----------
up to the front every nine seconds but

---------05:08----------
that was that was awkward

---------05:11----------
that was funny oh no I mean like if you

---------05:17----------
show up to an Amazon warehouse do you

---------05:18----------
get to say is Jeff Bezos here then again

---------05:22----------
he's a multi-million multi billionaire

---------05:24----------
I'm just a bum so I get how there's a

---------05:25----------
difference anyone so we've went to store

---------05:27----------
dot rossmann group calm as you can see

---------05:29----------
here and we've purchased ourselves au

---------05:31----------
1900 s LG 3 NB one for 8cv chip and

---------05:34----------
that's gonna be our clock chip so what

---------05:37----------
do we go over in yesterday's dream what

---------05:38----------
do we go over in the video that I just

---------05:39----------
published today the importance of the

---------05:42----------
clock chip you know the clock chip is

---------05:44----------
gonna be needed so all the chips that

---------05:46----------
are running off of a particular clock

---------05:49----------
know when to get started so let's say

---------05:51----------
you have you know this machine does you

---------05:53----------
know first we execute this instruction

---------05:54----------
then this instruction then this

---------05:56----------
instruction in this introduction and

---------05:58----------
that's gonna happen on the clock so here

---------05:59----------
you have a 32 kilohertz clock

---------06:01----------
for the RTC and if that is not working

---------06:04----------
or that's executing in a jagged way and

---------06:06----------
then the instructions are not going to

---------06:07----------
get executed now PM sleep best for L

---------06:09----------
which is what's missing on this board

---------06:10----------
according to Paul is going to be

---------06:12----------
something that comes directly from the

---------06:14----------
SMC so let's just chase that back and

---------06:15----------
I'll show you where that is in the

---------06:16----------
schematic so that comes from here that

---------06:24----------
comes from let's just follow this back

---------06:30----------
Paul just put something on the board to

---------06:33----------
help fix it oh you [ __ ] truck yeah

---------06:39----------
it's all good now I can plug it in right

---------06:48----------
so somebody had the rice on this Wow

---------06:52----------
people still believe in this [ __ ] yeah

---------06:55----------
rice is definitely gonna get rid of all

---------06:56----------
that alright anyway so we're just gonna

---------07:00----------
go back here and go through so that

---------07:02----------
signal to create that power rail that

---------07:05----------
was missing comes from PM sleep best for

---------07:08----------
L p.m. sleep best for L comes directly

---------07:10----------
from the CPU and what also goes to the

---------07:12----------
CPU what also goes to the CPU the

---------07:14----------
real-time clock signal see that that

---------07:16----------
also goes to the CPU so if your

---------07:18----------
real-time clock signal is distorted or

---------07:20----------
jagat in some way it's going to stop

---------07:21----------
them board from working so let's once

---------07:23----------
and for all prove that Paul's Q is the

---------07:25----------
EZ Q in the store not mine by replacing

---------07:28----------
this one that was cherry-picked not by

---------07:31----------
me by Paul

---------07:38----------
Paul gave me the board that he spent

---------07:40----------
time on yesterday and we're gonna prove

---------07:41----------
that it's easy don't touch that dial

---------07:45----------
[Music]

---------08:14----------
so Paul if I wanted to make something so

---------08:17----------
that if somebody were to give a donation

---------08:19----------
it automatically releases a greenie how

---------08:22----------
difficult you think that would be like

---------08:27----------
if somebody donates $1 it gives one

---------08:29----------
greenie I think

---------08:52----------
what if one adheres yeah but Paul

---------08:56----------
Daniels this a greenie

---------09:03----------
a greenie

---------09:08----------
that would be an excellent way to turn

---------09:10----------
the cat into a total crackhead

---------10:03----------
and it fluxes hair and it a green needs

---------10:07----------
own age donator sounds like a Raspberry

---------10:08----------
Pi project to me yeah I'd have to learn

---------10:10----------
how to code I'm clueless like I don't

---------10:17----------
even know how to use the print command

---------10:57----------
okay so now we're going to wrap it cool

---------11:00----------
this board

---------11:20----------
okay it has the board has been rapid

---------11:22----------
cold now we're gonna see if we get fan

---------11:26----------
spin greenie donator aka thick cat

---------11:30----------
generator yes I think that that would be

---------11:32----------
fun alright so let's see what this does

---------11:35----------
okay do we get fan spin Paul this is not

---------11:38----------
fair no fan spin give me I need a fan

---------11:47----------
don't look you'll be mad all right do we

---------11:55----------
have fan spin

---------11:57----------
[Applause]

---------11:58----------
[Laughter]

---------12:15----------
the cloudship was corroded yeah but what

---------12:21----------
about the if even if it's putting out

---------12:22----------
three volts it doesn't mean that the

---------12:23----------
actual clock generation part of it is

---------12:25----------
there's three elements in the clock

---------12:26----------
generator so you have 25 megahertz you

---------12:28----------
have 32 kilohertz and you have three

---------12:30----------
point four volts even if the LDO inside

---------12:32----------
the clock chip is good the rest could be

---------12:34----------
bad because think about it the clock

---------12:35----------
trip takes P P 3 V 4 to N and P P 3 V 3

---------12:38----------
s 5 in and then it shoots out PP v RTC

---------12:41----------
g3 hot it's just passing through the

---------12:42----------
voltage that comes into it so the the

---------12:46----------
clock generator section of it is

---------12:48----------
separate from the part that makes power

---------12:50----------
either way this is fans bin

---------13:04----------
this is this a good probe yes you want

---------13:07----------
to try it I have the old clock chip here

---------13:08----------
if you want to measure it this would be

---------13:10----------
this would actually be an interesting

---------13:11----------
project guys do you want to see if this

---------13:13----------
has a clock with the old clock chip so

---------13:16----------
this is the old clock chip I didn't

---------13:17----------
overheat it or anything and this is the

---------13:19----------
MacBook Air board you know what'd be

---------13:25----------
really [ __ ] up is if you put the old

---------13:26----------
clock chip back on in a [ __ ] edit

---------13:28----------
Ed's odd because that would mean that

---------13:30----------
all this needed this whole time was flux

---------13:31----------
I replace it we're flowing it's not

---------13:41----------
gonna fix the generator inside because

---------13:42----------
even if it's creating power there's 25

---------13:44----------
megahertz 32 kilohertz and 3.3 volts and

---------13:47----------
they're all separate from each other

---------13:53----------
water a clock generator goes bad we've

---------13:56----------
in the tiniest bit of water it's not

---------13:58----------
like a power trip where you have to wait

---------13:59----------
until the power line has gone for it to

---------14:00----------
be broken or

---------14:07----------
the funny thing is that heat usually

---------14:09----------
kills crystals as well you were always

---------14:11----------
soldering right next to it and it

---------14:12----------
doesn't care I think this is because the

---------14:14----------
board absorbs a lot of heat yeah

---------14:18----------
that's why people were placed yeah a lot

---------14:22----------
of people replaced the BIOS on this but

---------14:23----------
when it's actually the 25 megahertz

---------14:25----------
crystal that's bad

---------14:35----------
I'm confident we can assume from this

---------14:38----------
sample size of one that the rest of your

---------14:39----------
queue is probably easy as well this is

---------14:44----------
all about attention to detail fall it's

---------14:46----------
about not going in there really fast and

---------14:48----------
just putting blobs of flux everywhere

---------14:50----------
and attention to detail you'll see Paul

---------14:56----------
once we start doing the construction of

---------14:58----------
the new store you'll see at the attempt

---------15:00----------
because you're going to be on vacation

---------15:01----------
when the construction starts so I'm

---------15:02----------
going to be starting the construction

---------15:03----------
and be the foreman and when you see what

---------15:05----------
your office looks like you could

---------15:06----------
understand what attention to detail

---------15:08----------
means

---------15:23----------
okay people watching how many how much

---------15:25----------
do you want to bet that the old clock

---------15:27----------
chip is now going to work simply because

---------15:28----------
I touched it so this is the old one

---------15:30----------
right

---------15:43----------
this this would be a real Frank Grimes

---------15:44----------
Homer Simpson moment

---------15:56----------
spin Paul's chair those your fans Minh

---------15:58----------
says the Welsh ones for one pound and 99

---------16:02----------
ounces

---------16:04----------
okay we're rapid cooling we're rapid

---------16:07----------
cooling

---------16:15----------
okay now you got to see if it gets fan

---------16:18----------
spin show the audience full show the

---------16:30----------
audience okay so it wasn't even that it

---------16:33----------
was the chip wasn't even bad that little

---------16:35----------
bit of green around it was enough to

---------16:36----------
corrupt the clock because think about

---------16:38----------
it's 32 killer it's in 25 megahertz you

---------16:40----------
don't have to mess up much to mess that

---------16:41----------
up

---------16:42----------
you refloat the SFC

---------16:46----------
there was corrosion of the clock chip oh

---------16:51----------
man oh man I think I can leave now I can

---------16:57----------
go home yeah that's the rule here so we

---------17:02----------
have a company rule which is if you

---------17:03----------
solve a problem that somebody else

---------17:04----------
wasn't able to solve then you become the

---------17:06----------
exclusive purveyor or a repair tech for

---------17:09----------
that type of problem that's how Chris

---------17:12----------
became the person that does all the

---------17:13----------
Thunderbolt chipra balls in Port

---------17:15----------
replacements JP says Paul is best cam

---------17:19----------
boy this is so funny I think an

---------17:24----------
ultrasonic would have fixed that

---------17:34----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------17:37----------
you learned something
