---------00:00----------
so here we're gonna open up a MacBook

---------00:01----------
Air that has no power this MacBook Air

---------00:04----------
no power was chosen at random for all

---------00:07----------
the different models and problems we

---------00:08----------
could have chosen from the slot you just

---------00:10----------
decided to choose this one because well

---------00:12----------
you know you know why

---------00:22----------
okay so what do you see inside this

---------00:25----------
MacBook what do you all see inside this

---------00:28----------
MacBook

---------00:43----------
let's see what you all notice

---------00:49----------
corrosion and where do you see that

---------00:51----------
corrosion

---------00:56----------
well so what else something else that

---------00:58----------
you may notice if you're paying

---------00:59----------
attention is that there's no light on

---------01:04----------
the charger now that is not a

---------01:06----------
coincidence that the no light and the

---------01:07----------
charger just so happens to coincide with

---------01:10----------
corrosion on OPP 3 before to circuit

---------01:12----------
over here

---------01:22----------
oh yeah and also our SMC reset area now

---------01:31----------
remember a VP 3v4 to underscore g3

---------01:34----------
Hunter Powell rail must be present in

---------01:37----------
order for the SMC to turn on also in

---------01:39----------
order for the one wire circuit to turn

---------01:40----------
on that allows the charge to speak to

---------01:42----------
the SMC so that you get a green line the

---------01:44----------
second thing that has to happen at the

---------01:45----------
pp 34 to underscore g3 hottes president

---------01:47----------
is the SMC is to not be in reset mode

---------01:48----------
because if it's stuck in reset mode then

---------01:50----------
it won't turn on those two areas are

---------01:52----------
right next to each other and they're

---------01:54----------
both corroded both powered by that same

---------01:55----------
people 342 underscore g3 hot rails and

---------01:57----------
most likely a when missing PP 3 before 2

---------01:59----------
1 squared G 300 B our essence he's not

---------02:01----------
turning on as a result for corroded SMC

---------02:03----------
reset circuit or could be all the above

---------02:05----------
there's only one way to find out

---------02:07----------
and we're gonna figure out which one of

---------02:08----------
those it is by turning on this

---------02:09----------
multimeter software here that is made by

---------02:13----------
Paul Daniels by the way we're just gonna

---------02:16----------
be making a quick public service

---------02:17----------
announcement today so the software that

---------02:20----------
allows the multimeter to show up on the

---------02:22----------
screen as well as the software that

---------02:25----------
stops me from losing my mind using that

---------02:28----------
1995 Lander X test link crap was all

---------02:32----------
programmed by our friend Paul Daniels

---------02:35----------
without Paul Daniels I would still be

---------02:36----------
using land direct software from 1995

---------02:39----------
rather than this beautiful software over

---------02:41----------
here which allows me to just bring up I

---------02:44----------
can essential I can click in an area and

---------02:46----------
it shows me everywhere it shows up on

---------02:47----------
the board it automatically brings me to

---------02:49----------
the space and the PDF it's at and this

---------02:51----------
was all coded by our friend and Paul

---------02:56----------
Daniels who you can find over here now

---------02:58----------
Paul Daniels is looking into purchasing

---------03:02----------
a house for himself and he's had quite a

---------03:05----------
few setbacks in the past few years but

---------03:08----------
he's finally found a place that where he

---------03:10----------
could actually properly fit his workshop

---------03:12----------
and his cats and his workspace into it's

---------03:15----------
a great opportunity for him and he's

---------03:17----------
just a couple of dollars short so he has

---------03:19----------
a PayPal donate link on his website now

---------03:21----------
something to consider here when it comes

---------03:23----------
to Paul Daniels is that while this

---------03:24----------
software that I'm using right here is a

---------03:26----------
paid version I was using his free

---------03:28----------
version for many

---------03:29----------
and his free version has virtually all

---------03:30----------
the features of the paid one except that

---------03:32----------
just doesn't have this little PDF button

---------03:34----------
on him but even in the free version of

---------03:35----------
the software you click it just shows you

---------03:38----------
every area on the board where signal

---------03:39----------
shows up it has autocomplete here he's

---------03:41----------
regularly updating it he's made the

---------03:43----------
multimeter software that I use it allows

---------03:45----------
you to see the multimeter voltage on the

---------03:46----------
screen freely available to all he's

---------03:49----------
really he's done a lot for the community

---------03:51----------
he's released a lot for the community

---------03:52----------
and the ratio of paid users to free

---------03:56----------
users is insa let me just say as such

---------04:00----------
that he may have difficulties getting

---------04:01----------
this house but I think it would be a

---------04:03----------
great if everybody chipped in a little

---------04:06----------
bit here because again if there's

---------04:08----------
anybody in this community that has

---------04:09----------
actually earned and deserves a little

---------04:11----------
bit of help every now and then it's the

---------04:13----------
people that are helping us to do our job

---------04:15----------
by finding ways to create software that

---------04:19----------
fills voids in the industry and Paul is

---------04:21----------
one of those people and he's done a

---------04:23----------
really really really good job I just

---------04:26----------
like to [ __ ] on him because every now

---------04:28----------
and then and joke about the quality of

---------04:29----------
the software just because well I'm an

---------04:31----------
[ __ ] but deep down in my heart he

---------04:33----------
does he does good stuff and I think he

---------04:34----------
deserves and not I shouldn't say dessert

---------04:37----------
I think he earned a little bit from the

---------04:39----------
people who use it so I'm not asking you

---------04:41----------
to donate if you're a regular person but

---------04:43----------
if you're somebody who uses open bored

---------04:45----------
videos if you've used the free version

---------04:47----------
of a software and you make money off of

---------04:49----------
it a dollar two dollars fifty cents

---------04:52----------
anything you have something because you

---------04:54----------
are using something that otherwise

---------04:55----------
wouldn't it existed so if you use Open

---------04:58----------
Board view if you won't if you use the

---------04:59----------
software and you've made money from it

---------05:01----------
give him a dollar or something so that's

---------05:04----------
about it now we're going to get to this

---------05:06----------
over here

---------05:09----------
so we're gonna see if we have PP 3v4 -

---------05:13----------
on here when I have the charger plugged

---------05:15----------
in let's take a look so this is where PP

---------05:18----------
3 before to underscore g3 hot would show

---------05:21----------
up that is a really nice microscope

---------05:24----------
camera image there and we have 1.33

---------05:28----------
so our problem here is not gonna be with

---------05:30----------
the SMC reset circuit it's gonna be with

---------05:32----------
people through before to underscore g3

---------05:34----------
huh not showing up remember

---------05:35----------
if you look on the schematic and the

---------05:37----------
board view pp 3 V 4 2 is going to be the

---------05:41----------
power rail that powers the SMC chip so

---------05:43----------
this is the SMC down here and the SMC is

---------05:47----------
powered on many balls by pp 3 V 4 to

---------05:50----------
underscore GG 3 huh you need that rail

---------05:53----------
to be present if that's not present

---------05:54----------
nothing's gonna turn on so we are going

---------05:56----------
to try and figure that out so let's get

---------06:00----------
the board out of the casing

---------06:18----------
[Music]

---------06:30----------
[Music]

---------06:37----------
what do you wear when you bike whatever

---------06:40----------
I usually wear I suppose I don't dress

---------06:42----------
up specially for it lovely

---------06:59----------
okay now there's a lot of corrosion here

---------07:01----------
but can anybody tell me what the actual

---------07:03----------
relevant part of the corrosion is but

---------07:05----------
also tell me why that part of corrosion

---------07:07----------
is relevant if you can follow along to

---------07:08----------
the circuit if you can follow along on

---------07:11----------
screen using open board view

---------07:12----------
I am blurred donate five dollars thank

---------07:19----------
you very much to blur and highly

---------07:21----------
appreciate that okay

---------07:27----------
this resistor here appears to be the

---------07:30----------
worst off so let's see what happens if

---------07:35----------
we were to simply hot air

---------08:20----------
[Music]

---------08:26----------
[Music]

---------08:52----------
[Music]

---------09:17----------
sometime

---------09:20----------
all three

---------09:27----------
now we plug it in

---------09:32----------
you know we check our voltage

---------09:47----------
little word

---------09:52----------
and as you can see here we have P P 3 P

---------09:55----------
4 2 is now presently and we have 500

---------09:57----------
milliamps which means our fan is

---------09:59----------
probably spinning and it is spinning

---------10:01----------
which means it works proving once and

---------10:04----------
for all that I do indeed get all the

---------10:06----------
hard board repairs and Paul gets all the

---------10:08----------
easy [ __ ] I had to rip coating off of

---------10:12----------
those capacitors I had to turn on my hot

---------10:14----------
air station yes I had to lift up and

---------10:16----------
push this flux with my right thumb the

---------10:19----------
difficulty I hope you all have some

---------10:23----------
sympathy and appreciation for what I go

---------10:25----------
through here
