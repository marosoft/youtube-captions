---------00:00----------
alright so today we're going to be going

---------00:01----------
over a macbook pro retina that is not

---------00:03----------
sleeping when you close the lid after a

---------00:06----------
liquid spill we're going to go through

---------00:07----------
how you would troubleshoot something

---------00:09----------
like this and I got lucky here but we're

---------00:12----------
also going to go over some of my

---------00:14----------
frustration with Apple I no surprise

---------00:16----------
 surprise that I have something

---------00:18----------
bad to say about Apple on this channel

---------00:21----------
so one of the things that you should

---------00:23----------
understand is that there is a signal

---------00:25----------
called smc underscore lid when this

---------00:28----------
signal is asserted okay to be you know I

---------00:31----------
should have looked this up before I did

---------00:33----------
this I obviously don't even remember I

---------00:35----------
think the way that this works is when

---------00:37----------
this is the lid the signal is high it

---------00:40----------
thinks that the screen is not closed and

---------00:42----------
not closed and when the signal is low it

---------00:46----------
thinks the screen is closed or the other

---------00:48----------
way around to be honest with you I don't

---------00:50----------
even remember because I have this

---------00:51----------
problem very very rarely i think i can

---------00:55----------
actually look this up let's take a look

---------00:56----------
and see if i look this up smc underscore

---------01:01----------
lid on an older board it'll probably

---------01:06----------
tell me here here we go lid open

---------01:08----------
three-point 42 volts lid closed 0.5

---------01:11----------
volts so low the lid is closed high the

---------01:14----------
lid is open so let's take a look at this

---------01:18----------
on the schematic over here so what I do

---------01:20----------
is I go through smc lid and I try to

---------01:23----------
figure out what the sleep sensor is

---------01:24----------
because on these newer machines the

---------01:26----------
sleep center is integrated into the

---------01:27----------
motherboard itself and here we have a

---------01:29----------
hall sensor or lid sensor it used to be

---------01:32----------
called the hall sensor on really really

---------01:34----------
old laptops I'm not sure if you guys

---------01:36----------
remember back that far I know I got a

---------01:38----------
lot of new young subscribers on this

---------01:39----------
channel laptops used to have that little

---------01:41----------
thing that sticks up out of it right by

---------01:43----------
the top of the keyboard this little this

---------01:45----------
point and if you pressed it it would

---------01:47----------
actually put the laptop to sleep it was

---------01:49----------
a used to be a physical sense or before

---------01:51----------
they had magnets and all that to do the

---------01:53----------
job but now they have a magnet to do the

---------01:56----------
job and they have this little hall

---------01:57----------
sensor so if we go back to the schematic

---------01:59----------
here you can see it in the drawing so

---------02:01----------
this is what I'm going to guess the hall

---------02:03----------
sensor because it says Hall dash sensor

---------02:05----------
which come on now obvious so what's

---------02:08----------
going on here is smc underscore lid

---------02:11----------
underscore are as a signal that comes

---------02:12----------
from the hall sensor

---------02:14----------
and then it goes through the zero ohm

---------02:15----------
resistor where it then becomes smc lid

---------02:19----------
and smc lid is going to go straight to

---------02:26----------
the SMC again big surprise their smc

---------02:29----------
underscore lid what do you think manages

---------02:31----------
the machine knowing if it's open or

---------02:33----------
closed with the signal line named smc

---------02:35----------
underscore lid the SMC sm c stands for

---------02:38----------
system management role now if we were to

---------02:41----------
go over to this beautiful new board view

---------02:43----------
software that somebody put together for

---------02:44----------
me thank you so much by the way I really

---------02:46----------
appreciate this and we look for our 5250

---------02:52----------
this new board view they see can you see

---------02:57----------
what I see yeah you can you'll see that

---------02:59----------
it's right over here now if we go over

---------03:01----------
to the microscope alright so I up

---------03:04----------
my my my open broadcaster scene so I'm

---------03:07----------
overdubbing this after the fact so I

---------03:09----------
didn't notice that I wasn't recording

---------03:10----------
audio so the first thing that you're

---------03:12----------
going to notice if I go to this area

---------03:13----------
where smc lid is around where what this

---------03:16----------
thing over here which is what i can

---------03:17----------
assume the sleep sensor is the thing is

---------03:18----------
copyright 2010 i'm assuming that's the

---------03:21----------
sleep sensor and when you zoom in you're

---------03:22----------
going to notice that it looks like

---------03:24----------
there's a resistor next to that

---------03:25----------
capacitor that is missing and if you

---------03:27----------
take a look you can really see where the

---------03:29----------
damage was because right where this

---------03:31----------
traces its going to a probe pad that's

---------03:33----------
destroyed so I like to think of that as

---------03:36----------
kind of with a lightning struck when it

---------03:37----------
comes to liquid damage so anytime I see

---------03:39----------
that I kind of think that way so what

---------03:40----------
I'm going to do here is I'm going to

---------03:41----------
scrape away because you may think that

---------03:43----------
there's no pad there you may think

---------03:45----------
there's no pet oh my god I can't solder

---------03:47----------
this and as soon as you start scraping

---------03:49----------
away at it what you're going to notice

---------03:50----------
is that there is actually a pad there

---------03:52----------
and that there isn't any real serious

---------03:55----------
problem you can just simply scrape away

---------03:56----------
once you've scraped away all of the

---------03:58----------
corrosion then you'll be set and you'll

---------04:01----------
be able to go over it with some flux and

---------04:04----------
solder and you'll have what can you know

---------04:06----------
not really a solder pad but you'll have

---------04:08----------
something that you can use as a solder

---------04:10----------
pet now a lot of people in this business

---------04:12----------
like to talk about things like like like

---------04:15----------
pad repair kits and I get a lot of

---------04:17----------
common saying you're not professional

---------04:19----------
because you're not repairing the pad and

---------04:20----------
the reality is that the pad repair kits

---------04:23----------
are the first things first pad repair

---------04:25----------
kits they're really kind of

---------04:28----------
bigger devices they're not for devices

---------04:30----------
that are you know 0201 resistors and

---------04:32----------
when we're getting down and doing pad

---------04:33----------
repair on 0201 devices I mean that it's

---------04:37----------
just not practical for what we're doing

---------04:39----------
again this is not firstly I would fully

---------04:41----------
endorse using this method on you know I

---------04:43----------
would use this on a space shuttle that I

---------04:45----------
was on seriously but even if we you know

---------04:49----------
you're paranoid about that this is not a

---------04:50----------
space shuttle it's a laptop or a cell

---------04:52----------
phone this is a totally valid way to

---------04:54----------
repair because by the time you've

---------04:57----------
actually gone through all the effort to

---------04:59----------
put a new pad there and you've gone

---------05:00----------
through all that effort you've taken

---------05:02----------
away a lot of time and keep in mind a

---------05:04----------
lot of these jobs they got to be done in

---------05:05----------
20 to 40 minutes or else it goes in the

---------05:07----------
trash so if you're in the middle of

---------05:09----------
troubleshooting I may replace this

---------05:11----------
component and it may not work so if I

---------05:12----------
replace this component the minute it

---------05:14----------
doesn't work that's fine if I spend 40

---------05:16----------
minutes on 20 minutes or 30 minutes on

---------05:18----------
one single component then it kind of

---------05:20----------
stops being practical so you're going to

---------05:22----------
see what I'm going to do here is I

---------05:23----------
cleaned it off I scraped it away with my

---------05:25----------
tweezers and now I'm just going to run

---------05:27----------
solder and with flux day and you'll see

---------05:29----------
that I'm scraping because I want to make

---------05:30----------
sure that I you know I have a nice clean

---------05:33----------
surface that I'm soldering to and you

---------05:35----------
may ask why is it that I'm adding so

---------05:37----------
much Tyler that's ridiculous

---------05:38----------
well all of that excess is going to

---------05:41----------
stick to the elbow of my tip so you're

---------05:43----------
going to notice that my soldering tip

---------05:44----------
here has an elbow on it is a t15 dash J

---------05:47----------
so2 from hako and if you notice all the

---------05:51----------
excess solder it's not going to stay on

---------05:53----------
the board you're not gonna have a clump

---------05:54----------
of solder it's all going to get sucked

---------05:56----------
up onto that tip so what I'm doing there

---------05:57----------
is what the the flux is doing its pretty

---------06:00----------
much kind of cleaning the board and you

---------06:02----------
also have that big vat of solder we're

---------06:04----------
pretty much any dirt or any junk is

---------06:05----------
getting sucked into that vat of solder

---------06:07----------
that's going on in my tip so what I wind

---------06:09----------
up with once I clean the flux away is to

---------06:12----------
very clean quote pads end quote where

---------06:16----------
you're going to see here and it looks

---------06:17----------
like we're getting very close to the

---------06:19----------
part where I was not an idiot and I

---------06:21----------
actually have audio so since we're

---------06:23----------
getting very close to that part I can

---------06:25----------
now turn this microphone off yay he is

---------06:30----------
back in action I did fine I did send it

---------06:33----------
to them this was two hundred ninety

---------06:35----------
bucks that's the discounted rate so two

---------06:39----------
hundred ninety dollars was the

---------06:41----------
discounted rate to get this

---------06:44----------
thing back but you know what that's

---------06:46----------
totally fine by me I didn't get a new

---------06:48----------
nozzle my nozzle looks like because

---------06:49----------
it keeps dropping one thing you know the

---------06:52----------
hack Oh was a piece of crap compared to

---------06:54----------
the JBC there's no there's no way around

---------06:55----------
I mean like it was just much worse in

---------06:58----------
many ways but the one thing I liked

---------06:59----------
about is it didn't fall off the desk

---------07:00----------
this little stand that the JBC comes

---------07:03----------
with like it is so easy to knock this

---------07:05----------
 off the table it's ridiculous look

---------07:07----------
as whoops so what happens is the nozzle

---------07:10----------
of this $2,000 instrument winds

---------07:12----------
up falling onto the floor over and over

---------07:13----------
again and getting just destroyed I like

---------07:16----------
the hack off for having the nice side

---------07:17----------
mount so let's get started here with

---------07:19----------
this I'm going to stop bitching about

---------07:20----------
the JBC it's just one thing to think

---------07:22----------
about because again this thing is 2,000

---------07:24----------
 dollars it would be nice if this

---------07:25----------
little hold it over here we're worth

---------07:27----------
more than ten bucks but it feels nice

---------07:30----------
it's like it's not it's not light it's

---------07:31----------
just the way that this is put together

---------07:32----------
it's just designed to leverage it in a

---------07:35----------
manner where it's always going to fall

---------07:37----------
off the table and I didn't realize you

---------07:41----------
know just how much better this was in

---------07:42----------
the hako until honestly I mean I knew it

---------07:45----------
was better but I didn't realize just how

---------07:47----------
by leaps and bounds it was until I tried

---------07:50----------
to remove an smc with the hack oh and

---------07:51----------
six minutes in the smc wasn't off the

---------07:53----------
board I was able to give the thing a

---------07:56----------
reflow temperature within 45 seconds

---------07:58----------
with the jbc now you can't say anything

---------08:00----------
can you alright and we're back to the

---------08:02----------
part where I had no audio because I'm a

---------08:04----------
 that forgot how to use open

---------08:06----------
broadcaster so what i'm doing here is

---------08:07----------
i'm also going to remove that capacitor

---------08:09----------
on the left the capacitor itself is

---------08:11----------
probably fine that's cosmetic damage

---------08:12----------
it's a little bit of wear and tear to be

---------08:14----------
honest if they don't wind up you know

---------08:16----------
spilling something again that cap

---------08:18----------
probably could have been reused this is

---------08:20----------
just me having a bit of OCD me and yeah

---------08:23----------
but that's we're going to replace that

---------08:25----------
and same general procedure too much flux

---------08:31----------
as always

---------08:36----------
now keep in mind that probe point on the

---------08:39----------
bottom that is destroyed it doesn't

---------08:41----------
actually matter you that part where the

---------08:42----------
trace is going to that's a test point

---------08:44----------
that's not actually going to anything so

---------08:46----------
if you look in the schematic smc lid is

---------08:48----------
going to smc lid r is going to go from

---------08:51----------
the resistor to the other side of the

---------08:54----------
resistor where then becomes smc lid that

---------08:57----------
then goes to the capacitor and from that

---------08:59----------
capacitor it actually goes to the SMC

---------09:00----------
but it's an item I am pretty sure it's

---------09:03----------
not going to the SMC through that and

---------09:06----------
that that that try could be wrong I

---------09:08----------
could be on some actually no I

---------09:11----------
don't think I'm on some because

---------09:12----------
why would the signal before the resistor

---------09:14----------
go to the SMC yeah that that probe point

---------09:16----------
is pretty much worthless it's used

---------09:18----------
camcorder okay watch see this focus not

---------09:22----------
focus focus not focus these really small

---------09:24----------
differences these really small

---------09:26----------
differences in board height will affect

---------09:28----------
it whereas when you have the folk when

---------09:30----------
you have the zoomed out like this at

---------09:31----------
like let's say seven X it doesn't make a

---------09:34----------
difference you see that so when people

---------09:36----------
ask me why is it that I'm okay with the

---------09:38----------
microscope that only has the 10 and the

---------09:39----------
40 X to the 10 and the 30x of the lower

---------09:41----------
zoom is the thing is is that the lower

---------09:44----------
zoom itself is actually really easy to

---------09:47----------
work with whereas again when you zoom in

---------09:49----------
and this is just 20 X right here this

---------09:50----------
isn't even 40 or 50 or 90 or any of that

---------09:52----------
crazy as soon as you touch the

---------09:54----------
border you move it a little bit you're

---------09:56----------
out of focus and it really makes you

---------09:57----------
dizzy so one of the things I talk about

---------10:00----------
on this channel is making it easy for

---------10:02----------
yourself to do this work over long

---------10:04----------
periods of time and how to be efficient

---------10:06----------
and had to be good at this if you're

---------10:07----------
only a one-person shop like I am doing

---------10:11----------
all these repairs and one of the ways

---------10:12----------
that i keep my eyes from getting tired

---------10:14----------
on my head from getting too tired is i

---------10:16----------
keep myself zoomed out so I don't you

---------10:19----------
know I don't buy into this that

---------10:21----------
you know the only way to do this with

---------10:24----------
with ultra accuracies to you know be in

---------10:26----------
a dick waving contest about the zoom

---------10:28----------
level and zoom all the way in that's not

---------10:29----------
you no more zoom is not necessarily

---------10:31----------
better it just in my opinion more zoom

---------10:34----------
just gives you more of a

---------10:36----------
headache and you also that's not

---------10:38----------
soldered on there I know it's

---------10:40----------
alright so we're back here and you can

---------10:43----------
see the capacitor is not properly

---------10:44----------
soldered on the board and I don't care

---------10:46----------
the reason I don't care is because there

---------10:48----------
is still ample amounts of flux on the

---------10:49----------
board and when I have to solder the

---------10:52----------
resistor in place that's next to it

---------10:53----------
that's solder with two DS s 0 DD er

---------10:56----------
thank you wet dictionary.com for

---------10:59----------
pointing it out to me but when you see

---------11:00----------
you're going to see once i saw to the

---------11:01----------
resistor that these surface tension is

---------11:03----------
going to ensure that that capacitor

---------11:05----------
flows right into place now keep in mind

---------11:07----------
that that's not something that can

---------11:08----------
happen unless you have flux present the

---------11:11----------
reason that you cannot solder something

---------11:13----------
and then continually to add heat without

---------11:15----------
adding new solder or new flux is that

---------11:18----------
there's usually flux inside of the

---------11:19----------
solder that you're using so if you just

---------11:22----------
simply if you just simply keep adding

---------11:24----------
you know heat without adding new solder

---------11:27----------
with flux in it or flux on the board

---------11:29----------
you're going to notice that your joints

---------11:30----------
come out all crappy they look like these

---------11:32----------
little Hershey's kisses so if you're

---------11:34----------
kind of wondering why the ends of your

---------11:35----------
solder joints don't look like the

---------11:36----------
factory and have all these little spikes

---------11:38----------
sticking up out of them it's mostly

---------11:40----------
likely because you ran out of flux okay

---------11:44----------
since there's no audio from the original

---------11:45----------
video at this point I don't know what

---------11:47----------
the hell it was I was doing Wow why are

---------11:50----------
you why are you just showing us a

---------11:52----------
picture of the bored in the

---------11:54----------
microscope [ __ ] what were you doing

---------11:56----------
who are you helping a customer were you

---------11:59----------
taking a piss were you just aah jaka the

---------12:02----------
idiot moves something so I think he's

---------12:04----------
finally about to get back to work come

---------12:08----------
on now don't make me have to edit I

---------12:09----------
hate editing you know the thing is I

---------12:12----------
actually like doing YouTube videos i

---------12:14----------
genuinely enjoy it but I hate

---------12:16----------
editing I've just kind of gotten to this

---------12:17----------
point where I don't want to listen to

---------12:19----------
myself talk I don't want to see myself

---------12:21----------
work the the worst punishment that you

---------12:24----------
could give me at the end of a day is to

---------12:26----------
make me sit through hours of my own

---------12:28----------
repairs editing videos and it's

---------12:31----------
just like stupid that I want

---------12:33----------
abetting it seem like it's me going to

---------12:35----------
the bathroom me helping a customer

---------12:36----------
somebody calling and cursing or you know

---------12:39----------
just it's just stupid like that

---------12:41----------
that I know I have to edit because again

---------12:44----------
I have a wireless microphone there's

---------12:46----------
really no reason for you to hear me in

---------12:47----------
the bathroom but anyway here's here's

---------12:49----------
the money shot you're going to see that

---------12:51----------
everything flows right into place and

---------12:52----------
it's not going to go out of focus but

---------12:54----------
i'm only at 7x see that it's called

---------12:56----------
surface tension everything just flows

---------12:57----------
right into place BAM and the flux is

---------13:00----------
heated away so I wait until the flux

---------13:03----------
kind of heated a way to put the hot air

---------13:04----------
really close when it but the hot a

---------13:05----------
really close it just flows and now we're

---------13:08----------
on to the next video clip okay so here

---------13:11----------
I'm going to hold up the machine and you

---------13:13----------
see a ? folder right so now I'm going to

---------13:15----------
take my magnets that I'm using to hold

---------13:17----------
all the screws over here when I put it

---------13:19----------
right where the whole sensor should be

---------13:22----------
it turns off now I do this and it's back

---------13:25----------
but I put it over here it turns off

---------13:28----------
which means that we fixed the problem

---------13:31----------
with the hall sensor now here we had the

---------13:34----------
opposite of what the usual problem is so

---------13:36----------
I figure I should tell you at the very

---------13:37----------
least what the usual problem is usually

---------13:39----------
the issue is not that the computer never

---------13:41----------
goes to sleep rather the issue is that

---------13:43----------
there's a broken capacitor or a broken

---------13:45----------
hall sensor that's keeping the smc lid

---------13:48----------
signal low at zero volts and what this

---------13:50----------
will cause is random freezing randomly

---------13:53----------
not waking from sleep or no backlight

---------13:56----------
because keep in mind that the screen

---------13:58----------
itself is not going to be on if it

---------13:59----------
thinks the lid is closed so these are

---------14:02----------
some of the issues where people will

---------14:03----------
search for the backlight circuit they'll

---------14:05----------
search power circuits they'll search all

---------14:06----------
different things but they won't look at

---------14:09----------
the smc lids signal and the reason the

---------14:11----------
smc lid signal is important is because

---------14:12----------
again all these other problems and all

---------14:14----------
these other parts of the machine can be

---------14:16----------
caused by the smc lid signal being low

---------14:18----------
so it's something to look at something

---------14:20----------
to think about and also again this is

---------14:22----------
one of those things that people try to

---------14:23----------
fix with the whole heat gunning in the

---------14:24----------
oven thing if that capacitor is shorting

---------14:27----------
the ground so let's just go over this

---------14:28----------
again smc lid I know some of the new

---------14:34----------
subscribers are going to think I'm

---------14:35----------
picking on Linus here I'm really not

---------14:37----------
trying to pick on him when i say oven

---------14:38----------
i've been talking about this oven thing

---------14:41----------
on this channel for years because it's a

---------14:42----------
very very common practice in our

---------14:44----------
industry it's been a practice long

---------14:46----------
before Linus even at a channel so i'm

---------14:48----------
not trying to snark on Linus here

---------14:49----------
because every every time I mentioned the

---------14:51----------
word oven now I realize that people are

---------14:52----------
like mentioning him and okay yes i did a

---------14:56----------
douchey video on him talking about ovens

---------14:58----------
but that was one time only and he and we

---------15:01----------
talked about it and he's honestly a nice

---------15:04----------
guy that actually cares about people

---------15:05----------
doing stuff the right way

---------15:07----------
for the most part you know so I'm not

---------15:09----------
talking about him but what I'm talking

---------15:11----------
about here is see these capacitors over

---------15:13----------
here sometimes if these capacitors are

---------15:14----------
screwed up they'll actually work again

---------15:16----------
with heat so let's say this capacitor is

---------15:18----------
shorten the ground or something right

---------15:19----------
you can actually kind of temporarily

---------15:21----------
stop that from happening by heating it

---------15:23----------
so let's say this is shorten the ground

---------15:25----------
it's going to make the computer think

---------15:27----------
that the lid is closed when it's not

---------15:28----------
closed it's just one of those things

---------15:29----------
that I want you to be aware of because

---------15:31----------
again I see it all the time especially

---------15:33----------
with new students that come here they

---------15:35----------
start checking the back light circuit

---------15:36----------
the power circuit the CPU vcore circuit

---------15:38----------
they check all these different things

---------15:40----------
when instead of just checking like does

---------15:43----------
the computer think that it's sleeping if

---------15:45----------
the computer thinks it's sleeping it's

---------15:47----------
not going to work regardless of whether

---------15:49----------
everything else is in good condition

---------15:51----------
it's a very common defect and it's

---------15:54----------
something that I think you should look

---------15:55----------
for now the reason that I'm pissed off

---------15:56----------
with this one is because there's no

---------16:00----------
schematic for it so i'm actually using

---------16:02----------
the schematic for an older motherboard

---------16:03----------
just hoping that nothing changed again

---------16:05----------
if something changed in this design for

---------16:07----------
all I know I put the wrong on this

---------16:08----------
machine i'm using a schematic for a 2013

---------16:12----------
Haswell on a 2015-16 machine because i

---------16:16----------
can't get the schematic to this

---------16:18----------
bored now luckily common sense just

---------16:20----------
looking at the circuit looking at how

---------16:22----------
simple it is looking at how it works I

---------16:23----------
know that nothing actually changed but

---------16:26----------
what if everything changed what if

---------16:27----------
everything had changed all together it

---------16:29----------
was completely different I'd never

---------16:31----------
solved this I still have the schematic

---------16:32----------
for this machine and that sucks but that

---------16:34----------
is Apple and that is what I deal with in

---------16:37----------
order to do my job that's it for today

---------16:39----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------16:40----------
something
