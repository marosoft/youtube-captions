---------00:00----------
here we have an a 1502 motherboard this

---------00:02----------
is for the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro

---------00:04----------
this is an 8 - 0 - 30 476 board and

---------00:08----------
let's take a look at what it's doing how

---------00:10----------
its behaving and see if we can make this

---------00:12----------
thing work again okay so this is taking

---------00:15----------
80 milliamps 80 milliamps and not

---------00:19----------
turning on now this is interesting

---------00:20----------
because typically when we have PM's

---------00:22----------
leave s4l missing it's going to take 15

---------00:25----------
to 30 mil and when we have a short to

---------00:27----------
ground on PP bus g3 hot it's going to be

---------00:30----------
taking maybe 150 to 200 milliamps and

---------00:32----------
also power good is missing we're usually

---------00:34----------
taking 150 milliamps so I'm not really

---------00:36----------
sure 80 milliamps and not turning on is

---------00:39----------
a new one for me and that that's really

---------00:43----------
the thing so let's take a look and over

---------00:47----------
this board and see if there's anything

---------00:48----------
obvious here you someone says you see

---------00:50----------
how adblock hurts people like Louis it

---------00:52----------
doesn't it's I wouldn't use the word

---------00:53----------
hurt because like the word hurt means

---------00:55----------
they're like ah I'm suffering it doesn't

---------00:58----------
hurt me it just makes me make it just

---------01:00----------
causes me to make the choice to not do

---------01:02----------
this as a profession like when you look

---------01:04----------
at my backdrop again you look at it like

---------01:05----------
a Linus video polished beautiful you

---------01:08----------
look at my background and it's like a

---------01:10----------
 up wall with like a door to a

---------01:12----------
circuit breaker panel that's like

---------01:15----------
missing a thing over there when you look

---------01:17----------
at that or like you look at the overhead

---------01:18----------
cam and my overhead cam is not even

---------01:21----------
straight like the reason I don't align

---------01:23----------
this the reason I don't care about all

---------01:25----------
of this the reason I don't go through

---------01:27----------
effort to make the setup look beautiful

---------01:29----------
is just because I realized that over 70

---------01:32----------
percent of my audience is using a plugin

---------01:34----------
so that I don't make my so look it's not

---------01:37----------
it doesn't hurt me it just causes me to

---------01:39----------
make the conscious decision that I am

---------01:41----------
NOT going to put a stupid amount of

---------01:43----------
effort in to make this stuff look all

---------01:45----------
fancy schmancy like let's say vice would

---------01:48----------
have because they would have been making

---------01:49----------
crazy amounts of ad revenue

---------01:51----------
you know I'll I'll post my videos to

---------01:53----------
Vimeo I will make sure that the content

---------01:55----------
is available so people can learn but in

---------01:57----------
terms of making all the like

---------01:58----------
fancy-schmancy professional or having

---------02:01----------
you know or doing a stream at a special

---------02:04----------
time when there's not going to be any

---------02:05----------
distractions or scripting it so that

---------02:07----------
like if I go to wash a board in the

---------02:09----------
ultrasonic cleaner you're just not

---------02:10----------
sitting here on hold for 20 minutes

---------02:34----------
looks like a little bugs skin or

---------02:36----------
something over there

---------03:05----------
hmm

---------03:13----------
what are you interesting

---------03:23----------
so the chip that you're looking at here

---------03:25----------
that looks nasty and the capacitor that

---------03:27----------
looks nasty is the chip that creates the

---------03:29----------
RTC real time clock clock signal as well

---------03:33----------
as one of the main power rails for the

---------03:36----------
clock so we're going to do here is erase

---------03:42----------
this part of the board much erasing to

---------03:51----------
be done

---------07:05----------
if you need to buy a clock ship you can

---------07:07----------
buy it for the low low price of 649 in

---------07:10----------
stock same day shipping spend more than

---------07:13----------
$30 within the continental United States

---------07:15----------
and will even give you free shipping

---------07:19----------
don't delay buy your chips from store

---------07:23----------
dot Rossman group calm today

---------08:40----------
[Music]

---------08:56----------
now we're taking 40 milliamps I just put

---------09:01----------
the wrong chip there holy crap I'm

---------09:04----------
losing my goddamn mind

---------09:05----------
good evening I'm a jazz suggestin kouya

---------09:08----------
Kuroda's Rising Sun I will check it out

---------09:11----------
thank you very much did I seriously put

---------09:13----------
the wrong chip there oh my god I did I

---------09:16----------
put an SMC research ship there four

---------09:18----------
o'clock sir holy crap oh my god I'm

---------09:23----------
coming a franchise before my very eyes I

---------09:26----------
am becoming a franchise oh my god I feel

---------09:33----------
sick to my stomach right now

---------09:35----------
in addition to every other way I have

---------09:38----------
failed in life I just fixed the board

---------09:41----------
the way that a franchise would how do I

---------09:44----------
even live with myself

---------09:58----------
right

---------11:54----------
it looks like we're taking an amp now

---------11:59----------
six hundred milliamps and we have a fan

---------12:02----------
spin this machine seems to have an issue

---------12:04----------
with its clock rail and it's clock chip

---------12:06----------
we replaced it using a chip that we

---------12:09----------
could buy on store dot Rosman group.com

---------12:12----------
and now the board is giving us a

---------12:15----------
glorious fan spin if that's not the best

---------12:17----------
plug you've ever heard forced or doubt

---------12:19----------
Rossman group.com I'm not quite sure

---------12:21----------
