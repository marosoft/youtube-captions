---------00:00----------
okay so today we're gonna go over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero 3209 that has no backlight

---------00:03----------
before I go over what's wrong with this

---------00:05----------
boy let's go over what's wrong with the

---------00:06----------
shipping so this board came in a little

---------00:09----------
box it had an envelope on it it was a

---------00:11----------
envelope and then a box inside the

---------00:13----------
envelope the envelope looks it came kind

---------00:15----------
of really tattered and crappy looking

---------00:17----------
because I had a box inside of it so we

---------00:19----------
rip up the envelope you see a box with a

---------00:21----------
Chinese return address on it and a

---------00:23----------
motherboard inside of it with no note no

---------00:25----------
nothing this has been sitting in a slot

---------00:28----------
for about you know three weeks waiting

---------00:31----------
for us to somebody to call and tell us

---------00:33----------
that they sent us it and we got a call

---------00:35----------
for status and I said hmm is this an air

---------00:37----------
board that came in a yellow box with no

---------00:39----------
note so long story short if you don't

---------00:42----------
include a note we get like 10 20 30

---------00:44----------
little packages and envelopes in the

---------00:46----------
mail everyday if you don't include a

---------00:47----------
note with your name your phone number

---------00:49----------
and order number anything that I can go

---------00:52----------
off of so that I have a clue what this

---------00:53----------
is I'm going to assume that it was a

---------00:55----------
supplier that sent it by mistake or a

---------00:57----------
gift so like anything just will go I

---------01:00----------
could use almost anything but just put

---------01:02----------
something in the box that says what it

---------01:03----------
is so that I know what you know and like

---------01:06----------
what what to expect cause this has been

---------01:08----------
this was like days away from getting

---------01:11----------
tossed into the trash anyway so this is

---------01:13----------
a no backlight problem so let's just

---------01:15----------
take a look at some of the backlight

---------01:17----------
area here looks like somebody tried to

---------01:19----------
do something themself and let's let's

---------01:21----------
just walk through and see what happened

---------01:22----------
here so this is the backlight for use

---------01:24----------
where you see the little peak now you

---------01:26----------
can't see that just yet see there we

---------01:28----------
have a nice little P know if I do this

---------01:33----------
and I try to measure it let's see if you

---------01:36----------
can see that so let's see if the

---------01:37----------
backlight fuse it's good it's fine the

---------01:42----------
connector looks fine now when you look

---------01:43----------
around the LED driver area that's when

---------01:45----------
it starts to get a little suspect so

---------01:47----------
you've been missing capacitor over here

---------01:48----------
which while important is not super duper

---------01:50----------
critical but what's really critical here

---------01:53----------
you can see that the feedback ball is

---------01:56----------
kind of damaged underneath the chip

---------01:57----------
which is very typical from liquid damage

---------02:00----------
it's not too damaged but you know enough

---------02:02----------
so but the main issue here is that the

---------02:04----------
backlight enable resistor one of them is

---------02:06----------
missing so there's a voltage divider

---------02:07----------
that takes the power going to the back

---------02:09----------
light circuit and turns that eight volt

---------02:10----------
into something like two point seven

---------02:13----------
three volts for the backlight enable in

---------02:15----------
and that's missing that resistor is gone

---------02:19----------
maybe it was knocked off when somebody

---------02:20----------
was soldering maybe it came off in the

---------02:22----------
cleaner I've been there I've knocked

---------02:24----------
stuff off before so that's like this

---------02:28----------
this is something that I can't I can't

---------02:29----------
really criticize because yeah I've done

---------02:33----------
that definitely been there and done that

---------02:35----------
so let's just let's just go over the

---------02:37----------
backlight circuit on this particular

---------02:38----------
machine let's find it so what's missing

---------02:42----------
here is this CR 9 731 so this is part of

---------02:44----------
a voltage divider so this is the DC to

---------02:46----------
DC boost circuit you should watch my

---------02:47----------
video on how a DC to DC boost circuit

---------02:49----------
works if you want to know how this works

---------02:50----------
I explain it all in depth because it's

---------02:52----------
probably very confusing

---------02:53----------
long story short pp bus SW LCD backlight

---------02:56----------
per is going to come down here and then

---------02:58----------
that's going to be turned into into 3

---------03:02----------
volts by this 2 point 7 volts something

---------03:04----------
like that by this voltage divider by the

---------03:06----------
way a little little glitch C which says

---------03:09----------
voltage 12 point equals twelve point six

---------03:10----------
this is an error so voltage will

---------03:12----------
actually equal eight point four that's a

---------03:13----------
mistake in the schematic I like catching

---------03:15----------
that it kind of reminds me that even the

---------03:17----------
you know we were kind of working in an

---------03:19----------
industry where all the people who say we

---------03:21----------
shouldn't work on these products say

---------03:22----------
we're not qualified we're unauthorized

---------03:24----------
will make mistakes so stuff like this

---------03:26----------
just kind of reminds me that we're all

---------03:28----------
human and it's a good point here because

---------03:30----------
you know it says even the people

---------03:32----------
designing this are getting the

---------03:33----------
schematics wrong if I were to inject

---------03:34----------
twelve point six volts there I would

---------03:36----------
destroy a good portion of the circuit

---------03:38----------
because the circuit is not meant to

---------03:39----------
handle more than eight point four so

---------03:42----------
it's just it's one of those things it's

---------03:44----------
just kind of you know just not not

---------03:47----------
correct and that's fine it's always okay

---------03:50----------
to not be correct but just don't be one

---------03:51----------
of those holier-than-thou only Apple is

---------03:53----------
allowed to touch this ship because

---------03:54----------
everybody else can't cuz see Apple

---------03:56----------
doesn't know how much voltage is going

---------03:57----------
through their own damn boards twelve

---------04:00----------
point six it's eight point four anyway

---------04:02----------
PP bus SW LCD backlight per so when this

---------04:04----------
transistor opens and allows P P bus g3

---------04:08----------
hot to go through to the boost circuit

---------04:10----------
it's going to have to turn on the enable

---------04:13----------
pin it's gonna have to send voltage the

---------04:14----------
enable pin to view nine 701 now that

---------04:16----------
enable pins expecting like two and a

---------04:17----------
half three and a half volts something

---------04:19----------
around there if I sent eight or 12 volts

---------04:21----------
to it not nice things are going to

---------04:22----------
happen so this little voltage divider is

---------04:24----------
there to to this is there too

---------04:27----------
the voltage of pp bus g3 hot so let's

---------04:29----------
see if we can save the pads here and get

---------04:32----------
this to work so that actually looks like

---------04:34----------
I can I can kind of make a pad out of it

---------04:36----------
again I'm just gonna put the micro iron

---------04:37----------
on instead of the standard sized one

---------04:39----------
because I don't want to I want to wipe

---------04:41----------
off the oxidation but I don't want to

---------04:43----------
destroy the pad and if I use my regular

---------04:45----------
sized iron there's a chance that a pad

---------04:47----------
that is savable might wind up getting

---------04:49----------
destroyed that would be a shame so just

---------04:52----------
turn on the air filter here

---------04:59----------
now right now I'm not I'm not really

---------05:02----------
looking to solder directly to the pad

---------05:04----------
what I'm looking to do is get all the

---------05:06----------
oxidation and the dirt and crap sucked

---------05:08----------
up onto a little solder ball that I run

---------05:10----------
over the pad so there's a big difference

---------05:11----------
because a lot of the people who were

---------05:13----------
involved with let's say IPC

---------05:14----------
certification will say that what I'm

---------05:16----------
doing is wrong here because I'm trying

---------05:17----------
to solder on top of oxidation and you

---------05:19----------
don't understand they will understand

---------05:21----------
what my actual point is here I don't

---------05:22----------
want to put solder on top of oxidation

---------05:24----------
because if you put if you try to solder

---------05:25----------
to oxidation you ruin the joint what I

---------05:27----------
want to do is scratch away the oxidation

---------05:30----------
and also have the oxidation kind of get

---------05:31----------
sucked up into the flux inside our ball

---------05:34----------
that I'm creating so that's that's why

---------05:36----------
I'm going over it repeatedly now the

---------05:41----------
bottom pad is savable and that wasn't

---------05:43----------
really a good view I should have focused

---------05:45----------
a little better before starting maybe a

---------05:47----------
little bit of zoom so the bottom pad is

---------05:49----------
something that's saved the top pad is

---------05:51----------
something that's going to require a wire

---------05:52----------
of some sort because that's that's not

---------05:55----------
really savable that's kind of screwed up

---------06:00----------
yeah that's actually very screwed up

---------06:03----------
really screwed up not gonna

---------06:21----------
it's not

---------06:33----------
all right so what I did there is I just

---------06:35----------
met I got rid of the at insulation stuff

---------06:39----------
all over there all over the the trace

---------06:42----------
I'm gonna put a little wire there and

---------06:44----------
then I'm going to find a resistor of

---------06:46----------
that value and I'm gonna put the

---------06:48----------
resistor of that that value over there

---------06:58----------
I'm just gonna take a here's where I'm

---------07:00----------
getting my jumper wire from by the way

---------07:02----------
this doesn't look familiar this is an a

---------07:04----------
a 1286 battery 2011-2012 so that's just

---------07:10----------
for what the wire on the inside of the

---------07:13----------
battery and and get this over here

---------07:38----------
yes

---------07:51----------
I have nothing holding that in place

---------07:52----------
which is why I'm kind of being careful

---------07:54----------
I'm gonna just put some flux and then

---------07:56----------
have the tweezers hold the wire in place

---------07:58----------
so that I can make a nice joint all

---------08:00----------
around it okay I'll hold the wire in

---------08:05----------
place here and try to hold the wire in

---------08:07----------
place the sad excuse for tweezers

---------08:25----------
nice and flat on the motherboard okay

---------08:28----------
now

---------08:32----------
now it's kind of safe for me to go ahead

---------08:35----------
and get rid of the excess wire

---------08:37----------
oh so we going like this and there we go

---------08:46----------
okay now

---------08:55----------
I have to replace it cap and also the

---------08:59----------
resistor that's gone now that's a very

---------09:00----------
common resistor value this one that I

---------09:02----------
actually really should have in my spool

---------09:03----------
I actually have it in my spool and zero

---------09:06----------
four zero two sides I just don't have

---------09:07----------
any in zero two zero one sighs so you

---------09:10----------
know what that means that means that we

---------09:13----------
begin the scavenging and that's what you

---------09:15----------
hear happening below weird looking

---------09:21----------
through the boards to find one that I

---------09:24----------
haven't stolen those resistors from yet

---------09:28----------
and yeah

---------09:34----------
about finding those two I've I really

---------09:38----------
gotta buy those zero two zero one I have

---------09:41----------
a bunch of zero four zero two because I

---------09:43----------
could cut the zero four zero two ones

---------09:45----------
and a half and use it on my wood

---------10:18----------
that's the sound of me going through a

---------10:20----------
lot of boards that are missing resistors

---------10:25----------
all right here we go all right let's

---------10:30----------
take some let's get the hot air station

---------10:34----------
turned on and ready

---------10:48----------
while we're waiting for this to get hot

---------10:50----------
here

---------11:39----------
wouldn't exactly call that my my best

---------11:43----------
I must even work but yeah it's not like

---------11:50----------
it's not like people send stuff for you

---------11:52----------
because they want everything started on

---------11:53----------
as even as possible I'm pretty sure

---------11:57----------
that's not why any I mean if you watch

---------12:01----------
all of these videos in their entirety

---------12:03----------
and you go through all the channel

---------12:05----------
content and like your goal is to find

---------12:07----------
somebody is gonna put the components on

---------12:09----------
perfectly straight and you send

---------12:11----------
something here anyway I don't know what

---------12:12----------
to say at that point

---------12:21----------
all righty

---------12:26----------
you know I just need to find some way to

---------12:28----------
test this and then I'll be set as this

---------12:32----------
was sent for it only I almost did all

---------12:34----------
that and forgot to replace the LED

---------12:35----------
driver all right so let's take a look at

---------12:37----------
that because that is ice I just showed

---------12:40----------
you what the ball looked like under that

---------12:42----------
and I have no expectation of that being

---------12:43----------
any good let's grab one kick on the air

---------12:54----------
filter

---------13:46----------
you see how nasty this stuff under the

---------13:48----------
this is almost like some solder paste

---------13:51----------
looking a and goo yes gross

---------14:17----------
just try and blow some of that away

---------14:32----------
let's see if you can actually wick with

---------14:33----------
a micro pencil probably one of the

---------14:36----------
dumbest things I've done in the history

---------14:37----------
of this channel let's see can this micro

---------14:42----------
pencil actually wick Pat's yeah

---------14:47----------
buddy can you just freakin for woah I'm

---------14:54----------
impressed okay I'm not gonna say that

---------14:56----------
this is exactly the ideal tool to be

---------14:58----------
doing the job with but you saw what it

---------14:59----------
was able to do just there right

---------15:01----------
staying wikked pads micro pencil the

---------15:09----------
hakko 2032 is a boss again didn't

---------15:13----------
exactly do the most perfect job in the

---------15:16----------
world but that's impressive to me what I

---------15:21----------
was able to do definitely impressed with

---------15:23----------
that okay we put flux and take this chip

---------16:10----------
just take a look at my balls

---------16:17----------
happy with the way my balls look okay

---------16:24----------
let's see if I'm an idiot

---------16:26----------
did I do something right or am I an

---------16:29----------
idiot I shouldn't say it in those terms

---------16:32----------
I can do something right and still be an

---------16:34----------
idiot

---------16:34----------
it's cuz I get something right doesn't

---------16:36----------
mean I'm not an idiot

---------16:37----------
okay let's plug this in this is an old

---------16:42----------
cracked screwed up assembly

---------16:55----------
what do we get

---------17:07----------
yay light I hope you learned something
