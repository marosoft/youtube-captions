---------00:00----------
ok today we're going to be going over a

---------00:01----------
machine that does not turn on you have

---------00:04----------
no light on the charger this is with a

---------00:06----------
known good DC and board and known good

---------00:08----------
BC and buoyed cable so we're going to go

---------00:10----------
over why that is so the first thing that

---------00:12----------
you should check is the one wire circuit

---------00:14----------
I've gone over this in previous videos

---------00:15----------
but I'm going to go over it in this one

---------00:17----------
as well because yeah might as well makes

---------00:20----------
it easy touchdown so if I were to flip

---------00:22----------
over to the screen capture reason I'm

---------00:25----------
really talking really low today is

---------00:27----------
because I got this I got my earwax

---------00:29----------
removed and I was supposed to do that

---------00:30----------
about four years ago and now everything

---------00:32----------
is just incredibly loud all the time

---------00:35----------
it's driving me crazy so I'm talking

---------00:37----------
very low because I don't I hear the

---------00:42----------
esses and everything I can hear the air

---------00:44----------
moving inside like usually you could

---------00:45----------
hear the air conditioner but I can

---------00:46----------
actually hear the air moving inside of

---------00:48----------
that ducted sights the things that I can

---------00:50----------
hear right now just amazing so anyway

---------00:52----------
the way the one wire circuit works is

---------00:54----------
very simple you have this adapter sends

---------00:56----------
line that's coming from the charger and

---------00:58----------
that's going to go to this chip over

---------01:00----------
here this chip is going to allow the

---------01:01----------
adapter sense line from the charger

---------01:03----------
which is where the charger talks to talk

---------01:05----------
to the SMC see this is the SMC over here

---------01:08----------
and this is on this sis one wire line

---------01:10----------
now this chip is going to turn on and

---------01:12----------
let them talk if it has three point four

---------01:14----------
volts at the VCC pin the VCC pin is kind

---------01:16----------
of like the power pin for example with

---------01:18----------
my microscope camera it has this little

---------01:19----------
5 volt plug that turns it on this is the

---------01:22----------
VCC pin of my microscope camera so back

---------01:27----------
here that's this logic gate is going to

---------01:32----------
let this turn on if SMC BCA clk is

---------01:35----------
presence of SMC bc AC ok is present and

---------01:37----------
pp 3 v 4 to underscore g3 hotter present

---------01:40----------
then this logic gate is supposed to send

---------01:42----------
3 volts over to this now it makes the

---------01:43----------
air a little more confusing is that the

---------01:45----------
one wire circuit on the MacBook Air is

---------01:47----------
not on the motherboard it's on the DCN

---------01:49----------
board and it looks very very similar to

---------01:51----------
what it looked like in some of the older

---------01:54----------
models so let me just take a look over

---------01:57----------
here and get it into the microscope for

---------01:59----------
you so that you can see it there we go

---------02:02----------
so that is the one wire circuit see it's

---------02:06----------
all pretty that is the one wire circuit

---------02:09----------
so what I'm going to do over here is I'm

---------02:11----------
just going to check and see that SN

---------02:13----------
CBC a/c ok is present and also that PP

---------02:15----------
3v for two are present on this

---------02:17----------
motherboard so I'm going to go back go

---------02:19----------
over to the screen capture over here

---------02:20----------
we're going to check use the Nets

---------02:22----------
feature of this program sm c bc AC ok

---------02:26----------
and we're going to look for it and let's

---------02:29----------
see what i can measure it so i can

---------02:31----------
measure it on the third resistor down

---------02:32----------
over here so we're going to find on the

---------02:34----------
model board and let's see what I have

---------02:37----------
over here

---------02:54----------
but I measure I see 3.3 volts on the

---------02:57----------
multimeter let's see if you can even see

---------02:59----------
that can you see them up there you can't

---------03:01----------
oh well it isn't the trust me that is

---------03:03----------
3.3 volts and in order for that to be

---------03:05----------
3.3 volts as a P P 3 B 4 2 as to be

---------03:07----------
present because P P 3 B 4 2 is the power

---------03:09----------
line that is pulling up the SMC BC AC

---------03:12----------
okay signal so what do we do next now if

---------03:15----------
that's working that means that this IC

---------03:17----------
is most likely getting power over here

---------03:19----------
this u 6900 is the N I am using a known

---------03:22----------
good DC n board so I don't worry about

---------03:24----------
that and what could book could be next

---------03:27----------
well the SMC let's check let's check

---------03:30----------
over here so what's going to turn on the

---------03:32----------
SMC so we're going to look at the SMC

---------03:34----------
chip SMC SMC what turns on the SMC is

---------03:40----------
going to be something called SMC

---------03:41----------
underscore reset underscore L now the

---------03:44----------
way this works is this chip is how do I

---------03:47----------
describe it I'd say it's kind of like a

---------03:49----------
brown out Brown out detector so the

---------03:51----------
whole idea here is pp 3 V 4 to powers

---------03:53----------
the SMC that is the rail that powers the

---------03:54----------
SMC however it takes about a little bit

---------03:58----------
of time for that rail to become exactly

---------04:00----------
3.42 volts if the SMC attempts to start

---------04:03----------
before that rail becomes the exact 3.42

---------04:07----------
volts supposed to be the SMC will crash

---------04:09----------
should stop working audacity things will

---------04:11----------
happen so what happens is that this chip

---------04:13----------
waits until PP 3 before to underscore G

---------04:15----------
3 hot is stable and then it releases the

---------04:17----------
SMC reset signal which will then let the

---------04:19----------
SMC turn on by release I mean that it

---------04:21----------
goes high

---------04:22----------
so SMC underscore reset underscore L

---------04:25----------
this means reset the SMC when the signal

---------04:28----------
is low so when that signal is low like

---------04:30----------
0.5 volts or zero volts the SMC is in

---------04:32----------
reset mode which is kinda like a stop

---------04:34----------
computer we have a desktop computer and

---------04:36----------
you try holding down the reset button

---------04:37----------
when you hold down the reset button

---------04:39----------
you'll notice that the machine even

---------04:42----------
though it's on is not doing anything so

---------04:44----------
try this if you have an old desktop

---------04:45----------
because I know a lot of new machines

---------04:46----------
don't even have a reset button anymore

---------04:48----------
if you just hold the reset button then

---------04:49----------
you keep it pressed for like 10 seconds

---------04:51----------
the machine the screen goes black

---------04:53----------
doesn't pose doesn't beep it's on the

---------04:55----------
fans are spinning but it's not doing

---------04:57----------
anything

---------04:58----------
same thing on is present over here so

---------05:00----------
the way this is going to work it's going

---------05:02----------
to reset the SMC now there are a couple

---------05:05----------
of ways that SMC reset L can be low

---------05:08----------
this trip can be dead if this chip is

---------05:09----------
dead it will lower this by you know

---------05:12----------
let's say this chip dies ground and

---------05:14----------
reset will become tied together inside

---------05:16----------
the chip SMC manual reset underscore L

---------05:19----------
the manual reset could be triggered by

---------05:23----------
lowering this remember underscore L

---------05:25----------
means when the signal is low if this

---------05:28----------
capacitor breaks which happens very

---------05:30----------
often with by with people's fingernails

---------05:31----------
or when a capacitor dies it often turns

---------05:34----------
itself into a wire so this what this is

---------05:37----------
your capacitor now when it gets damaged

---------05:40----------
it turns into something like this so now

---------05:44----------
over here you have something that is not

---------05:46----------
going to pass DC it's going to go and

---------05:49----------
fail right here you have something that

---------05:50----------
will pass DC just fine so when a

---------05:53----------
capacitor fails it often shorts and if

---------05:56----------
this shorts that can happen so let's

---------05:58----------
take a little look at what's going on in

---------06:00----------
this area so if I take a look at SMC

---------06:02----------
manual reset but I actually have

---------06:06----------
memorized where the is on the board

---------06:07----------
at this point because I've checked so

---------06:09----------
many damn times let's see if okay we do

---------06:15----------
this two point seven that's good and

---------06:18----------
then we check over here and SMC as we

---------06:22----------
would which pen am I even checking my

---------06:24----------
checking the right pin let's see what

---------06:27----------
does the boy you say board view says

---------06:30----------
okay so SMC manual reset is up here and

---------06:34----------
that is two point seven and then SMC

---------06:37----------
reset is up there okay I was checking

---------06:39----------
the wrong one so SMC manual reset is

---------06:42----------
high that's good but SMC reset is 0.5

---------06:45----------
volts and there are a couple of things

---------06:46----------
that could be causing that to be low SMC

---------06:50----------
reset L can be low because this chip is

---------06:54----------
bad or it could be low because the SMC

---------06:56----------
itself is bad and then pulling the

---------06:58----------
signal down so if you look at the

---------06:59----------
pathways that SMC reset Allies to ground

---------07:01----------
actually there's a couple of different

---------07:03----------
things

---------07:03----------
this signal is pulled up by P P 3 V 4 2

---------07:05----------
by this with this resistance so this

---------07:07----------
resistor over here is going to pull SMC

---------07:09----------
reset L up to 3 point 42 volts so I

---------07:12----------
could always check our 5100 and let's

---------07:16----------
just see which one over here's our if if

---------07:17----------
our 5100 is on the other side of the

---------07:20----------
board go figure

---------07:21----------
of course is and so our 5100 is here I

---------07:24----------
can measure this I can make sure that

---------07:25----------
this voltage present over there but

---------07:29----------
there's always present wealth is present

---------07:30----------
over there that's never the issue the

---------07:31----------
pull-up resistor is almost never the

---------07:33----------
issue in my experience so we're going to

---------07:35----------
just what we're just going to check it

---------07:36----------
just for thoroughness so I get three

---------07:40----------
point four volts there and I get point

---------07:43----------
five volts there and the resistance of

---------07:46----------
that pull-up resistor let's see what do

---------07:49----------
you get me fifty one two three kilohms

---------07:58----------
good enough I'm not looking a lot of

---------08:00----------
people say you know why are you why are

---------08:01----------
you measuring the resistance of a

---------08:03----------
capacitor resistor and circuit it's not

---------08:04----------
gonna be accurate I don't care I need to

---------08:06----------
be good enough if that resistor shows me

---------08:09----------
o L or millions of ohms bad if it shows

---------08:13----------
me a hundred kilo ohms or under fifty

---------08:15----------
it's fine because I want you to think

---------08:17----------
about this if this resistor over here

---------08:19----------
are 50 100 or 50 kilo ohms instead of

---------08:21----------
100 why would that matter I should still

---------08:24----------
see if anything if it's 50 kilohms there

---------08:26----------
should be a higher chance of me seeing

---------08:27----------
voltage over here than 100 so I don't

---------08:29----------
really care as long as it's in the

---------08:31----------
ballpark and I know what the circuit is

---------08:33----------
supposed to be doing I'm fine so I know

---------08:36----------
that the purpose of this resistor is to

---------08:37----------
pull the signal up so the chip could

---------08:39----------
give it a path to ground or whatever

---------08:41----------
else is on that line so this chip could

---------08:43----------
be giving it a path to ground this

---------08:46----------
connector could be screwed up and giving

---------08:48----------
it a path to ground you'd ever know

---------08:51----------
let's take a look at what the connector

---------08:53----------
looks like so Jay 6100 is this thing

---------08:57----------
over here

---------08:57----------
believe it or not that that connector

---------09:00----------
gets screwed up more often than you can

---------09:01----------
think and it looks like I've already

---------09:03----------
taken it off because I'm used to that

---------09:04----------
connector screwing things up so the

---------09:06----------
connector is not even that's your way we

---------09:08----------
have two points over here that look

---------09:09----------
bridged I take this offer oh so you have

---------09:14----------
two points over here that look bridged

---------09:15----------
and the points that look bridged but

---------09:18----------
I'll be damned those points that look

---------09:20----------
bridged off for smc reset do you see

---------09:23----------
that check that out do you see that I'll

---------09:26----------
keep zooming just in case you can't see

---------09:27----------
that look at that whoa okay

---------09:31----------
am I going to fix this board

---------09:34----------
by pressing my soldering iron to the

---------09:36----------
table okay let's take a look here am I

---------09:40----------
going to fix my boil just take a look

---------09:42----------
see SMC reset is this pin pin 12 and

---------09:44----------
then spi something-or-other is there so

---------09:49----------
let's let's take a look well is this

---------09:51----------
what the thing was all along because I

---------09:54----------
usually remove that connector and I and

---------09:58----------
I go over it now I am going to plug it

---------10:03----------
in and my if this turns on this would be

---------10:12----------
okay so it's it's it's not turning on

---------10:14----------
but I got a light you see that I don't

---------10:19----------
have a light before okay so problem

---------10:22----------
number one solved I don't know if I turn

---------10:24----------
this off they took this off because I

---------10:25----------
have a feeling that if I took that

---------10:27----------
connector off that there would be flux

---------10:29----------
all over the place because I don't

---------10:31----------
ultrasonic these boards until I'm done

---------10:33----------
with them now so I don't I want to say

---------10:36----------
that I did that but I don't feel like I

---------10:38----------
did either way we have a green light

---------10:40----------
that that's pretty cool alright so we

---------10:42----------
have a green light so now we have to

---------10:43----------
move on to why the fan doesn't spin so

---------10:46----------
we're going to go and check the rest of

---------10:48----------
the rails on this machine now what does

---------10:51----------
spi alt io3 hold el whatever go to so

---------10:56----------
let's let's check this out because keep

---------10:58----------
in mind that something was trying to

---------10:59----------
supply three point four volts directly

---------11:01----------
to what that is so that's pin ten of

---------11:04----------
this connector pin ten of this connector

---------11:06----------
is this so where does this go spi all

---------11:13----------
told that's going to go to SPI i/o three

---------11:16----------
are at i/o which is going to go here and

---------11:22----------
that is going to go directly to the CPU

---------11:29----------
oh I understand a curiosity what is that

---------11:36----------
usually what is that what is that

---------11:38----------
usually measured tell what voltage is

---------11:41----------
that use the seen oh Jesus Oh

---------11:46----------
it's okay that is three point three okay

---------11:48----------
so I don't think sending three point

---------11:50----------
three there would particularly do

---------11:51----------
anything the reason I don't think it

---------11:53----------
would do anything is because it's three

---------11:56----------
point three already okay so this kind of

---------11:59----------
brings us to a standstill let's check

---------12:04----------
around the BIOS chip because that's the

---------12:06----------
only hints that I have at the moment

---------12:07----------
that anything was going on so that SPI

---------12:11----------
me so SPI mole CSPI clock and all this

---------12:14----------
crap over here this is this is usually

---------12:16----------
related to the SPI ROM at all so you I

---------12:19----------
guess if you're if you use the dealing

---------12:20----------
with pcs the BIOS chip so let's take a

---------12:23----------
look around you 6100 over here so if we

---------12:25----------
look at you 6100 we look over here and

---------12:30----------
this is the BIOS chip or SPI wrong chip

---------12:34----------
because SPI

---------12:35----------
I don't know SPI Ramdas sounds

---------12:37----------
pretentious to me for some reason I know

---------12:39----------
it's silly to say that out loud but it

---------12:41----------
just does so if you look at the SPI ROM

---------12:43----------
chip what do you think here should we

---------12:45----------
reflash the BIOS should wery flash the

---------12:49----------
BIOS should wery flash the BIOS does

---------12:54----------
anybody have a clean BIOS okay I the

---------12:58----------
reason I'm saying that over and over

---------12:59----------
again for those of you who are not

---------13:00----------
regulars of the channel is because there

---------13:02----------
are many many many many many many many

---------13:04----------
forums out there where people will just

---------13:06----------
jump to flashing BIOS and asking for a

---------13:10----------
BIOS if they have anything related to a

---------13:11----------
BIOS problem rather than actually look I

---------13:14----------
mean SPI wrong they will look for the

---------13:17----------
SPI ROM if they suspect they have an SPI

---------13:21----------
ROM problem where this is we're looking

---------13:24----------
really comes in handy what the is

---------13:27----------
this what you get off my board all

---------13:32----------
that can GTFO so i don't know what

---------13:35----------
that's for i'm going to take a wild

---------13:36----------
guess that is a terminator and resistor

---------13:38----------
between the bios and the CPU or the bios

---------13:40----------
and something else I mean the SPI wrong

---------13:45----------
how dare you call it a BIOS that is not

---------13:48----------
a PC it is an SPI ROM I guess this is

---------13:52----------
what they're talking about when the

---------13:53----------
Apple lobbyists say that I'm turning a

---------13:54----------
Mac into a PC because I'm putting a BIOS

---------13:57----------
on it when it's supposed to be

---------14:00----------
Espie I'm wrong the lobbyists are right

---------14:03----------
men

---------14:04----------
I really do turn Macs and PCs I do turn

---------14:07----------
max into pcs when I fix them and then I

---------14:10----------
misrepresent them to my customers I'm an

---------14:15----------
 I'm a grade-a

---------14:23----------
yeah I'm not touching that vials

---------14:25----------
that cleaning Emmy region no thank you

---------14:30----------
making any regions no thank you that's a

---------14:34----------
lot of pain in the ass that I don't feel

---------14:37----------
like doing and if I'm gonna fix it

---------14:38----------
that's the thing you could do all that

---------14:40----------
 and you're not even going to

---------14:42----------
 fix it was the problem with

---------14:45----------
something else and all you had to do is

---------14:48----------
open your eyes and look at it just look

---------14:52----------
at it if I get anything done with this

---------14:55----------
channel if I get anything done at all I

---------14:57----------
want you to look at just look at it

---------15:00----------
and guess sometimes I have students

---------15:03----------
coming I'll go what do you think this

---------15:04----------
does no go I don't know and I go guess

---------15:06----------
and they go I can't guess what do you

---------15:08----------
mean you can't guess you can always

---------15:11----------
guess you can always get a guess wrong

---------15:15----------
but don't tell me you can guess and I'll

---------15:18----------
tell them there is no consequence to

---------15:20----------
getting the answer to this question

---------15:20----------
wrong the only negative consequence will

---------15:25----------
occur if you can't guess I need to know

---------15:29----------
that when you look at something that you

---------15:31----------
have the ability to come up with

---------15:32----------
educated guesses jumping to conclusions

---------15:36----------
is what this is all based on

---------15:44----------
and I'm jumping to the conclusion that

---------15:46----------
this is going to work just fine

---------15:48----------
once I'm done with everything that I'm

---------15:50----------
doing here

---------16:09----------
now keep in mind I'm not going above and

---------16:11----------
beyond to make each joint very pretty

---------16:13----------
all I did is I made the and just put

---------16:16----------
solder on each pad using the old flux to

---------16:18----------
keep stuff sticking around and then when

---------16:21----------
I'm close to done what I'm going to do

---------16:23----------
is I'm going to melt them all in nicely

---------16:24----------
the thing is I don't want to spend too

---------16:26----------
much time with hot air on each

---------16:28----------
individual component because since these

---------16:29----------
components are so close together since

---------16:32----------
the components are so close together I'm

---------16:34----------
going to be hot airing each one each

---------16:35----------
time I do this so what I want to do is

---------16:43----------
do one hot air at the end with flux to

---------16:46----------
flow them all into place

---------16:53----------
this is why the donor Boyd thing is

---------16:55----------
amazing you get these factory reject

---------17:01----------
donor boards that had never had liquid

---------17:03----------
damage they had a bad CPU or a bad

---------17:05----------
internal view or something like that it

---------17:08----------
makes everything just so efficient okay

---------17:14----------
this

---------17:21----------
watch all those resistors watch

---------17:35----------
okay BAM they're in place a little

---------17:39----------
crooked but what are you gonna do I look

---------17:42----------
at this boy the stuff on this this donor

---------17:44----------
board is perfect if you're like how dare

---------17:46----------
you take a resistor off of a donor boy

---------17:48----------
how did this it's beautiful this is

---------17:51----------
beautiful this is a lovely board to take

---------17:53----------
stuff off and like am I gonna take that

---------17:55----------
know that maybe not but you know

---------18:00----------
probably going to avoid this area you

---------18:04----------
know for but there are really excellent

---------18:08----------
and efficient way to troubleshoot these

---------18:10----------
things so now I'm going to plug this in

---------18:15----------
I'm going to wait for my Fanus bin

---------18:23----------
my fan don't want to spin all right so

---------18:29----------
let's keep keep chasing down the path

---------18:32----------
that we were on

---------18:39----------
so I put a lot of things back in this

---------18:40----------
general area I don't want to go too far

---------18:43----------
off the reservation because I genuinely

---------18:45----------
feel like this is the area the liquid

---------18:47----------
got to and this is where my trouble is

---------18:48----------
going to be so what are you mr. resistor

---------18:54----------
with your white cap ripped off

---------19:01----------
let's also take a moment to check out

---------19:02----------
what power rails are actually present

---------19:05----------
before I go resistor hunting

---------19:19----------
so I'm going to fast forward and see if

---------19:22----------
I'm in an Esso state so I'm going to

---------19:24----------
plug this in because they keep in mind

---------19:26----------
if I'm in an Esso state then I know I

---------19:28----------
can ignore all the s3 and s4 and hundred

---------19:30----------
power rails I'm going to take my

---------19:32----------
multimeter here and try to put it where

---------19:33----------
you can see it which is it's not going

---------19:39----------
to work but I'll just read out the

---------19:41----------
voltages as I go we're going to go to

---------19:45----------
page 61 on the schematic okay so let's

---------19:50----------
see where PP v V s Oh shows up I know

---------19:54----------
it's on the fan connector but I always

---------19:55----------
forget which pin of the damn fan here

---------19:59----------
you go okay so let's see if that's there

---------20:02----------
then I know that I'm getting somewhere

---------20:04----------
so

---------20:16----------
I have pp5 ESO so I'm actually in an

---------20:19----------
Esso state right now now let me explain

---------20:21----------
why that's important me explain why this

---------20:23----------
is something that edge that should be at

---------20:25----------
you in troubleshooting now there are

---------20:27----------
different power states in the machine

---------20:29----------
there's s0 which is on there's s3 which

---------20:32----------
I believe is sleeping there's s4 which I

---------20:34----------
believe is hibernating

---------20:35----------
there's s5 which I think I think is off

---------20:38----------
the battery plugged in you should double

---------20:41----------
check those because I could be wrong

---------20:42----------
so please google and figure out what

---------20:44----------
those mean for yourself but an

---------20:45----------
overgeneralization

---------20:47----------
Esso is on s3 is sleeping as far as

---------20:51----------
hibernate and s5 should be off now in

---------20:54----------
order to get to the next state you have

---------20:57----------
to get all the power where else in the

---------20:58----------
previous state so for example s5 is off

---------21:00----------
all the power rails that are supposed to

---------21:02----------
be present when the computer is off and

---------21:03----------
s5 have to be present for it to

---------21:05----------
hibernate all the power rails present

---------21:07----------
for to hibernate have to be present for

---------21:09----------
to sleep all the power rails present

---------21:11----------
when it's sleep have to be present for

---------21:12----------
to be on make sense so for example an s3

---------21:15----------
power line may be aligned for the memory

---------21:18----------
because the memory has to be on when

---------21:20----------
it's sleeping because when you close the

---------21:21----------
lid and you choose to go to sleep that's

---------21:23----------
where it's going to store all your open

---------21:24----------
applications in RAM if you hibernate

---------21:27----------
again I'm going outside of what I know

---------21:29----------
about here I believe when you hibernate

---------21:30----------
that it sends everything over to the

---------21:32----------
hard drive or the solid-state drive

---------21:33----------
rather than keeping it in memory so

---------21:35----------
hibernate I believe is where the RAM is

---------21:36----------
even going to get turned off so and the

---------21:39----------
s/o rails are rails like CPU and rails

---------21:43----------
like back light you don't need the

---------21:45----------
backlight to be on when the computer is

---------21:48----------
sleeping so that's an Esso rail you

---------21:49----------
don't need two CPU to be on when the

---------21:51----------
computer is hibernating that's why the

---------21:52----------
CPU power is going to or the fan is that

---------21:55----------
is all on the Esso rails so when you

---------21:57----------
look at a list like this of all the

---------21:58----------
different rails you're going to see a

---------22:02----------
list of rails there we go so we have G 3

---------22:11----------
hot a G 3 hot rail means it should be

---------22:13----------
there all the time so PP bus should be

---------22:15----------
there all the time

---------22:17----------
PP DC in the DC n rail should be there

---------22:19----------
all the time if we continue scrolling

---------22:22----------
down here are the RTC rail should be

---------22:24----------
there all the time

---------22:25----------
PP 5vs5 should be there when it's off as

---------22:28----------
for when it's hibernating

---------22:30----------
as oh when it's on so if even one of

---------22:33----------
these rails one of these SL rails is

---------22:35----------
present what that tells me is that I can

---------22:37----------
ignore checking every single s 5 s 3 and

---------22:40----------
s 4 rail so all these things that say s

---------22:42----------
3 s 3 s 5 I can ignore those and just

---------22:47----------
focus on the s oh so it's it's a quick

---------22:49----------
fit of process of elimination once I see

---------22:51----------
that the s oh rails are the rails that

---------22:53----------
are once I see the SL rails of the are

---------22:56----------
present even one of them is present I

---------22:58----------
know that I now don't have to check the

---------23:00----------
S 4 to the or the s 3s or any of those

---------23:03----------
and it saves me a lot of time so now I

---------23:04----------
can focus on which s o is going to be

---------23:06----------
missing and again I can also now

---------23:09----------
continue with my context so now I've put

---------23:11----------
this into context I know what's going on

---------23:14----------
with it I know that there was probably

---------23:16----------
liquid over here somebody watched the

---------23:19----------
video that I did on on removing the

---------23:22----------
connector to fix the board because I did

---------23:24----------
do a video on that a while ago but they

---------23:26----------
left a little bit of solder there now

---------23:27----------
even though this section of the board

---------23:29----------
looks clean it looks like it was

---------23:30----------
soldered over by somebody even though

---------23:32----------
that section is clean now I know that

---------23:34----------
that's my hints that water went there so

---------23:36----------
now I'm a detective and then when I saw

---------23:38----------
when I thought to myself okay water went

---------23:40----------
there that's how I knew to replace these

---------23:41----------
termination resistors by the BIOS I mean

---------23:43----------
the SPI wrong chip for those of you who

---------23:46----------
will get angry at me and now I know that

---------23:49----------
water went there so now that I know

---------23:50----------
water went here and I did that nothing

---------23:52----------
is working what do I do next what is

---------23:55----------
next right under it because this is the

---------23:58----------
area right under it again me when you

---------24:00----------
when you're when you're on the trail

---------24:01----------
when the detective is on the trail he

---------24:02----------
doesn't like oh ha I'm finding it aha

---------24:05----------
I'm getting somewhere yes yes and then

---------24:07----------
when he's out of hinge just decided to

---------24:09----------
go all the way back here no he stops on

---------24:11----------
the trail where whatever step is in and

---------24:12----------
then Wally's over here he's like hmm

---------24:15----------
dust for fingerprints look around what's

---------24:18----------
going on

---------24:19----------
do I hear anything they don't just go

---------24:21----------
all the way back to the bottom they

---------24:23----------
continue investigating where they were

---------24:24----------
and that's the exact same thing that

---------24:26----------
we're going to do here now we look over

---------24:28----------
here this looks like see this over

---------24:30----------
here see when you can see the white end

---------24:32----------
of a resistor when you can see that

---------24:34----------
white stuff you're screwed so for

---------24:36----------
example if I want to point out something

---------24:38----------
that looks like the way it's supposed to

---------24:39----------
let's take let's take this

---------24:44----------
right here you can still see that it as

---------24:45----------
these metal ends you see the metal ends

---------24:47----------
and by the way if you guys wonder why I

---------24:48----------
don't buy the articulating microscope

---------24:50----------
stand do you see how steady that is even

---------24:52----------
if I start moving around a lot when you

---------24:55----------
have the articulating stand you can't

---------24:57----------
really move around or even just look

---------24:59----------
into it because it's constantly shaking

---------25:00----------
so the reason I like this is this boom

---------25:02----------
stand that I have is because it's very

---------25:04----------
very sturdy even if it means I have to

---------25:06----------
it's a pain in the ass to move around

---------25:07----------
yeah so that's a good one you can

---------25:10----------
clearly see the ends of the component

---------25:12----------
whereas here you don't it looks like

---------25:15----------
balls this is just balls so let's take a

---------25:19----------
look at that because when I say it looks

---------25:20----------
like balls what I'm talking about

---------25:22----------
is this is not no longer than metal nd I

---------25:25----------
can see this like white styrofoam ish

---------25:27----------
looking substance and I can you when you

---------25:30----------
scratch at it it just doesn't feel like

---------25:31----------
metal anymore now when I look at the

---------25:34----------
board view software if I look at the

---------25:37----------
board view software and I click on it

---------25:41----------
it's going to say that this is our seven

---------25:45----------
four to five so let's look up our seven

---------25:47----------
four to five and our seven four to five

---------25:50----------
is supposed to be a zero ohm resister

---------25:52----------
that it's this is part of a resistor

---------25:55----------
capacitor that is going to AH here we go

---------26:03----------
so this line going out here so this is

---------26:06----------
supposed to be one point two volts for

---------26:08----------
an s3 rail that's interesting that's

---------26:11----------
interesting that that's an s3 rail

---------26:12----------
because as I said I should be getting

---------26:15----------
the s3 rails if I'm already in Essos Oh

---------26:18----------
something interesting is going on here

---------26:20----------
something very interesting is going on

---------26:23----------
here so let's see let's find that signal

---------26:31----------
okay so that is going to power Ram do a

---------26:37----------
let's just find that component okay

---------26:40----------
r7 450 are 7450 I'll be able to measure

---------26:44----------
that in our 7450 r7 450 now if I go to

---------26:49----------
our 70 450 which is going to be right by

---------26:51----------
the solid state drive I should be able

---------26:54----------
to measure that 1.2 volts let's take a

---------26:59----------
look at that in the microscope that

---------27:00----------
doesn't look too terrible so I'm going

---------27:01----------
to plug this in and see if I get 1.2

---------27:03----------
volts there and if I do that'll mean

---------27:06----------
that my trail is starting to go cold so

---------27:08----------
I'm hoping that I don't get 1.2 volts I

---------27:10----------
just plugged everything in and I'm

---------27:12----------
getting zero volts there so that's

---------27:14----------
really interesting what interests me is

---------27:17----------
that I was able to get 5 volts on an

---------27:20----------
Esso rail but I'm getting nothing on

---------27:22----------
this one that's that's really really

---------27:24----------
interesting because I've never seen a

---------27:26----------
case in the past where I had an s3 rail

---------27:28----------
without having an soo one I mean it's

---------27:32----------
obvious why for the for the usual rail

---------27:34----------
so for example you know like pp5 es 3

---------27:37----------
literally becomes PP v vs l so that zero

---------27:40----------
ohm resistor is giving me an open line

---------27:42----------
here so that's your own mister is

---------27:43----------
destroyed so in the case of a standard

---------27:46----------
rail like p that's the power fat page 58

---------27:51----------
here we go yes so for example PP 3 V 3 s

---------27:57----------
5 becomes PP 3 V 3 S 4 PP so I pp 3 V 3

---------28:02----------
s 5 also becomes pp 3 V 3 s 3 so I'm not

---------28:06----------
really used to one being present without

---------28:08----------
the other I guess here you could

---------28:12----------
actually technically get to an S o

---------28:14----------
without even being an S 3 can you even

---------28:17----------
have them scattered skids getting kind

---------28:19----------
of confusing I guess that there is no

---------28:21----------
I'm guessing that there is no power good

---------28:24----------
signal I don't think there is a power

---------28:28----------
good signal that ensures that this is

---------28:30----------
present before you go to SL maybe that's

---------28:33----------
been taken away because usually if

---------28:35----------
you're not in an s3 state you really

---------28:37----------
can't if you all your s 3s are not

---------28:38----------
present than the older machines you're

---------28:40----------
not getting to a so I guess the newer

---------28:42----------
MacBook Air is designed a little bit

---------28:43----------
differently they don't really care they

---------28:44----------
figure if you're in an Esso state before

---------28:46----------
you've gotten s 3 that your computer is

---------28:48----------
 and it doesn't really matter for

---------28:49----------
power saving reasons anyway because they

---------28:51----------
know that that circuitry is only going

---------28:53----------
to save your computer power if it's

---------28:55----------
totally destroyed in which case power

---------28:57----------
savings is probably not important you

---------28:59----------
anyway let's stop blabbering and get on

---------29:01----------
to replacing that little resistor that's

---------29:03----------
really really sucks because I

---------29:04----------
used to like that method of

---------29:05----------
troubleshooting that sucks

---------29:08----------
I mean I know what's wrong with the

---------29:10----------
board now but still doesn't take away

---------29:11----------
the fact that that sucks so there's

---------29:15----------
nothing on here to chit that signal is

---------29:17----------
not part of any P good circuit lame lame

---------29:23----------
lame lame lame lame I mean I know it's

---------29:27----------
going to work now but still lame doesn't

---------29:31----------
matter how much you think you know this

---------29:33----------
 is always changing so I saw

---------29:36----------
something that looked really nasty there

---------29:38----------
which is why I did that

---------29:39----------
and now

---------29:45----------
and get all the lead-free solder sucked

---------29:47----------
up into my solder ball my favorite

---------29:53----------
goodbye lead-free okay now to place my

---------30:00----------
resistor

---------30:43----------
yeah

---------30:45----------
drat okay how much more treachery will

---------30:50----------
this board give me all right so we're

---------30:51----------
going to continue on the centrum ember

---------30:53----------
what I said the good detective is going

---------30:54----------
to look around so what do I get on that

---------30:56----------
power rail now I still got zero okay so

---------31:00----------
what's going on so now I'm still gonna

---------31:02----------
look in this area I'm still on the scent

---------31:05----------
I'm on the scent I'm gonna stay over

---------31:09----------
here stay in this area my problem is

---------31:12----------
still probably related to something in

---------31:14----------
that area turn off the air filter

---------31:16----------
because after I got my earwax remove

---------31:18----------
that thing is going to make me deaf okay

---------31:23----------
so we've we've already kind of fixed the

---------31:25----------
things that looked nasty now in this

---------31:31----------
little more that looks nasty okay so

---------31:34----------
let's see V

---------31:45----------
are we getting voltage into this I see

---------31:49----------
so I should have pp 5vs5 at pin 12

---------31:54----------
so let's look up where pin 12 is going

---------31:56----------
to be

---------32:05----------
pin 12 is going to be where am i ah here

---------32:13----------
we are

---------32:14----------
and 12 is you so I should have 5 volts

---------32:20----------
at pin 12 which I do even though that

---------32:29----------
looks kind of like balls right over here

---------32:33----------
okay now I need to see what I have on

---------32:37----------
pin 17 and 16 those are the enables if I

---------32:41----------
don't have voltage on if I don't have

---------32:44----------
voltage on the enables this will be

---------32:45----------
painful and somehow it decided to turn

---------32:50----------
itself on I think me scratching actually

---------32:54----------
did something I don't know if you saw

---------32:57----------
that or not because I was on the camera

---------32:59----------
but I started scratching at this thing

---------33:00----------
and it turned on so what I'm going to do

---------33:03----------
now is I'm just going to scratch the

---------33:06----------
rest of it

---------33:17----------
don't argue with what works make a nice

---------33:21----------
new nice looking connection there deck

---------33:24----------
this cap looks like so that's

---------33:26----------
just got to go see do I have the

---------33:30----------
patience to wait for the hot air to turn

---------33:31----------
on or am I going to try to turn it off

---------33:33----------
with my son to get out my soldering iron

---------33:37----------
yeah we got I don't want the patience

---------33:39----------
for the way for the hot air and I'll

---------33:42----------
take this one too that looks nasty as

---------33:44----------
hell

---------33:51----------
right

---------33:59----------
you like

---------34:11----------
okay now we a little bit of cleanup

---------34:27----------
we're back to factory

---------35:08----------
you people with really good hands are

---------35:11----------
probably laughing at me

---------35:19----------
good enough

---------35:35----------
yeah this is the thought that looks like

---------35:37----------
 I'm not going to trust this stay

---------35:44----------
together so what can we do here and I

---------35:47----------
say it looks like I mean the path

---------35:48----------
where 5 volts is going to come to the

---------35:50----------
chip um now

---------35:59----------
I don't feel like having this come back

---------36:01----------
for warranty a day after I give it back

---------36:03----------
to the customer okay so we go like this

---------36:10----------
it's going to tend the end of the wire a

---------36:12----------
little bit

---------36:37----------
this is no fun when you're me okay get

---------36:42----------
the tiny iron on

---------36:56----------
beep you schmuck

---------36:59----------
this

---------37:03----------
and Jai offer this

---------37:27----------
okay now down here

---------37:32----------
okay much better

---------37:35----------
this is something I can actually trust

---------37:37----------
the last and not just fall apart

---------37:48----------
and yeah good mission that's a good

---------37:51----------
that's a good good strong wire there now

---------38:14----------
look at that fan spin it's beautiful so

---------38:23----------
that's that another board working and as

---------38:25----------
always with these videos I hope you

---------38:27----------
learn something
