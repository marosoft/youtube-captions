---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're gonna be getting started fixing in

---------00:02----------
a 1708 non-touch bar 2016-17 MacBook Pro

---------00:08----------
let's open this thing up figure out why

---------00:10----------
it's not powering on and see if we can

---------00:11----------
make it work again alright so it looks

---------00:16----------
like this takes 5 volts 260 million but

---------00:19----------
doesn't seem to want to get up to 20

---------00:21----------
volts let's take the board out of the

---------00:22----------
case and try and figure out why that is

---------00:24----------
now on the older Mac books there is the

---------00:27----------
such thing as you having a green orange

---------00:28----------
light in the charger charges turning on

---------00:30----------
or no light in the charger charger not

---------00:32----------
turning on the reason I plugged this USB

---------00:33----------
C amp meter in between the charger and

---------00:35----------
the board is same general principle 5

---------00:37----------
volts charge is not turning on 20 volts

---------00:40----------
it is turning on don't forget personal

---------00:50----------
space circles

---------00:50----------
what personal space what the [ __ ] is

---------00:56----------
that

---------01:01----------
[Music]

---------01:03----------
seriously I want to take a Macbook for

---------01:05----------
the biggest douchebag customer and just

---------01:07----------
fill it with self-leveling concrete I

---------01:08----------
want to do a video titled we finally

---------01:11----------
decided to use self-leveling concrete

---------01:12----------
and just dip a customer's machine right

---------01:15----------
in it ideally it would be if what would

---------01:17----------
occur is a YouTube viewer who said why

---------01:20----------
not self-leveling concrete sent the

---------01:22----------
MacBook in and we just think

---------01:23----------
encapsulated in self-leveling concrete

---------01:25----------
the a 1708 board is uncomfortable to

---------01:28----------
remove from the case because of the

---------01:29----------
Wi-Fi wire area zero zero eight seven

---------01:33----------
five or zero zero four zero this is zero

---------01:35----------
zero eight four zero let's look up this

---------01:37----------
schematic and a board view excuse Paul

---------01:39----------
Daniels his life changing software over

---------01:41----------
here everybody to say thank you to Paul

---------01:46----------
Daniels for making this amazing software

---------01:49----------
that helps me do my job

---------01:51----------
go to youtube.com slash one nine PLD 73

---------01:55----------
that's youtube.com slash 19 P ld7 three

---------02:00----------
and say thank you to Paul Daniels so

---------02:03----------
over here this is the pp 3 v3 underscore

---------02:05----------
g3 hot power supply now many people ask

---------02:07----------
why am I always so concerned about this

---------02:09----------
rail well that's a great question this

---------02:11----------
rail that this chip creates goes to this

---------02:14----------
chip over here so pp 3 V 3 underscore g3

---------02:16----------
hot is going to power the chip that

---------02:19----------
tells the charger to put out 20 volts

---------02:21----------
rather than putting out 5 volts right

---------02:24----------
now my charger is stuck at 5 volts and

---------02:26----------
if you look over here voltage in C that

---------02:31----------
goes over here keep your 3 V 3

---------02:33----------
underscore g3 hot UPC XA and pp 3 b3

---------02:36----------
underscore g3 hot UPC XA comes from pp 3

---------02:42----------
b3 underscore g3 hot so if this chip

---------02:44----------
doesn't create that then this chip over

---------02:46----------
here which is the USB C port controller

---------02:48----------
USB C port controller won't turn on and

---------02:51----------
it won't tell the charger to put out 20

---------02:54----------
volts rather than 5 their arm of this

---------02:57----------
USB C charger this is a universal

---------03:00----------
standard and I can plug this into a

---------03:02----------
GoPro a phone or a MacBook it'll work

---------03:05----------
with everything but it needs to know how

---------03:08----------
much voltage to put out and it's gonna

---------03:09----------
start by putting out the lowest voltage

---------03:10----------
and it's not going to up it until it

---------03:12----------
speaks to that and here's the hmm

---------03:15----------
MacBook

---------03:16----------
oh my 20 volts but it's not it's not

---------03:19----------
doing it so it's not going up itself 220

---------03:21----------
volts until it speaks to that USB C port

---------03:23----------
controller and that USB C port

---------03:24----------
controller is dead because it's

---------03:25----------
powerline it's supposed to be producing

---------03:27----------
it is nothing so let's try and figure

---------03:31----------
out why that's the case so if we switch

---------03:33----------
over here you'll see that this chip

---------03:35----------
needs to be getting enable on pin 10 in

---------03:37----------
order to work so we need it to be enable

---------03:39----------
that's what Ian stands for we also

---------03:41----------
needed to have supply voltage um pin 2

---------03:42----------
so let's check pin 2 and let's also

---------03:46----------
check content so pin 10 is barely

---------03:53----------
visible it's actually really hard to see

---------03:56----------
but it looks like it goes to this probe

---------03:58----------
point right above it so I can just check

---------04:01----------
over here so it looks like the enable is

---------04:04----------
present so it is being asked to turn on

---------04:06----------
so now I am

---------04:08----------
I can't potentially blame the chip if it

---------04:10----------
doesn't want to turn on so now we're

---------04:12----------
gonna go to the other points what are we

---------04:15----------
getting at supply into

---------04:25----------
four point six volts and we have five

---------04:29----------
volts going in five volts going in and

---------04:33----------
that's gonna get lowered a little bit

---------04:36----------
not a lot but a little bit by the diode

---------04:39----------
I also believe there is a zero home

---------04:43----------
resistor r6 906 that's a little far up

---------04:47----------
here yes yeah is there any voltage drop

---------04:51----------
here hello

---------05:01----------
can we go

---------05:05----------
why are you blinking that's strange

---------05:25----------
five point one three it's nice and

---------05:27----------
steady five point one three

---------05:33----------
nice and steady four point six a little

---------05:38----------
bit of voltage drop from the diode this

---------05:40----------
it's fine

---------05:42----------
enable is present output is point three

---------05:47----------
all right now I got to figure out what's

---------05:49----------
pulling it down maybe there's a short

---------05:51----------
circuit to ground on the line 390 let's

---------06:00----------
see point 380 million ohms so that's

---------06:04----------
three hundred eighty thousand ohms so

---------06:07----------
three hundred eighty thousand ohms that

---------06:08----------
doesn't sound like there's a short

---------06:10----------
circuit bringing it down however here's

---------06:12----------
the reason why I think that there is a

---------06:13----------
short circuit even though my meter is

---------06:15----------
lying to me and telling me there is no

---------06:16----------
short circuit the reason I think this is

---------06:18----------
short even though my meter is telling me

---------06:19----------
that there's no short is because it's

---------06:21----------
taking three hundred milliamps

---------06:22----------
when PB 3 V 3 underscore G 3 hot is not

---------06:24----------
present then it's not working typically

---------06:25----------
it takes 10 to 30 milliamps yet it's

---------06:27----------
taking 10 times that amount of power

---------06:29----------
which is not what I would expect if

---------06:31----------
there's no short circuit the short

---------06:32----------
circuit would also explain why it's

---------06:33----------
being pulled down

---------06:34----------
I believe this board may have what's

---------06:35----------
called an active short where the short

---------06:37----------
circuit is only present when there's

---------06:40----------
power going through the affective

---------06:42----------
component so only once the affected

---------06:44----------
component has a charge going through it

---------06:45----------
does it then wind up opening something

---------06:47----------
that shorts the ground so we're gonna

---------06:49----------
see if that's the case using a thermal

---------06:51----------
camera so I'm gonna use the thermal

---------06:53----------
camera let's get that on the desk but

---------06:55----------
before we get that on the desk it looks

---------06:57----------
like we have all-out war opening up here

---------06:59----------
in rossmann repair group and we're gonna

---------07:00----------
have to take care of that first

---------07:08----------
I hit the pilot oh I hit the pilot and

---------07:25----------
the drone counter-terrorist unit what

---------07:33----------
the [ __ ] I hit it you should be dead I

---------07:38----------
want to fill up the short circuit with

---------07:40----------
some self-leveling concrete we should

---------07:42----------
have a self-leveling concrete station at

---------07:44----------
the new place that looks like a water

---------07:45----------
dispenser but it dispenses self-leveling

---------07:48----------
concrete myself level and concrete

---------07:58----------
all right what's taking 300 milliamps

---------08:05----------
see you later Paul four o'clock and

---------08:13----------
what's Jersey

---------08:16----------
alright so this resistor is getting one

---------08:22----------
that's the inrush resistor though each

---------08:27----------
CD 32 15 is a cool twenty seven Celsius

---------08:37----------
on the other side of the board we have

---------08:40----------
something getting warm over here 50

---------08:44----------
Celsius hmm what is that

---------08:47----------
I'm gonna take my tweezer and try to

---------08:49----------
figure out what that is

---------08:58----------
all right now it's right on top of what

---------09:00----------
it is I'm going to engage English mode

---------09:03----------
in the software so it's this chip now is

---------09:06----------
that ship really getting to be 50

---------09:07----------
Celsius ah it seems like it is seems

---------09:13----------
like that could be an active short nice

---------09:15----------
thing I'm kind of interested in is what

---------09:16----------
does that ship do and does pp 3v3

---------09:18----------
underscore g3 hot even go to it there's

---------09:21----------
only one way to find out now isn't there

---------09:23----------
we're gonna use Paul Daniels is amazing

---------09:24----------
software and we're gonna click over and

---------09:27----------
one of the things that I find pretty

---------09:29----------
interesting is Paul Daniel software it

---------09:31----------
says that that chip doesn't exist but am

---------09:35----------
I really what okay that's what that's

---------09:40----------
what the board looks like but the board

---------09:44----------
view says there's nothing there but but

---------09:49----------
there's a chip but the board view says

---------09:51----------
there's nothing there but there's a chip

---------09:52----------
but the board view says there's nothing

---------09:54----------
there but there's a chip at the Apple

---------09:58----------
are you gaslighting me let's replace it

---------10:04----------
let's pray that my I have a full donor

---------10:05----------
board for that not one of those stupid

---------10:07----------
wings and then do you shoot you in the

---------10:12----------
tail ball

---------10:19----------
David that's cruel to shoot somebody in

---------10:21----------
the tailbone like that

---------10:32----------
maybe I have an 875 board view that's

---------10:34----------
labeled zero zero eight four zero yeah

---------10:38----------
because the zero 8 - zero - zero zero

---------10:40----------
eight seven five boy does not have that

---------10:42----------
ship

---------10:53----------
page one says x5o to MLB August 9th 2016

---------11:00----------
yeah maybe they just gave me the wrong

---------11:02----------
board view that's good this schematic is

---------11:04----------
correct but the board view is not well

---------11:11----------
do we have any 0 0 8 4 0 boards there or

---------11:17----------
is it only 2 0 0 8 7 5 Oh beautiful

---------11:24----------
fresh from China well I guess I'm never

---------11:30----------
gonna know what this chip is for

---------11:44----------
neppy Aronoff just confirmed that the 0

---------11:46----------
0 8 7 5 and 0 0 a 4 0 board view is the

---------11:49----------
same file so most likely the we don't

---------11:52----------
have a schematic for this one we don't

---------11:55----------
have a board view for this even if we

---------11:56----------
have a schematic for it that's kind of

---------11:58----------
lame so I'm not really sure what this

---------12:02----------
thing does perhaps this is the spy chip

---------12:10----------
this is the spy on American ship I'm

---------12:13----------
kind of curious if you even need that

---------12:15----------
thing maybe it's just optional

---------12:22----------
Paul Daniels is back everybody give a

---------12:24----------
nice round of applause to Paul Daniels

---------12:26----------
in the chat for producing this amazing

---------12:28----------
software that helps make my life easier

---------12:29----------
and to Pierre nob as well who assists

---------12:31----------
Paul Daniels with the software both

---------12:34----------
talented board repair people and

---------12:36----------
programmers that deserve more credit

---------12:37----------
than they get and money

---------12:46----------
if a nice welcome and hello to Paul

---------12:49----------
Daniels hero of the Republic yeah saying

---------13:01----------
I hate that with what they do with the

---------13:03----------
zero zero one three eight as well

---------13:04----------
because it's enough but try

---------13:06----------
troubleshooting the mem vtt enable

---------13:08----------
circuit using any of the other available

---------13:10----------
schematics so the drive you nuts because

---------13:11----------
the transistors are all opposite there

---------13:13----------
are the other way see you X you have to

---------13:15----------
trace back from the resistors that go to

---------13:16----------
them to fit and then use the dots and

---------13:19----------
the transistors to figure out which way

---------13:20----------
they're oriented to figure out what it

---------13:22----------
is because they use the same transistors

---------13:23----------
in the same MPPT enable circuit just in

---------13:25----------
different spots even if it's a coil

---------13:32----------
cluster what does PP 3v3 underscore d3

---------13:35----------
hot doing going to it don't understand

---------14:18----------
Oh

---------14:24----------
[Music]

---------14:29----------
okay gonna get the board wrap it cool

---------14:31----------
for a moment there I was using this

---------14:33----------
little box cutter as a heat shield for

---------14:35----------
those two under-filled chips down there

---------14:37----------
I don't want anything with underfill on

---------14:38----------
it getting heated

---------15:29----------
all right it's taking 40 milliamps and

---------15:31----------
then it jumps all the way up to 20 volts

---------15:34----------
at 500 milliamps which means it's

---------15:36----------
turning on so I knew that it was gonna

---------15:38----------
turn on from moment I saw I was only

---------15:39----------
taking 40 milliamps rather than 300

---------15:41----------
because the lower milliamp usage means

---------15:43----------
my short is gone if my short was still

---------15:45----------
there then it would have still been

---------15:46----------
taking 300 milliamps from the get-go

---------15:48----------
rather than slowly starting with a small

---------15:50----------
amperage draw and then growing as it

---------15:52----------
doesn't a typical working board again

---------15:54----------
one of the things I think is important

---------15:55----------
to get across here is that you can still

---------15:56----------
have a short circuit even if you don't

---------15:58----------
measure a short circuit you can have

---------16:00----------
300,000 ohms to ground as I did but

---------16:02----------
slava short circuit because the way

---------16:03----------
what's going on is that the chip is only

---------16:06----------
having a short circuit when it has power

---------16:09----------
going through it so once it has power go

---------16:10----------
through it that causes something to go

---------16:13----------
some pathway to open up that wouldn't

---------16:15----------
otherwise open up that sends this power

---------16:18----------
rail to ground and it's something you

---------16:19----------
also can't really measure for because if

---------16:21----------
you try to measure it for a short

---------16:22----------
circuit if you try to use a multimeter

---------16:24----------
to measure the resistance of something

---------16:25----------
with power going through it it's not

---------16:26----------
going to work and that's the issue that

---------16:28----------
we were having here so you can indeed

---------16:30----------
have a short circuit where even if

---------16:33----------
there's a resistance reading of about

---------16:35----------
300,000 Oh mr. Brown which is gonna

---------16:37----------
confuse a lot of people the thermal cam

---------16:38----------
show or that that was getting to 54

---------16:40----------
Celsius which it's not going to do if

---------16:42----------
there's not a short-circuit pp3 v3

---------16:44----------
underscore g3 hot is not going to be

---------16:45----------
point two volts instead of 3.3 volts

---------16:47----------
without a short-circuit if it's creating

---------16:49----------
that much heat so that's it for today

---------16:51----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------16:53----------
something give a shout out to Paul

---------16:54----------
Daniels at youtube.com slash 1 9 P ld7 3

---------16:57----------
that's youtube.com slash 1 9 p LD 7 3 2

---------17:00----------
say thank you very much for this lovely

---------17:02----------
beautiful software that helps us do our

---------17:03----------
job and Happy Holidays Merry Christmas

---------17:06----------
see in the next one
