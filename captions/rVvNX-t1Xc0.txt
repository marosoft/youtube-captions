---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:02----------
we're gonna be working on yet another

---------00:03----------
MacBook I'm sorry that I haven't made

---------00:05----------
time to do more of these board repair

---------00:06----------
videos putting together the new store

---------00:09----------
has been driving me crazy

---------00:10----------
financially stress wise and general work

---------00:13----------
wise and I haven't at the time actually

---------00:15----------
sit in my office organized my office or

---------00:17----------
do much of anything we've been quite

---------00:19----------
busy moving and moving means that people

---------00:21----------
that are moving cannot do their normal

---------00:23----------
work tasks which means that other people

---------00:24----------
must do their tasks plus the pass of the

---------00:27----------
other people who are moving that's a lot

---------00:28----------
of work so sorry that I haven't been

---------00:31----------
able to do the border pair stuff as

---------00:32----------
often as usual this is a board that sent

---------00:34----------
some of us for a loop even though it's a

---------00:35----------
clearly simple and obvious issue and I

---------00:37----------
figured if it's something that send us

---------00:39----------
for a loop it's probably gonna drive you

---------00:41----------
a little nuts as well and I don't like

---------00:42----------
the Hat only having videos that make us

---------00:44----------
look smart I've posted a lots of board

---------00:46----------
repair videos or something obvious and

---------00:48----------
we were just all being idiots and I

---------00:50----------
think that anytime we're idiots and we

---------00:53----------
figure it out that we should share it so

---------00:54----------
that maybe you don't make the same

---------00:56----------
dumbass mistake that we made because

---------00:57----------
let's face it everybody makes a dumbass

---------00:59----------
mistakes most people on the internet or

---------01:00----------
you know they don't like to admit when

---------01:02----------
they do something careless or silly they

---------01:05----------
like to pretend that they're perfect

---------01:06----------
they like to pretend that every single

---------01:07----------
thing they've ever done throughout their

---------01:09----------
entire life is perfectly thought through

---------01:10----------
they've never gotten tired they've never

---------01:12----------
gotten burned out they've never missed

---------01:13----------
something right in front of them because

---------01:14----------
they're just so perfect the beauty of

---------01:16----------
the anonymity of the Internet so here

---------01:18----------
I'd like to show you what was going on

---------01:21----------
with this MacBook Air and what I think

---------01:23----------
some of you may miss if you miss read

---------01:26----------
the schematic the same way that all of

---------01:28----------
us here misread the schematic this board

---------01:30----------
went through multiple people and all of

---------01:31----------
us perhaps because we're tired Babs

---------01:33----------
because some day we get here at 7:00 I

---------01:35----------
don't leave until 9:00 or 10:00 because

---------01:36----------
of moving we just we just did some

---------01:38----------
stupid [ __ ] so this was a no backlight

---------01:41----------
MacBook Air and I'd like to show you

---------01:43----------
some of the preliminary work that was

---------01:45----------
done here you can see that there's quite

---------01:47----------
a bit of work in the backlight the

---------01:49----------
enable area this is going to be a

---------01:52----------
transistor that sends the backlight

---------01:55----------
power to the entire circuit so here you

---------01:57----------
have the backlight fuse which never blow

---------01:59----------
is because it's a MacBook then you have

---------02:01----------
the transistor that it goes to and this

---------02:03----------
transistor is going to open or close and

---------02:05----------
send backlight power throughout the rest

---------02:07----------
of the backlight circuit but this

---------02:08----------
transits the rest open for that to

---------02:09----------
happen and this transistor is going to

---------02:11----------
govern whether this transistor

---------02:13----------
opens so we are going to open up the

---------02:16----------
schematic over here so this is eight

---------02:19----------
volts from the battery it's gonna go

---------02:21----------
through the fuse and this transistor is

---------02:23----------
gonna open closed to allow power to pass

---------02:26----------
through the circuit

---------02:26----------
you don't want backlight power going

---------02:28----------
through the circuit at all times because

---------02:29----------
maybe you've got the lid closed maybe

---------02:30----------
you've got your energy saver preferences

---------02:32----------
has set up so that the screen turns off

---------02:33----------
after two minutes no needs have power

---------02:35----------
going through if it's not supposed to

---------02:37----------
now the question is if the CPU works on

---------02:40----------
three volt logic yet this transistor is

---------02:43----------
going open or closed based on higher

---------02:45----------
voltage logic how does that work so this

---------02:48----------
transistor that you see is a p-channel

---------02:50----------
one of the things that I went over in my

---------02:52----------
how does a transistor work video is that

---------02:54----------
a transistor is going open based on the

---------02:57----------
voltage at its gate so see over here you

---------02:59----------
have these transistors these make it a

---------03:00----------
little bit more obvious because they

---------03:02----------
have gate source drain it's all written

---------03:05----------
so powers gonna go you know chose the

---------03:07----------
drain drain a source depending on what's

---------03:09----------
at the gate think of it like a light

---------03:10----------
switch you know this is gonna be a

---------03:11----------
hundred twenty volts that's gonna be the

---------03:13----------
wire to your light bulb and this would

---------03:15----------
be the physical switch at the gate

---------03:16----------
except instead of a physical switch it's

---------03:17----------
an electrical one now this is AP type

---------03:21----------
MOSFET why does that matter there are

---------03:22----------
two types of transistors that I give a

---------03:24----------
crap about when fixing an iPhone or a

---------03:26----------
MacBook P channel or n channel AP

---------03:29----------
channel MOSFET the way this works is the

---------03:31----------
gate voltage is going to determine

---------03:33----------
whether it opens now with a P channel

---------03:34----------
MOSFET when the voltage in the gate is

---------03:36----------
lower than the source it turns on and on

---------03:40----------
an N channel MOSFET like these ones when

---------03:42----------
the power on the voltage and the gate is

---------03:43----------
higher than the source it turns on if

---------03:45----------
you're not sure if this is an N or a P

---------03:47----------
channel MOSFET you can just Google the

---------03:49----------
number of the transistor and sometimes

---------03:51----------
the schematic may be nice and even tell

---------03:52----------
you right next to it if the Apple

---------03:54----------
engineer was feeling happy that day

---------03:55----------
maybe you got late or something he'll

---------03:57----------
write p-type so that you don't have to

---------04:00----------
Google and that's what seems to have

---------04:02----------
happened here so everybody say thank you

---------04:04----------
to the Apple engineer that wrote the

---------04:05----------
type of MOSFET right here so that we

---------04:08----------
don't have to Google you can also tell

---------04:10----------
by looking at the picture but if you're

---------04:12----------
really new to this you're probably going

---------04:13----------
to forget what the picture is you have

---------04:15----------
here is a resistor and this resistor is

---------04:18----------
going to take the 8 volts from the fuse

---------04:19----------
and it's going to immediately move it to

---------04:21----------
the gate now the resistor is not gonna

---------04:23----------
have a real voltage drop across it so

---------04:24----------
you're gonna have 8 volts in the source

---------04:25----------
and 8 volts in the gate which

---------04:27----------
this thing never opens and never turns

---------04:28----------
on right but wait there's more

---------04:31----------
you have another resistor on the bottom

---------04:32----------
that's going between viv gate and

---------04:35----------
grounds this will act as a voltage

---------04:37----------
divider I went over this in my wood as a

---------04:39----------
voltage divider and how does that work

---------04:41----------
video a voltage divider is gonna take

---------04:43----------
the voltage that's at the top and lower

---------04:45----------
it you put one resistor between the high

---------04:46----------
voltage and what you want the voltage to

---------04:48----------
be lowered and another resistor between

---------04:50----------
where you want the voltage to be lower

---------04:51----------
and ground and that is going to lower

---------04:54----------
your voltage but in order for this

---------04:55----------
voltage divider to work this has got to

---------04:57----------
hit ground right or else it's not gonna

---------04:58----------
have any place to send it this needs to

---------05:00----------
go to ground and what's blocking it from

---------05:02----------
getting to ground but these two

---------05:03----------
transistors so these two transistors are

---------05:06----------
going to open when you have EDP

---------05:09----------
backlight enable and backlight platform

---------05:11----------
reset L present and then this voltage

---------05:13----------
will get sent to ground which means that

---------05:15----------
this will be a happy little voltage

---------05:17----------
divider which will divide the voltage

---------05:18----------
and then instead of having eight volts

---------05:20----------
over here you'll have something unlike

---------05:21----------
two or four volts and then this

---------05:23----------
transistor will open and this area

---------05:25----------
looked very messed up so it looks like

---------05:26----------
all of that was reworked you can see the

---------05:29----------
little the two resistors over here for

---------05:31----------
that voltage divider are nicely soldered

---------05:33----------
on you have your happy little jumper

---------05:37----------
wire over here all is good all as well

---------05:39----------
these Pro points and these have these

---------05:41----------
pads have all been fixed up to look

---------05:43----------
nicer so let's see where it is this

---------05:46----------
board left off before it got its way

---------05:49----------
here that's the F boy so I'm gonna turn

---------05:51----------
on Paul Daniels as lovely and amazing

---------05:53----------
multimeter software so that you can see

---------05:56----------
and follow along on the screen what it

---------05:58----------
is that we're doing now if I take a look

---------06:02----------
at the backlight fuse you'll see that we

---------06:05----------
have eight volts there and just change

---------06:07----------
the range on the meter let's see we have

---------06:09----------
the eight volts that I expect from the

---------06:11----------
battery on the other side of the

---------06:12----------
backlight views we've also got eight

---------06:14----------
volts now if we go to the beginning of

---------06:16----------
this transistor over here q7 706 the

---------06:22----------
input is going to be on pin four you

---------06:25----------
measure that

---------06:31----------
eight volts now on pin one that's going

---------06:35----------
to be where it's outputting right yeah

---------06:43----------
let's try that again

---------06:51----------
eight votes

---------06:57----------
I just blocked fuse lol okay I just

---------07:02----------
mixed something with my multimeter

---------07:05----------
probes so let me just replace that

---------07:06----------
backlight fuse that I just blew up live

---------07:09----------
on camera I'm not sure if you guys were

---------07:11----------
able to catch that but I just took that

---------07:15----------
fuse and went poof with it

---------07:20----------
that's the beauty of editing is that

---------07:22----------
nobody has to see just how stupid I am

---------07:26----------
the only so much do pity I'm gonna put

---------07:29----------
no.1 video I'll let you guys see some

---------07:31----------
stupidity but you know it takes work

---------07:34----------
because I just blew a fuse in an Apple

---------07:36----------
product

---------07:38----------
you know how adorable those damn fuses

---------07:40----------
are those do not come off easily all

---------07:46----------
right I'm gonna take that fuse and I'm

---------07:48----------
gonna put another one on but I'm gonna

---------07:49----------
put this fuse on backwards in protest

---------07:51----------
I'm using hot tweezers instead of hot

---------07:53----------
air which is making life hard for no

---------07:55----------
good reason for the people that asked

---------07:57----------
why I don't use hot Weezer's like watch

---------07:59----------
so see this is the backlight fuse right

---------08:02----------
I'm just gonna sit there with my

---------08:04----------
tweezers 5 4 3 2 1 it's this is so

---------08:11----------
annoying

---------08:12----------
come on like there we go oh my god I

---------08:19----------
could probably make my own fuse in the

---------08:21----------
time it takes to t solder or something

---------08:22----------
which Weezer's you're not a P now you're

---------08:24----------
a D and putting too much effort into try

---------08:27----------
to make this perfectly straight

---------08:33----------
good enough for rock-and-roll I'd say I

---------08:36----------
blew an apple fuse okay we got eight

---------08:38----------
volts eight volts on the other side of

---------08:43----------
the fuse eight volts on the input of the

---------08:46----------
transistor eight volts in the output of

---------08:50----------
the transistor zero volts on the coil

---------08:54----------
and if you take a look at the schematic

---------08:56----------
and the board view you'll see that this

---------08:59----------
is supposed to go from the transistor to

---------09:02----------
the coil P P VIN SOS WL CD booklet FET

---------09:06----------
pp VIN SOS w LC d bic lit this goes to

---------09:12----------
here now it's not connected on the

---------09:13----------
screen it says there is a sense resistor

---------09:15----------
between P P bus s WL CD booklet per and

---------09:18----------
P P bus SW bit lit on the sensor page

---------09:21----------
and if we follow along on the board view

---------09:23----------
over here we click you'll see that this

---------09:26----------
doesn't go directly to the coil this

---------09:28----------
doesn't go directly to l7 7:01 it goes

---------09:31----------
to this R 5490 R 5490 so let's take a

---------09:36----------
look at our 5490 now when you look on

---------09:39----------
the schematic this is a resistor that's

---------09:42----------
not actually there so most people are

---------09:44----------
gonna say at this point well this

---------09:46----------
resistor is not actually there so why

---------09:48----------
would I check it R 5490 says omit see

---------09:52----------
where it says omit no resistor there and

---------09:54----------
as you'll see when you look on the board

---------09:56----------
there is no resistor placed for our 5490

---------10:01----------
but what you can see is that the

---------10:03----------
transistor clearly makes a pathway from

---------10:07----------
the to the coil through this so here's

---------10:11----------
the transistors output right over here

---------10:13----------
I'm just gonna up the lighting on the

---------10:15----------
camera over here so that you could see

---------10:16----------
up the exposure to some lets up that to

---------10:20----------
an influence or level of exposure there

---------10:22----------
and you could see that the transistors

---------10:26----------
output goes to here and then they don't

---------10:31----------
have a current sense resistor here this

---------10:32----------
is actually just you know this

---------10:34----------
essentially might as well just be bare

---------10:36----------
wire inside the PC board where here goes

---------10:39----------
to here and that's going to go over to

---------10:40----------
the coil so the coil is going to

---------10:44----------
receive its power not from our 5490 but

---------10:48----------
from this trace on the board where they

---------10:49----------
decided we're just not gonna put a

---------10:50----------
resistor there screw having a current

---------10:52----------
sense circuit we'll leave that for the

---------10:53----------
retinas and there's supposed to be a

---------10:56----------
trace there but there's not because you

---------10:57----------
have this thing over here and what some

---------10:59----------
people may think is I'm not gonna check

---------11:01----------
that resistor because the board

---------11:02----------
schematic says it's not there so why

---------11:05----------
bother why would I check the schematic

---------11:07----------
to see what the resistance is of a not

---------11:09----------
present resistor well just take a look

---------11:12----------
at the board yeah there's no resistor

---------11:14----------
there they omitted it but they replaced

---------11:15----------
it with a wire and that's clearly burned

---------11:17----------
off in the first trace you know what a

---------11:20----------
current sensing circuit would do is a

---------11:21----------
current sensing circuit would say oh it

---------11:23----------
looks like you're using too much power

---------11:25----------
please stop before you die this is a

---------11:27----------
very useful type of circuit to have it's

---------11:29----------
also why on the MacBook Pro retina x'

---------11:31----------
you don't see backlight fuses blowing

---------11:33----------
from 2013 and after whereas they do blow

---------11:36----------
on the a 1466 a 1465 and a 1369 and so

---------11:41----------
on and so forth it's because they don't

---------11:42----------
have a current sensing circuit the

---------11:44----------
current sensing circuit would cost Apple

---------11:46----------
probably an additional 19 cents to put

---------11:49----------
in there and you you only bought the

---------11:51----------
$999 computer you did buy the $1,200

---------11:54----------
computer so what the hell do you think

---------11:56----------
you're getting do you think they're

---------11:58----------
actually gonna put that extra 19 cents

---------12:00----------
in and make sure that the fuse doesn't

---------12:02----------
blow so that if you remove the short

---------12:03----------
it'll just work again nice and easily

---------12:05----------
without soldering when you only bought

---------12:07----------
the $999 model get the eff added here so

---------12:10----------
they actually put all of this in place

---------12:12----------
and I will say I will compliment Apple

---------12:14----------
on the fact that the a 1502 s and the a

---------12:16----------
1398 from 2013 and onwards do have a

---------12:20----------
current sensing circuit there the way

---------12:21----------
that works is you have a current sensing

---------12:22----------
resistor and if it notices and what

---------12:25----------
you'll you'll have the backlight chip

---------12:29----------
reading voltage on each side of the

---------12:33----------
resistor and if there's too much of a

---------12:35----------
voltage drop

---------12:35----------
it'll assume too much powers being drawn

---------12:37----------
and immediately close this transistor

---------12:39----------
rather than just letting it go because

---------12:41----------
right now this transistor is gonna be

---------12:42----------
open like if there's a short to ground

---------12:44----------
it don't care that transistor is open

---------12:46----------
and it's just blowing through everything

---------12:47----------
but on the retina models that is not the

---------12:50----------
case they have a current sensing circuit

---------12:52----------
I can show you that by opening up

---------12:54----------
another

---------12:55----------
I'm addict here for perhaps a different

---------12:56----------
machine let's see if we have more modern

---------13:01----------
something here we go something like this

---------13:03----------
we'll open up the back light circuit for

---------13:05----------
this model and see this is going to be

---------13:08----------
your current sensing circuit so you have

---------13:12----------
the fuse and you have the transistor

---------13:14----------
before it goes to the back light circuit

---------13:16----------
but before that you have this resistor

---------13:17----------
and this is a current sense resistor

---------13:19----------
this is a shunt resistor so you have a

---------13:23----------
resistor and then on each side of the

---------13:26----------
resistor you have a line going to the

---------13:27----------
LED driver it's going to sense the

---------13:29----------
voltage here and the voltage there and

---------13:30----------
if there is a great large voltage drop

---------13:33----------
then it's going to assume that it's

---------13:35----------
using too much power and turn off the

---------13:36----------
way that the backlight driver chip is

---------13:38----------
going to know exactly how much amperage

---------13:40----------
the backlight circuit is using is by

---------13:42----------
checking the difference in voltage

---------13:44----------
between the input of the current sense

---------13:47----------
resistor and the output and then it's

---------13:49----------
going to turn this transistor off so if

---------13:50----------
there's a short to ground then it sees

---------13:52----------
whoa why is the backlight circuit using

---------13:54----------
three or five or six amps this

---------13:56----------
transistor turns off and now the short

---------13:58----------
circuit on the backlight side does not

---------14:00----------
have a way to get to ground and that's

---------14:02----------
what saves you from having boards that

---------14:05----------
look like this because before it can get

---------14:07----------
to this point it will get turned off

---------14:09----------
it's not going to get to this point

---------14:10----------
unless it's been you know passing a

---------14:13----------
ridiculous amount of current for quite a

---------14:14----------
while courtesy of Apple's bulletproof

---------14:17----------
good old-fashioned backlight fuse so how

---------14:19----------
are we going to fix this well that's a

---------14:20----------
great question so what we do is I'm

---------14:23----------
simply gonna put a little jumper wire

---------14:25----------
between the transistor in here and then

---------14:27----------
it's going to work just fine and then I

---------14:30----------
can smack myself upside the head for not

---------14:33----------
noticing this sooner I don't know just

---------14:37----------
for fun all right so let's spot over

---------14:41----------
this in place get a nice little wire

---------14:44----------
over there I'm not gonna use something

---------14:46----------
that's too crazy maybe I'll see here so

---------14:51----------
backlight circuit is carrying a little

---------14:53----------
bit more than normal so I'm not gonna

---------14:55----------
use in like a 44 or 46 gauge wire I'm

---------14:57----------
gonna use a 36 gauge wire because this

---------15:02----------
this does need to carry something where

---------15:03----------
you know the screen is gonna be one of

---------15:05----------
the things that takes more power in the

---------15:06----------
machine

---------15:07----------
and it's not carrying it for a long

---------15:09----------
distance it's carrying it for a very

---------15:10----------
short distance but it should still be it

---------15:13----------
should still be capable of carrying a

---------15:15----------
decent amount of power so we're just

---------15:16----------
gonna do that I'm going to remove the

---------15:20----------
enamel on this enamel wire so that and

---------15:23----------
that it doesn't there we go so that it

---------15:27----------
can actually conduct remember those two

---------15:30----------
top pins are the same thing so it

---------15:32----------
doesn't matter if they're shorted and

---------15:35----------
you use a set of tweezers they're not

---------15:38----------
broken difficult to find

---------15:41----------
looks like somebody in my chat said that

---------15:43----------
they would use speaker wire for this you

---------15:45----------
are absolutely mad you're out of your

---------15:49----------
damn mind you're out of control my

---------15:53----------
friend you really want to just to make

---------15:58----------
you happy just to make that person happy

---------16:00----------
you know what I'll do I'll double up on

---------16:02----------
it hey alright see so i'll solder -

---------16:10----------
there you go hopefully that makes you

---------16:12----------
happy now you got a nice doubled up wire

---------16:16----------
so you have even more powers more wires

---------16:20----------
for more powers more gauges for more

---------16:23----------
back lights yeah look at that that's

---------16:30----------
nice and strong also I can tell that

---------16:34----------
this solder joins on the capacitor up

---------16:36----------
there who is soldered with not the right

---------16:39----------
amount of flux so we're just going to

---------16:41----------
add flux and watch what happens to that

---------16:43----------
nasty see how that it looks like a

---------16:45----------
Hershey's kiss right over here this

---------16:46----------
looks like a Hershey's kiss that's no

---------16:48----------
good you want to have the right amount

---------16:50----------
of flux so that when you saw it or it

---------16:51----------
looks like that it is not this excess

---------16:54----------
[ __ ] sticking out that's what happens

---------16:55----------
when you don't use the right amount of

---------16:56----------
flux and this is why I more flux is

---------16:59----------
better than less for me because more you

---------17:01----------
know it's gonna get ultrasonic to off

---------17:02----------
the board anyway I don't care okay

---------17:04----------
everything there looks nice now I'm

---------17:06----------
going to see what I get on back light

---------17:08----------
output do I still get 0 volts going

---------17:09----------
through the circuit or does it work

---------17:11----------
properly that's a great question so

---------17:19----------
should have used zero AWG wire see

---------17:22----------
that's going a little overboard that's

---------17:25----------
that that may just be a little bit too

---------17:26----------
much just a little bit okay so we're

---------17:30----------
going to put the multimeter back on the

---------17:32----------
screen so that you can all see what is

---------17:35----------
showing up let's see so now the input of

---------17:40----------
the coil is getting eight that's

---------17:42----------
beautiful

---------17:42----------
now let's see what the backlight is

---------17:45----------
getting eight okay that's no good

---------17:49----------
backlight it's not supposed to be a

---------17:51----------
volts so now let's check the other side

---------17:53----------
of the board and check the rest of the

---------17:54----------
backlight circuit so at least we have

---------17:55----------
eight volts going to the circuit now

---------17:57----------
that transistor that was not opening

---------17:58----------
before is opening so we're gonna check

---------18:01----------
through the rest of this board and see

---------18:02----------
what's going on there I see flux I see

---------18:06----------
an LED driver section that looks like

---------18:08----------
it's had corrosion so we are just going

---------18:11----------
to remove that no biggie

---------18:16----------
what do you think about the new we think

---------18:17----------
pad especially the fold it looks to me

---------18:18----------
to be pretty much unrepairable that you

---------18:20----------
agree I haven't seen it honestly like

---------18:23----------
it's not like any of these companies

---------18:25----------
send me free [ __ ] so I have no reason to

---------18:27----------
buy new stuff I pretty much use what I

---------18:31----------
own until it's destroyed like even my

---------18:32----------
Sony camera that's I haven't at the time

---------18:34----------
to replace the HDMI port on it but I got

---------18:37----------
a new HDMI port and I plan to open it at

---------18:39----------
some point and get it fixed because I

---------18:41----------
don't feel like buying another camera

---------18:42----------
because I'm a cheapskate and this one

---------18:44----------
does the job just fine sanding on my

---------18:47----------
think pad you know my think pad does its

---------18:48----------
job

---------18:48----------
I don't not really buying a new one any

---------18:50----------
time soon this is no reason for me you

---------18:52----------
know it would be nice to have something

---------18:53----------
slightly newer but I don't really have a

---------18:55----------
like I don't not really paying for a new

---------18:58----------
one any time soon so I haven't really

---------19:00----------
seen them and like I'm not a real

---------19:04----------
influencer I'm an influencer in the

---------19:06----------
sense that I get spam from Nord VPN even

---------19:08----------
after making two videos about why I

---------19:10----------
don't show the VPN saying that they'll

---------19:12----------
pay me a modicum of money for shelling

---------19:15----------
Nord VPN or I get people sending me

---------19:17----------
emails about Schilling shitty android

---------19:20----------
games but I don't actually get like cool

---------19:22----------
stuff you know

---------19:26----------
if you think I'm the dude that gets the

---------19:29----------
newest ThinkPads and the newest you know

---------19:31----------
the what HP's or LG phones or whatever

---------19:37----------
as soon as they come out you're you're

---------19:39----------
thinking of the wrong youtuber it's

---------19:46----------
pretty much just Nord VPN emails here

---------19:48----------
for me there's not really much of a

---------19:52----------
reason for me to consider the new thing

---------19:53----------
pads honestly when I looked it up my

---------19:55----------
think pad has a 10,000 something CPU

---------19:57----------
benchmark score right so I got about a

---------20:01----------
10,000 CPU benchmark score now if I were

---------20:03----------
to go and buy the most expensive p73 I

---------20:05----------
could like really maxed it out as hard

---------20:07----------
as I could I don't think I'd get more

---------20:09----------
than 17 or 18,000 on CPU benchmark but

---------20:12----------
that's if I'm paying for like the

---------20:13----------
top-of-the-line best of the best thing

---------20:15----------
pad and that's that's not really good

---------20:19----------
enough I mean I'm not even doubling my

---------20:21----------
performance but I'm gonna take my think

---------20:24----------
pad that was about $1,200 I got mine as

---------20:26----------
a refurb piece of [ __ ] with a Z on 15:15

---------20:29----------
and I'm gonna spend you know four or

---------20:31----------
five thousand dollars in another machine

---------20:33----------
just to get a marginal improvement now

---------20:35----------
that's not happening I got like this

---------20:39----------
there's really no reason for me to get a

---------20:40----------
new one

---------20:49----------
that backlight enable resistor looked

---------20:51----------
like it could have been soldered better

---------20:53----------
now if it gets the point

---------20:56----------
where I can get 25,000 or 30,000 CPU

---------21:01----------
benchmark score then we're then we can

---------21:04----------
talk then we can have a conversation

---------21:06----------
about whether or not it's worth it for

---------21:07----------
me to upgrade my computer but like going

---------21:09----------
from a 9,000 to an 18,000 for three

---------21:12----------
times the money it's like what the hell

---------21:13----------
is the point maybe if I had money to

---------21:16----------
burn but no I wonder what their criteria

---------21:19----------
is Lenovo has had a bunch of really

---------21:20----------
fancy laptops that many people in the

---------21:22----------
open-source world you probably should

---------21:25----------
not badmouth them when they ruin their

---------21:27----------
interface by getting rid of the track

---------21:30----------
point middle button and when they

---------21:33----------
release a retro think pad that sucks and

---------21:35----------
doesn't have any of the features that

---------21:36----------
anybody asked for in the and the survey

---------21:39----------
don't say out loud that it sucked that's

---------21:42----------
probably the criteria if I had to guess

---------21:44----------
I'm most likely those two things okay we

---------21:46----------
have one resistor here that looks like

---------21:48----------
it's missing as well that I should put

---------21:49----------
back on back light I said that's a 21.5

---------21:53----------
K there was a company that sent me a

---------21:55----------
microscope at dyno light it was such a

---------21:57----------
piece of crap was like seven or eight

---------21:59----------
hundred dollars I mean it was

---------22:01----------
unimaginable what a piece of [ __ ] this

---------22:03----------
thing was it was almost like they took a

---------22:04----------
25 year old cheap CCTV camera and shoved

---------22:08----------
it on top of a microscope stand and

---------22:10----------
thought that I was going to say

---------22:11----------
something nice about it it was

---------22:13----------
hysterical the thing is I'd love to give

---------22:16----------
a good review of a product I think I

---------22:18----------
gave a very fine review to the ThinkPad

---------22:20----------
P 50 and I think I covered it from the

---------22:22----------
perspective that most other people don't

---------22:24----------
you know everybody else is covering it

---------22:26----------
from the like what what cpu benchmark

---------22:29----------
score does it get which is something

---------22:31----------
that's already kind of answered by most

---------22:32----------
stuff online I was covering it from the

---------22:35----------
perspective of usability and I gave it a

---------22:42----------
good review because I thought it was

---------22:43----------
actually a really good computer you know

---------22:45----------
I actually purchased it and I owned it I

---------22:47----------
spilled about a quart of water onto my

---------22:51----------
own think pad while it was on that's how

---------22:53----------
much I believed in the product you know

---------22:55----------
that wasn't a gimmick or B yes that was

---------22:57----------
me actually doing that

---------23:00----------
but I also have given a lot of other

---------23:03----------
reviews or I say what I think of the

---------23:04----------
product and I think that really does

---------23:09----------
screw you over with regards to that

---------23:10----------
whole influencer thing like once you

---------23:12----------
start saying what you think of the

---------23:14----------
product on a regular basis not just once

---------23:16----------
or twice that really screws you because

---------23:18----------
you you I mean there are people that

---------23:19----------
have to do that every now and then to at

---------23:21----------
least give you the illusion that they're

---------23:23----------
impartial or like but you know they they

---------23:25----------
pretend you know and 1 out of every 10

---------23:28----------
reviews that the product is a total

---------23:30----------
piece of [ __ ] or they come up with these

---------23:32----------
superficial ways of saying that they're

---------23:34----------
not fully happy with the product but you

---------23:38----------
can only do that every now and then you

---------23:42----------
can't do it for like every review ever

---------23:43----------
done good-evening sending positive vibes

---------23:45----------
to everyone watching thank you very much

---------23:47----------
I appreciate that so let's see if we

---------23:49----------
have a let's see if we have output here

---------23:53----------
give me a backlight give me your

---------23:55----------
backlight

---------24:05----------
[Music]

---------24:14----------
okay backlight output is what Ajo 22

---------24:21----------
that is backlight for an error yep 22

---------24:25----------
and if I put this up I'm not sure if

---------24:27----------
you'll even see the light because I have

---------24:28----------
all these little backlight all these

---------24:30----------
little lights on here these camera

---------24:32----------
lights so can you see that you have to

---------24:36----------
trust me that that's a working backlight

---------24:37----------
because I don't have a way to turn off

---------24:39----------
the camera light from here and then all

---------24:40----------
of my overhead camera anymore either so

---------24:43----------
that is a working backlight we got 22

---------24:44----------
volts at backlight output so hopefully

---------24:46----------
this helps you avoid the mistake that we

---------24:48----------
made here from being very tired and very

---------24:51----------
overworked it's gonna I figure that if

---------24:54----------
we made the mistake as possible someone

---------24:56----------
else could make it just because the

---------24:57----------
component in the schematic says omit or

---------24:59----------
no stuff doesn't mean you don't test it

---------25:02----------
just because the component is not there

---------25:04----------
doesn't mean it can't still troll you

---------25:06----------
the component was not there but the

---------25:08----------
trace was there so instead of having a

---------25:11----------
resistor they just decided to jumper the

---------25:13----------
trace inside of the board and that

---------25:15----------
jumper trace inside of the board was

---------25:17----------
completely burned out because Apple I

---------25:19----------
can blow the backlight fuse when testing

---------25:21----------
but the backlight fuse won't blow when

---------25:23----------
the board is physically burning through

---------25:26----------
layers it's an Apple product that's it

---------25:31----------
for today and as always I hope you

---------25:33----------
learned something again my apologies

---------25:35----------
that I haven't been able to do these

---------25:36----------
videos more regularly but I do need to

---------25:38----------
focus more on getting customers in and

---------25:40----------
out the door and on the financial

---------25:42----------
stability of my new place more so than

---------25:45----------
the than the YouTube stuff just for a

---------25:47----------
short period of time but once that's

---------25:49----------
done I will get back to doing board

---------25:50----------
repair videos on a more regular basis in

---------25:53----------
this lovely new office we've got a bunch

---------25:54----------
of acoustic panel showing up on Tuesday

---------25:56----------
we got more more racks and stuff showing

---------25:58----------
up there's more stuff showing up from

---------25:59----------
the new store today and tomorrow and we

---------26:02----------
are gonna be putting the stuff together

---------26:04----------
and I hope for it to be a lovely new

---------26:07----------
place it is much less claustrophobic and

---------26:08----------
once the place is actually done I'm sure

---------26:10----------
it'll be great we do have hearings and I

---------26:13----------
believe Colorado and Maryland showing up

---------26:17----------
on I believe March 5th and March 11th so

---------26:20----------
do look that up on legendre discord

---------26:22----------
there should be a link down below to

---------26:23----------
join the discord so you can keep track

---------26:24----------
of when these right to repair hearings

---------26:26----------
or

---------26:27----------
kurung I'm going to do my absolute best

---------26:28----------
to monster just like plow through all

---------26:31----------
the tickets here setting everything up

---------26:33----------
and get in the place up and run and

---------26:34----------
financially fit so that I'm able to make

---------26:36----------
these hearings and testify them I can't

---------26:39----------
promise it but like 99% I'll be able to

---------26:41----------
do it and I hope to see some of you

---------26:43----------
there if I'm able to make it so that's

---------26:45----------
it for today and I'll see you all in the

---------26:47----------
next video bye
