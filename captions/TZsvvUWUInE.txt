Oh next computer died Corona died Corona

---------00:13----------
burn Corona burn Corona died Clinton the

---------00:25----------
cat suka bullet

---------00:35----------
all right let's unplug the battery here

---------00:49----------
okay we have 20 mili-amps being taken

---------00:55----------
hmm well wonder why we're only getting

---------00:58----------
20 mili-amps let's see what our pp bus

---------01:06----------
g3 hottest our pp bus appears to be zero

---------01:15----------
volts yet we're at 20 volts but 19 per

---------01:19----------
94 volts so our cd32 15s are likely

---------01:22----------
doing their job which means P V 3 V 3

---------01:24----------
underscore g3 hots present let's get the

---------01:27----------
board out of the case and go from there

---------01:34----------
we're doing good since we have a one-arm

---------01:36----------
short to ground on the PP bus of g3 hot

---------01:40----------
let's see if we can figure out what it

---------01:43----------
is I think I know what it is do any of

---------01:49----------
you do any of you

---------02:16----------
this is where Paul would say it's not

---------02:17----------
fair and Paul would have a point Paul

---------02:24----------
would have a point

---------03:38----------
some days you don't feel like turning on

---------03:40----------
your hot air station so what you can do

---------03:43----------
is you can kind of heat both sides of

---------03:45----------
the component by heating one side and

---------03:47----------
letting the heat travel to the other or

---------03:48----------
if the other side doesn't want to heat

---------03:50----------
much

---------03:50----------
well it'll you can still kind of lift up

---------03:52----------
the component from one side and even if

---------03:58----------
it is a surface mount component you can

---------03:59----------
solder it without hot Weezer's or a

---------04:01----------
hot-air station what you do is use you

---------04:06----------
solder one side of the board over here

---------04:09----------
so over here what I could do is I could

---------04:11----------
solder let's say only this side like so

---------04:16----------
and then I can slide that component

---------04:20----------
right in so I'm gonna take it off of a

---------04:22----------
donor right now

---------04:23----------
so what should we do here so I'm gonna

---------04:26----------
slide this cap from the donor board and

---------04:28----------
on the top alright cuz remember I can

---------04:31----------
only really heat one side properly I can

---------04:34----------
only heat one side of this cap properly

---------04:36----------
so I'm gonna heat the side where there

---------04:41----------
is solder but it's gonna be flat on the

---------04:44----------
board on the other side because there's

---------04:45----------
no solder on the other side so I can

---------04:47----------
just do this push down add some flux and

---------04:54----------
then we saw to the other side and it'll

---------04:57----------
be flat on the board

---------05:09----------
see no harder station needed

---------05:18----------
this for those of you wondering since

---------05:20----------
that came up in my chat recently how

---------05:21----------
would I replace one of these components

---------05:23----------
if I don't have a hot-air station and if

---------05:25----------
you have it a soldering iron you you

---------05:28----------
really can get a lot of the job done

---------05:29----------
that you would typically use a hot-air

---------05:31----------
station for I mean you may be able to

---------05:33----------
get it done cleaner if you have hot

---------05:35----------
tweezers larger hot tweezers or a saw or

---------05:38----------
a hot-air station for sure it's gonna be

---------05:40----------
cleaner but just if you want to have an

---------05:42----------
idea of how you can actually get the job

---------05:43----------
done and you can see that it's pretty

---------05:46----------
strong there you know I can't really

---------05:47----------
just knock or pry it off and there's no

---------05:49----------
way for me to get under it because it's

---------05:51----------
flat on the board already so now what I

---------05:53----------
want to do is I want to see if I got rid

---------05:55----------
of my short circuit it's kind of curious

---------05:57----------
there so I'm gonna check my BP bus g3

---------05:59----------
huh my pp bus right here

---------06:11----------
not shorted anymore yep three kilohms

---------06:16----------
and rising quickly so when I plug this

---------06:20----------
in it's gonna take six hundred milliamps

---------06:22----------
which means it's gonna be turning on

---------06:23----------
you're gonna see that the amperage is

---------06:24----------
gonna be jumping up down up down up down

---------06:26----------
like it should be on a nice fixed happy

---------06:28----------
MacBook and Sims Luis can actually plug

---------06:33----------
the charger in properly big if there you

---------06:37----------
go

---------06:38----------
575 thirty-eight 536 568 that's a happy

---------06:42----------
MacBook all it really needed was for me

---------06:44----------
to remove that one capacitor on PP bunch

---------06:45----------
d3 hot the main power rail that was bad

---------06:47----------
it could see what my eyes I didn't

---------06:49----------
brilliant really need a microscope for

---------06:50----------
it and you can see just for the hell of

---------06:52----------
it I didn't use hot air again you don't

---------06:54----------
always need to use hot air to replace

---------06:55----------
the component what you do is you remove

---------06:57----------
it the way I showed you once it's

---------06:59----------
removed you have Cu wick the pads you

---------07:02----------
have solder on one pad the other ones

---------07:03----------
flat could number your iron can only

---------07:05----------
heat one pad at a time so you're gonna

---------07:07----------
heat that one pad that you put solder on

---------07:09----------
slide the capacitor in while it's you

---------07:12----------
know pushed pushing the capacitor flat

---------07:13----------
on the board then when you're done you

---------07:15----------
can solder the other side and it will be

---------07:18----------
nice and flat on the board because if

---------07:19----------
you have solder on both pads you can

---------07:22----------
only saw it on one at a time so you're

---------07:23----------
gonna wind up by the cap like this is

---------07:25----------
the board right let's say this is the

---------07:27----------
board and the cap is gonna be sitting on

---------07:29----------
it like this and there's gonna be this

---------07:30----------
big wedge between the cap and the board

---------07:32----------
or the SMD and the board and then you

---------07:35----------
keep it's it's easier for it to pry off

---------07:37----------
or break off or anything like that and

---------07:39----------
that's just kind of sad you don't want

---------07:40----------
that to happen so that's about it for

---------07:42----------
that and because I I just my OCD is

---------07:45----------
killing me I'm gonna want to hot air

---------07:47----------
that into place because because I can I

---------07:51----------
know it's it's a [ __ ] I shouldn't be

---------07:54----------
this OCD about everything but I just

---------07:56----------
kind of want to be

---------08:08----------
if this is really not necessary but when

---------08:11----------
there's something called surface tension

---------08:12----------
the cap is going to get pulled into

---------08:14----------
place once the solder pads are both

---------08:17----------
fully molten you'll see the cap is

---------08:19----------
naturally going to fall into place into

---------08:22----------
exactly where the god of solder says it

---------08:25----------
should go

---------08:32----------
oh that's yeah I needed to see that it

---------08:38----------
settles in a place and it's absolutely

---------08:39----------
beautiful so that's about it for that

---------08:42----------
board that's it for today and as always

---------08:44----------
I hope that you learned something about

---------08:46----------
soldering without a hot-air station if

---------08:48----------
you're too broke to have a hot-air

---------08:50----------
station because everybody who starts out

---------08:52----------
in this business usually starts out too

---------08:53----------
broke to have a hot-air station so there

---------08:54----------
you go
