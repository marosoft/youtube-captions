---------00:00----------
all right so let's check out what's

---------00:01----------
wrong with this eight to zero 26:10

---------00:04----------
motherboard another old old core to

---------00:09----------
Shmuel well let's take a look so the

---------00:12----------
first thing I like to do is I always say

---------00:14----------
before turning on the brain is to take a

---------00:15----------
look around the board to see what it

---------00:17----------
looks like get an idea what's going on

---------00:18----------
and when you take a look around this one

---------00:20----------
it looks fairly clean and looks it

---------00:22----------
almost doesn't look like an Apple

---------00:24----------
motherboard because it actually has look

---------00:28----------
oh it's black and white why why you

---------00:30----------
blacken alright so I guess this is my

---------00:31----------
microscopes way of telling me to stop

---------00:33----------
working on really old it's actually

---------00:35----------
black and white I don't know why it's

---------00:37----------
black and white but it's stuck in black

---------00:38----------
and white so as we go around the board

---------00:40----------
you'll see that there's not hmm is it

---------00:44----------
black and white or is it just let's see

---------00:48----------
screwdriver with green yeah it's

---------00:50----------
definitely black and white and so we go

---------00:53----------
around the board here you'll see that

---------00:55----------
it's fairly clean and it doesn't look

---------00:56----------
like it's got any liquid on it doesn't

---------00:58----------
have any signs of liquid damage and the

---------00:59----------
customer said they never got liquid on

---------01:00----------
it which as always is the way they did

---------01:03----------
the undisputed way of telling that they

---------01:05----------
definitely never had water on it cuz why

---------01:07----------
would the customer ever lie they never

---------01:09----------
lie as dr. house would say so the common

---------01:13----------
issue with this board by now is you guys

---------01:14----------
should be aware of if you watch the

---------01:16----------
channel on a regular basis is this see

---------01:17----------
77071

---------01:19----------
this little tantalum capacitor and if we

---------01:22----------
this is for a 1.0 volt power line and if

---------01:26----------
we measure this board you'll see the

---------01:31----------
voltage that we get is gonna be

---------01:32----------
something like three point three one

---------01:36----------
zero and as I always try to demonstrate

---------01:38----------
on this channel when it comes to reflow

---------01:40----------
Inge and Ryu oven Inge and all that

---------01:43----------
watch what happens if we just heat that

---------01:46----------
thing up a little bit so I'm just gonna

---------01:47----------
take my hot air station turn it to one

---------01:50----------
of its highest temperature settings and

---------01:52----------
we're just going to torture this a

---------01:54----------
little bit so we're just gonna take that

---------01:55----------
little capacitor and do this

---------02:04----------
burn baby burn

---------02:20----------
note that this is right next to the mCP

---------02:21----------
by the way see this is the mCP but the

---------02:23----------
heatsink over it all right so we we

---------02:26----------
burned the capacitor a little bit I'm

---------02:28----------
gonna plug the board in right after

---------02:30----------
burning the capacitor because that's a

---------02:31----------
smart thing to do and we're gonna

---------02:34----------
measure that point on the multimeter and

---------02:36----------
what are we gonna get what do you know

---------02:37----------
one point zero nine volts same thing as

---------02:40----------
usual bad tantalum cap that's gotta go

---------02:43----------
and this is why I'm so against the whole

---------02:46----------
reflow oven culture of not figuring

---------02:48----------
things out and as I say it is not it

---------02:53----------
does not it's not the chip it's not the

---------02:56----------
damn chip

---------02:57----------
it's the capacitor next to it but you

---------03:01----------
got to think to figure it out come on

---------03:05----------
get out of here come on move mofo come

---------03:14----------
on come on go away go away yes go away

---------03:27----------
I'm being impatient I kind of want to

---------03:32----------
see what the inside looks like

---------03:38----------
this is what the inside of its Anzalone

---------03:40----------
capacitor looks like if anybody was

---------03:42----------
wondering pretty isn't it

---------03:48----------
okay let's use a soldering iron that's

---------03:51----------
actually made for the wicking that we

---------03:53----------
need to do here this board is so old

---------04:05----------
that it will it's brought my camera into

---------04:07----------
a black and white mode that's old as

---------04:11----------
hell isn't it

---------04:25----------
wick wick all right

---------04:37----------
let's see if I can get the orientation

---------04:39----------
of the capacitor right this time think

---------04:42----------
dumbass me can get the orientation of

---------04:43----------
the capacitor right this time one way to

---------04:47----------
find out

---------04:58----------
we're gonna make myself a little bit of

---------05:00----------
an extension wire over here gonna make

---------05:13----------
we're gonna fit in a proper capacitor a

---------05:19----------
proper capacitor

---------06:06----------
I made a mess

---------06:09----------
don't need all this excess wire no break

---------06:13----------
off break off break off breaker breaker

---------06:56----------
somebody wants me to sign a mousepad who

---------07:05----------
that was interesting

---------07:14----------
you

---------08:02----------
they're gonna move this inductor up

---------08:42----------
give ourselves a little bit more room

---------08:52----------
this wire kind of sucks that wire is

---------08:58----------
garbage take that out of there you can

---------09:00----------
do I don't know what the hell made me

---------09:01----------
think that was a good way to do this a

---------09:08----------
much better way to do this would be with

---------09:11----------
a really let's just take a small little

---------09:15----------
piece of magnet wire sometimes I just

---------09:20----------
sometimes my brains does not not going

---------09:23----------
with me this scratch scratch scratch

---------09:28----------
scrape the magnet wire hey we got it to

---------09:33----------
stick out a little bit No

---------09:50----------
all right

---------10:05----------
okay

---------10:08----------
now let's put the capacitor on with the

---------10:10----------
right right right orientation

---------10:14----------
come here capacitor here we go

---------10:17----------
capacitor you're gonna go over here

---------10:19----------
we're gonna shove you in there

---------10:45----------
damnit the hot air just went off

---------10:54----------
this Auto cool-down thing sucks try to

---------10:58----------
ruin my job

---------11:40----------
okay that'll have to get cleans bud fits

---------11:46----------
it fits yeah what-what are you watching

---------11:49----------
me alright yeah plug it in you wait for

---------11:58----------
the light and the charger you can do it

---------12:06----------
and what do you know another device

---------12:11----------
fixed my unauthorized repair another one

---------12:19----------
and I've went over this and if you watch

---------12:22----------
the last video I did a few days ago with

---------12:23----------
the graphics processor you'll understand

---------12:28----------
this one and it'll make sense that's

---------12:31----------
that for today and as always I hope you

---------12:34----------
learned something and for the love of

---------12:35----------
God solder better than I just did over

---------12:36----------
there that first attempt I made was just

---------12:39----------
really dumb I don't know what I was

---------12:40----------
thinking
