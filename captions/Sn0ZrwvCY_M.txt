---------00:00----------
here we have an a 1707 MacBook Pro

---------00:02----------
that's not turning on let's open this

---------00:03----------
machine up and see if we can figure out

---------00:04----------
why it's not turning on and make it work

---------00:06----------
again make it into a happy little touch

---------00:08----------
bar if such a thing even exists all

---------00:11----------
right so as always the first thing that

---------00:12----------
we typically like to do here is see how

---------00:15----------
much power the board is taking without

---------00:16----------
the batteries so I'm just gonna unplug

---------00:18----------
the battery so that on my USB see ya

---------00:20----------
meter I can see how much power the board

---------00:22----------
is drawing mmm how many Am's does this

---------00:26----------
take all right we're taking 200 80

---------00:29----------
milliamps and it appears that we're

---------00:32----------
stuck at five point one two volts and

---------00:34----------
not moving from there let's try and

---------00:36----------
figure out why we're stuck at five point

---------00:38----------
one two volts and not moving so we're

---------00:40----------
gonna take all the screws out of this

---------00:42----------
machine there's a lot of different T 3

---------00:43----------
and T 5 screws all of different sizes of

---------00:45----------
course this is a MacBook inside the

---------00:47----------
machine we're just gonna unscrew every

---------00:49----------
single one of them looks like we have 43

---------00:51----------
people watching even though there's

---------00:52----------
typically two to five hundred maybe

---------00:55----------
sometimes 700 watching this stream so

---------00:56----------
does the big shout out to youtube for

---------00:58----------
not giving people notifications Paul is

---------01:00----------
actually unable to get to the stream

---------01:01----------
even if he clicks onto the channel the

---------01:03----------
greatness of YouTube okay so we are

---------01:07----------
gonna take all the screws out of this

---------01:08----------
machine and we're gonna make this thing

---------01:11----------
work it's gonna work great

---------01:12----------
beautifully once we're done and

---------01:15----------
hopefully I can show you what it is I

---------01:17----------
did why I did it and you can understand

---------01:19----------
so that you could take one of these

---------01:20----------
machines and make them work again - with

---------01:22----------
the way Apple tells people you got to

---------01:24----------
spend fourteen or fifteen hundred

---------01:25----------
dollars to fix it there's a lot of these

---------01:28----------
that are probably just getting disposed

---------01:29----------
of or tossed out and the real goldmine

---------01:32----------
with these is not even the stuff that's

---------01:33----------
been recycled it's been it's the stuff

---------01:35----------
that's just sitting in someone's night

---------01:37----------
table drawer next to their bed under

---------01:39----------
their bed because they just don't know

---------01:40----------
what to do with it they don't have the

---------01:42----------
money to spend on fixing it based on the

---------01:44----------
price that they think it's gonna cost

---------01:45----------
this untapped market they're just tens

---------01:49----------
of thousands of these machines that are

---------01:51----------
probably sitting dead for silly reasons

---------01:52----------
and if you can figure out how to make

---------01:55----------
them work again and you can find where

---------01:57----------
they are then you can make a little bit

---------02:00----------
of extra money for yourself while also

---------02:04----------
making an owner very happy you're not

---------02:06----------
just the teacher you're also entertainer

---------02:07----------
do the GoFundMe let us enjoy better

---------02:08----------
content thank you very much as you okay

---------02:10----------
so the issue that we have with this

---------02:11----------
machine is that it's sucker five point

---------02:12----------
two volts why stuck at five

---------02:13----------
two votes only taken 200 milliamps it's

---------02:15----------
supposed to be giving us 20 volts and

---------02:20----------
1.5 amps but as you can see it's stuck

---------02:22----------
at five point one two volts twenty

---------02:23----------
hundred eighty million now the first

---------02:24----------
thing we got to do is see if VP 33

---------02:26----------
undersquare j-3 hot as president 53 or

---------02:27----------
3m square G 3 Altis president CD 32 15s

---------02:29----------
won't turn on disease you thirty sees

---------02:30----------
teens don't turn on it means that the

---------02:32----------
charger is not going to go up to 20 volt

---------02:34----------
and it's gonna stay at 5 volts thinking

---------02:35----------
it's a GoPro or a cell phone it's the

---------02:37----------
first thing we got to do here or see if

---------02:38----------
I were getting our rail of PB 3 V 3

---------02:41----------
underscore G 3 hot 1.7 1.8 interesting

---------02:56----------
hmm so P P 3 V 3 underscore G 3 hot is

---------03:00----------
trying to enable itself but it's failing

---------03:02----------
to go all the way up partial short on PP

---------03:04----------
3 V 3 under square G 3 hot perhaps one

---------03:06----------
way to find out let's see if the enable

---------03:10----------
is there we're going to take the

---------03:12----------
schematic in the board view to an 8 - 0

---------03:14----------
- 0 0 to 8 1 and check it out see what

---------03:18----------
we get so that is the enable signal for

---------03:21----------
P P 3 V 3 underscore G 3 hot let's just

---------03:23----------
make sure it's being enabled it probably

---------03:24----------
is just being partially shorted to

---------03:26----------
ground you put the ball in the pocket or

---------03:34----------
else it gets the hose again

---------03:36----------
5 volts enable is present only getting

---------03:41----------
1.8 volts over there hmm let's see what

---------03:46----------
our resistance the ground is on that

---------03:48----------
rail to see why we're only getting 1.8

---------03:50----------
instead of 3.3 a hundred sixty ohms

---------03:56----------
that's not right we have a short-circuit

---------03:58----------
ladies and gentlemen have you ever had a

---------04:03----------
hundred sixty ohms to ground on PP 3 V 3

---------04:05----------
Pole

---------04:09----------
alright let's take a look around the

---------04:11----------
board and see if anything looks nasty

---------04:13----------
it looks dusty it's always possible the

---------04:16----------
dust is covering corrosion it's so much

---------04:19----------
dust absolutely filthy

---------04:27----------
put the ball in the pocket now one

---------04:30----------
hundred sixty ohms wouldn't be that

---------04:32----------
terrible if it was a high voltage like

---------04:34----------
twelve rate the being that's a low

---------04:36----------
voltage like three it's gonna be hard to

---------04:37----------
see anything if it is shorted alright so

---------04:40----------
let's take a look at some homes law

---------04:42----------
calculator so if we have Earthsea 3.3

---------04:46----------
volts at 160 ohms 160 ohms that mean

---------04:51----------
that would take 0.06 watts I'm never

---------04:55----------
gonna see that so injecting voltage to

---------04:58----------
find the short is barely an option here

---------05:00----------
because while that is a short circuit

---------05:02----------
it's not gonna be about putting out

---------05:04----------
enough that I'm gonna be able to

---------05:05----------
visually see it whoa 1 amp

---------05:10----------
how is it taking 1 amp it's at 160 ohms

---------05:13----------
at 3 volts ohms law calculator said

---------05:15----------
according to mr. ohm it's lying sack of

---------05:19----------
 he said that it's gonna be taking

---------05:22----------
point is it's gonna be taking 0.02 amps

---------05:25----------
but when I do this and amp whoa 3.3

---------05:33----------
volts at 160 ohms ohm is a lying sack of

---------05:36----------
crap okay its 3.3 volts at 160 ohms how

---------05:41----------
many watts or amps is the short going to

---------05:44----------
pull

---------05:51----------
okay so something on this board is going

---------05:53----------
to be taking out yeah I saw the dust

---------05:56----------
start to leave one of the chips so what

---------05:58----------
is taking an ampere now also one of the

---------06:01----------
things I want you to get is do you

---------06:02----------
understand why it is that I am looking

---------06:04----------
for PP 3 B 3 underscore G 3 huh

---------06:06----------
so I'm not getting 20 volts in the

---------06:08----------
charger the charge is only putting out 5

---------06:10----------
volts my USBC amp meter that i put

---------06:12----------
between the charger and the machine is

---------06:13----------
what is telling me that it's stuck at 5

---------06:16----------
volts now as to why it is that that

---------06:18----------
matters why is it why is pp 3 2 B 3

---------06:20----------
underscore G 3 hot matter there let's go

---------06:22----------
to the chip that's going to do the

---------06:23----------
actual communication with the with the

---------06:28----------
charger so that's going to be the C D

---------06:29----------
32:15 there's one CD 32:15 it's a USB C

---------06:32----------
port controller as you can read over

---------06:34----------
here and there's one of them per port

---------06:36----------
now if you check out over here you'll

---------06:41----------
see it's this chip gets its power V in

---------06:44----------
voltage in from P P 3 V 3 underscore G 3

---------06:49----------
hot so I went to check that rail and

---------06:50----------
when I check the rail that's when I

---------06:53----------
noticed that it was 1.8 volts rather

---------06:56----------
than 3.3 volts now as it says in the

---------06:58----------
little instruction manual I post in the

---------07:00----------
bottom all my videos when you're not

---------07:02----------
missing a power rail is it being enabled

---------07:04----------
we have five volts the enable check is

---------07:06----------
the chip bad it's always possible but

---------07:09----------
not sure yet is it being shorted to

---------07:11----------
ground let's see that because it's

---------07:12----------
easier to see if it's shorted to ground

---------07:13----------
than it is to try another trip we did

---------07:15----------
and we saw it's 160 ohms which means

---------07:17----------
something on the line has to be shorted

---------07:18----------
so what I decided to do the way your

---------07:20----------
short to ground works

---------07:21----------
short to ground when they say Oh what is

---------07:22----------
something is short rather than the

---------07:24----------
electricity making its way all the way

---------07:25----------
around the circuit is that one of the

---------07:27----------
things that's connected to ground shorts

---------07:29----------
so instead of it making all the way over

---------07:31----------
here something is connecting the ground

---------07:33----------
more than it should so instead of the

---------07:35----------
power making its way all the way through

---------07:37----------
the circuit this one thing shoves it all

---------07:39----------
the ground now electricity and is

---------07:42----------
essentially energy energy is heat so if

---------07:45----------
what I could do here is I could take 3.3

---------07:48----------
volts or my power supply something much

---------07:50----------
stronger than that little chip on

---------07:51----------
the board you know this thing over here

---------07:53----------
what do you think is more powerful this

---------07:56----------
power supply that I have over here this

---------07:58----------
thing that weighs like 10 pounds or that

---------08:01----------
teeny tiny little chip on the

---------08:03----------
board obviously it's going to be the

---------08:04----------
power

---------08:05----------
supply so I tell the power supply to put

---------08:07----------
3.3 volts into the rail I attach the

---------08:09----------
grounds of the power supply to the

---------08:10----------
grounds of the board and whatever it is

---------08:12----------
on the board that is causing my

---------08:15----------
short-circuit is gonna get really hot

---------08:16----------
because remember electricity is energy

---------08:18----------
energy is heat so then I use the heat to

---------08:20----------
figure out what the problem is this is

---------08:22----------
actually how I met Jesse Jones at CTIA

---------08:23----------
we were the two people there that both

---------08:25----------
used our face to fight shorts in the

---------08:27----------
board

---------08:28----------
we're the only two in the room that

---------08:29----------
we're doing that and that's how we

---------08:31----------
started a friendship now well Paul was

---------08:34----------
up there I noticed that on this very

---------08:36----------
disgusting filthy board that one of

---------08:38----------
these chips actually are the dust start

---------08:39----------
leaving it and I'm gonna show you which

---------08:41----------
one that is so today just in case you

---------08:43----------
don't have a high end thermal camera

---------08:44----------
because I'm constantly showing you how

---------08:45----------
this works on a high end thermal cam

---------08:47----------
we're gonna show you how to find the

---------08:49----------
short using something that's really

---------08:51----------
cheap liquid like alcohol all right so

---------08:54----------
what we're gonna do here is we're going

---------08:55----------
to turn the power supply off enjoy this

---------08:57----------
and you speak it right to repair hearing

---------08:59----------
intelligence is amazing thank you very

---------09:00----------
much how you remind me but no thank you

---------09:05----------
for getting that song stuck back in my

---------09:06----------
head that's evil so I'm gonna turn off

---------09:09----------
the power supply for a second and I

---------09:12----------
think it was right over here so now what

---------09:15----------
we do is we put the alcohol over the

---------09:16----------
chips and put the light all the way up

---------09:19----------
and you should be able to see when I

---------09:21----------
turn it on which chip it is and it's the

---------09:25----------
one on the left you see how the alcohol

---------09:26----------
is evaporating from the chip on the Left

---------09:28----------
far more than the chip on the right the

---------09:31----------
next thing that we're gonna do here to

---------09:33----------
see if that's the thing that's wrong is

---------09:34----------
we're gonna take Steve's finger and

---------09:36----------
we're gonna put it on the chip touch the

---------09:37----------
chip so it looks like our CD 32:15 is

---------09:40----------
what's wrong and oh my god look at that

---------09:41----------
there's some green dust right there so

---------09:42----------
you see how the pubic hair is in this

---------09:44----------
area you have little bits of green by

---------09:45----------
them those little bits of green are

---------09:47----------
likely corrosion so maybe some water a

---------09:49----------
humidity made its way in there see those

---------09:52----------
are green pubes alright so we're gonna

---------09:57----------
do now is we're gonna replace that CD

---------09:59----------
3215 if you need a CD 3215 by the way if

---------10:03----------
anybody was curious as to where it is

---------10:05----------
they could get a CD 3215 while I ready

---------10:07----------
the board for one getrekt ad buck this

remember just enough

---------11:22----------
now before we do something stupid we're

---------11:25----------
gonna see if the short is gone 15

---------11:30----------
kilohms that's much better than we had

---------11:33----------
before which was a hundred sixty ohms

---------11:36----------
then again just as I said there's no

---------11:40----------
reason to trust mr. ohm

---------11:41----------
mr. ohm did us dirty there's no rhyme or

---------11:47----------
reason for why mr. homn did us so dirty

---------11:51----------
supposed to take 0.02 or 6 watts or amps

---------11:54----------
and the thing is taking away more don't

---------11:59----------
make a damn bit of sense Paul even

---------12:01----------
double check my math did you ever expect

---------12:09----------
ohm to let you down like that Paul I

---------12:11----------
[Music]

---------12:18----------
like my meter

---------12:19----------
it never gets anything wrong I ever

---------12:24----------
appealed Ohm's law is a

---------12:31----------
ohm is dead

---------12:39----------
maybe that could be the merge that we

---------12:40----------
get a set of multimeters that use like

---------12:42----------
Paul's law or something every way if you

---------12:50----------
use a q-tip instead of a clean room

---------12:52----------
thingy that you turn it around over and

---------12:55----------
over other than back and forth this way

---------12:57----------
if any of the hairs come off they still

---------12:59----------
kind of getting wrapped around the q-tip

---------13:10----------
put a little bit of flux this is the

---------13:14----------
right amount of flux I'm not using more

---------13:17----------
flux than I should because my store my

---------13:19----------
online store that sells flux is going to

---------13:21----------
help fund the new store location we're

---------13:22----------
moving to I would never do something

---------13:23----------
like that we're using the right amount

---------13:27----------
of flux Paul is getting with the program

---------13:35----------
Paul understands that a proper desk an

---------13:40----------
even floor

---------13:42----------
light fixtures that allow you to see

---------13:45----------
things properly but you know floor

---------13:46----------
that's actually true level as Rick and

---------13:48----------
Morty would say wow it's so oh my god oh

---------13:57----------
Christ

---------13:58----------
yeah true level morning come on

---------14:01----------
we're leaving for school reality is

---------14:05----------
poison what's his deal can't fund that

---------14:10----------
if we're selling honest amounts of flux

---------14:12----------
but you got to sell an Adam Newman

---------14:14----------
amount of flux oh yeah look at that look

---------14:16----------
at that chip that chip is stacked as

---------14:19----------
high as we works debt are you invested

---------14:25----------
in soft Bank Paul

---------14:29----------
it's good to know that some people make

---------14:30----------
even stupider investments than I did

---------14:52----------
I never bought into the we work thing I

---------14:54----------
was meeting people in the park in 2009

---------14:56----------
and 10 in Herald Square probably just

---------14:59----------
travel to them if there's no point in

---------15:01----------
paying 2 to 700 bucks for a desk when I

---------15:03----------
have no dignity and I'm sharing the

---------15:04----------
space with hundreds upon hundreds of

---------15:06----------
people at that point I'm better

---------15:08----------
literally better off just having a table

---------15:10----------
at a park

---------15:24----------
30 milliamps is being used when I inject

---------15:27----------
3.3 into the board that's a good thing

---------15:30----------
how short is gone now I'm going to just

---------15:33----------
desolder that wire that I put on the PP

---------15:38----------
3v3 creation point and we are gonna see

---------15:49----------
if this works before Paul ultrasonic

---------15:51----------
something paul's a selfish bastard he

---------15:55----------
wants to do his job but if he uses the

---------15:57----------
ultrasonic cleaner it screws up my

---------15:59----------
microphone one of millions of problems

---------16:01----------
that will be solved if I get a new

---------16:02----------
location why can't we put the old row

---------16:04----------
sonica yeah good times let's see what

---------16:11----------
happens here do you turn on or do you go

---------16:14----------
to Paul alright so the boot sequence is

---------16:16----------
proper using 20 milliamps on five volts

---------16:18----------
then 20 volts at one point to two amps

---------16:22----------
see that that's a proper looking boot

---------16:24----------
sequence there see let's just plug it in

---------16:30----------
the other port

---------16:42----------
as what happens when I can ultrasonic

---------16:45----------
something

---------16:59----------
so that is the proper boot sequence

---------17:00----------
there we go we fixed our problem we had

---------17:02----------
a short circuit aground on the power

---------17:03----------
will require for powering the cd32 15

---------17:05----------
that's going to talk to the charger and

---------17:06----------
tell the charger it's about 20 volt

---------17:08----------
instead of 5 we cleared our short

---------17:09----------
circuit we found our short circuit by

---------17:11----------
checking for the

---------17:58----------
raising the Rangers

---------18:00----------
[Applause]

---------18:04----------
so it looks like we had a short-circuit

---------18:06----------
aground on PP 3300 scourge III hunt

---------18:08----------
that's the power eletric wired for the

---------18:09----------
cd32 15 to speak to the charger 16 is

---------18:12----------
the chip that is he called a USBC port

---------18:14----------
controller and the charger is not going

---------18:16----------
to be at 20 volts it's gonna be a 5 volt

---------18:19----------
until it speaks to the computer and

---------18:20----------
realizes that it's a MacBook and not a

---------18:21----------
GoPro it would suck if a USBC charger

---------18:24----------
decided to send 20 volts to your phone

---------18:25----------
or 20 volts to a gopro so there needs to

---------18:27----------
be that basic communication first and

---------18:29----------
that communication is not going to

---------18:30----------
happen if the cd32 15 is not powering on

---------18:31----------
the cdc 15 is not powering on because

---------18:34----------
people are three underscore g3 how is

---------18:35----------
missing

---------18:36----------
these PPP three underscore g3 hot is the

---------18:38----------
primary power rail responsible for

---------18:40----------
powering the CD 32 15 s now when we went

---------18:42----------
to take a look at the PP 30 before 300

---------18:44----------
square G 300 signal was present on pin

---------18:46----------
10 were getting five point one volts

---------18:48----------
there from the ISO nine to 39 however we

---------18:50----------
were only getting 1.8 volts in output

---------18:51----------
when we check to see what the impedance

---------18:53----------
the ground was an output we're getting a

---------18:54----------
hundred sixty ohms which it doesn't mean

---------18:56----------
a short to ground so we decided to do is

---------18:58----------
inject 3.3 volts from external power

---------19:00----------
