---------00:00----------
alright this already turns on so let's

---------00:03----------
see what's wrong with this machine what

---------00:07----------
could this be here for today hmm no

---------00:13----------
light on the screen let's see do we get

---------00:15----------
a picture so first thing to do here is

---------00:18----------
see if we get a picture so I'm going to

---------00:23----------
admit to that by measuring the LCD

---------00:25----------
connector at pins 28 29 and 30 let's see

---------00:30----------
if we get 5 volts

---------00:42----------
and there's no five volts at the LCD

---------00:44----------
connector so let's see if it's being

---------00:46----------
told to turn on so the LCD enable line

---------00:49----------
is going to be pin 1 on you 9000 which

---------00:52----------
is zero point zero zero two volts so

---------00:57----------
five volts in and obviously zero volts

---------00:59----------
out okay so why is the LCD not being

---------01:02----------
told to turn on here what if I press on

---------01:05----------
the board do we have a GPU V core that's

---------01:08----------
something to check for so let's open up

---------01:10----------
the schematic and see if we've got GPU V

---------01:12----------
core

---------01:12----------
all right I want to see if my GPU V core

---------01:15----------
is present so that's going to be and I

---------01:19----------
get nothing

---------01:20----------
I have no picture on the screen and I

---------01:23----------
measure to see if there was voltage

---------01:24----------
going to the screen on the chip called u

---------01:26----------
9000 so this is the page for the LCD

---------01:30----------
panel this is the LCD connector now the

---------01:32----------
LCD panel needs to get 5 volts on right

---------01:36----------
over here PP 5v whatever unpinch 28 29

---------01:39----------
and 32 turn on and I measured zero volts

---------01:42----------
there u 9000 when turned on when LCD

---------01:45----------
power enable is going to it's on pin

---------01:47----------
will allow PP 5v which is a 5 volt rail

---------01:50----------
to flow to V out pins 4 and 5 this is a

---------01:54----------
buck controller for creating PPV core

---------01:57----------
SLE graphics reg u 8900 which is located

---------02:04----------
right over here but we're going to do is

---------02:07----------
we're going to use my micro pencil with

---------02:09----------
the t30 - KN tip and I'm going to

---------02:11----------
surround this with some flux

---------02:18----------
and now I'm going to run through and add

---------02:23----------
some nice new leaded solder over here

---------02:26----------
make sure that I get each individual pin

---------02:29----------
of the qfn package

---------03:21----------
we slide right through

---------03:44----------
now I'm going to add a little bit more

---------03:46----------
flux to the general area

---------03:55----------
and just in case anything else other

---------03:57----------
than that was our problem so now what

---------04:01----------
I'm going to do is I'm going to give

---------04:02----------
this entire area localized reflow so in

---------04:07----------
addition to redoing the solder on the

---------04:09----------
qfn it's going to get anything else in

---------04:12----------
that area that they have been been to

---------04:14----------
seen some impact

---------04:50----------
now we're going to give it a moment of

---------04:51----------
dry

---------05:01----------
exposure is a little too high there

---------05:06----------
and that's way too much exposure come on

---------05:08----------
turn down I haven't seen that much

---------05:10----------
exposure since vice offered me a TV

---------05:11----------
contract

---------05:18----------
so now we're going to I'm going to get

---------05:20----------
the multimeter back on and we're going

---------05:21----------
to see if we get GPU V core I just I'm

---------05:24----------
going to plug in the screen and we'll

---------05:29----------
see if we get a light picture all that

---------05:32----------
good stuff alright we're going to plug

---------05:34----------
it in you've got our moment of truth so

---------05:37----------
we have a picture a backlight and GPU

---------05:39----------
vcore as can be seen here we have zero

---------05:45----------
point eight eight nine volts of GPU v

---------05:48----------
core

---------05:48----------
I haven't light there's a light on the

---------05:52----------
screen and in a minute you're going to

---------05:53----------
be able to see a question mark and once

---------05:55----------
we see the question mark will be said

---------06:02----------
tada

---------06:04----------
question mark fold oh so that is how we

---------06:08----------
fixed the signature problem with no

---------06:10----------
video in the 2012 and 2013 15 inch

---------06:13----------
retina MacBook Pros before I finish for

---------06:15----------
the day I just want to explain why it is

---------06:18----------
I find this program that Apple has to be

---------06:20----------
particularly detestable so if we were to

---------06:22----------
look at this page this program ends on

---------06:24----------
December 31st 2016 they call it a repair

---------06:27----------
extension program and they also say they

---------06:29----------
determined that a small percentage of

---------06:31----------
systems may exhibit and if you google

---------06:33----------
search on the internet and a small

---------06:35----------
percentage it's a lot of people and the

---------06:38----------
issue that I have with this is that

---------06:39----------
there was no effort made to email people

---------06:42----------
to reach out to people that had this

---------06:45----------
issue that registered their machines

---------06:46----------
there was no effort made to put this on

---------06:48----------
the front page of the website so that

---------06:49----------
people knew hey it Temba 31st was coming

---------06:52----------
don't you want to make sure if you have

---------06:53----------
this machine that you can get the board

---------06:54----------
fixed before the extended warranty is up

---------06:56----------
no most people who come here and have no

---------06:58----------
idea that this program ever existed and

---------07:00----------
frankly if you don't Google you've got a

---------07:02----------
lot of digging to do on Apple's website

---------07:03----------
to ever figure out that this is an issue

---------07:05----------
unlike most manufacturers that when they

---------07:08----------
have some type of serious issue with

---------07:09----------
their products well make sure to put it

---------07:11----------
on the news section of their website or

---------07:12----------
release some type of service bulletins

---------07:14----------
that everybody can see Apple kind of

---------07:16----------
digs it really deep in their website and

---------07:18----------
it's my opinion and I could be wrong and

---------07:21----------
I state I used the word opinion very

---------07:23----------
carefully because I know that from

---------07:24----------
Kilpatrick and Townsend said last year

---------07:27----------
that they watch my channel and their

---------07:28----------
fans so just in case any one of my

---------07:30----------
favorite

---------07:31----------
they're watching my channel today I just

---------07:33----------
want to make sure that I use the word

---------07:34----------
opinion that you can't do any funny

---------07:37----------
business but it is my opinion that Apple

---------07:40----------
does not want people with these problems

---------07:42----------
going to the store to get these boards

---------07:44----------
fixed Apple doesn't want their tech

---------07:46----------
support to you filled up with their own

---------07:48----------
problems that they are responsible for

---------07:50----------
and they just want you to play a new one

---------07:52----------
they're just hoping that you're going to

---------07:53----------
forget about this and that is going to

---------07:55----------
fail outside the warranty period and

---------07:57----------
then they could do the bare minimum

---------07:58----------
required to not get sued and get away

---------08:00----------
with it and often sadly they succeed and

---------08:03----------
to me in my opinion that's a fairly

---------08:06----------
shitty thing to do to people that spend

---------08:08----------
3000 or 4000 dollars in your product

---------08:10----------
when they could have spent 1,000 or

---------08:11----------
2,000 someone else's they're not going

---------08:13----------
to tell you and there's a flaw but if

---------08:15----------
you stay subscribe to this channel

---------08:16----------
you'll get to learn every single

---------08:17----------
signature flaw as we figure them out and

---------08:19----------
we will figure them out and if you want

---------08:22----------
us to find out where it is you can learn

---------08:23----------
more you can check out our forum over

---------08:25----------
here where we are regularly walking

---------08:27----------
people through all of these different

---------08:29----------
types of problems this is free to view

---------08:32----------
and $29 a month to post so if you have a

---------08:34----------
business and you're doing any type of

---------08:35----------
MacBook component-level board repair and

---------08:37----------
you're just starting to make money at it

---------08:39----------
but you kind of getting confused with

---------08:40----------
some of your problems we are not not to

---------08:43----------
have you know go on an ego trip we're

---------08:44----------
pretty good at this we will figure out

---------08:46----------
over the internet what's wrong with your

---------08:48----------
board will tell you what to measure will

---------08:49----------
tell you where the where the corrosion

---------08:51----------
is and very often people who follow our

---------08:54----------
advice will end up with 6 motherboards

---------08:56----------
and if you don't do this is a business

---------08:57----------
and you're just kind of curious you can

---------08:59----------
check it out it's free to look at and

---------09:01----------
it's always free to watch the videos in

---------09:02----------
this channel we will demonstrate from

---------09:04----------
start to finish just like we did today

---------09:05----------
how you can diagnose these issues you

---------09:08----------
can figure out that your issue matches

---------09:09----------
the one in the video and how you can

---------09:11----------
repair the problem without any type of

---------09:14----------
fancy schmancy editing out all the good

---------09:16----------
stuff so that you don't know what to do

---------09:17----------
I really hope that people who watch this

---------09:19----------
channel and who read the forum are able

---------09:21----------
to make these broken products work again

---------09:22----------
I really hope that you go out there and

---------09:24----------
find all of these eight 1398 2012 and

---------09:27----------
2013 machines that are sitting in

---------09:29----------
landfills recycling centers aways

---------09:31----------
facilities or just in somebody's

---------09:32----------
nitrogen just somebody's night table

---------09:34----------
drawer that they're just close to

---------09:36----------
throwing away and that you make them

---------09:38----------
work again so that somebody else could

---------09:39----------
be happy using it that's the point of

---------09:41----------
this channel and I really like seeing in

---------09:43----------
the comments when people say hey I

---------09:45----------
this exact same problem and now I fixed

---------09:47----------
it that's awesome and I want to see more

---------09:49----------
of that

---------09:49----------
so find these machines make them work

---------09:51----------
again make the video come on again and

---------09:53----------
let me know how it went

---------09:54----------
thanks for watching and as always I hope

---------09:56----------
you learned something
