---------00:00----------
alright so today we're going to go over

---------00:01----------
an 820 3462 board that has no power

---------00:04----------
after a keyboard replacement and as you

---------00:06----------
can see to make Eli hush I have gotten

---------00:12----------
rid of the grape let's see if it affects

---------00:14----------
audio quality now let's first thing to

---------00:17----------
do here is see what it does when you

---------00:18----------
plug in the power adapter so I'm going

---------00:22----------
to plug in the power adapter and there's

---------00:26----------
no light now the one wire circuit is

---------00:30----------
what's responsible for creating a green

---------00:31----------
light in the charger now for those of

---------00:33----------
you who've been watching this video

---------00:35----------
series for a while you should know that

---------00:37----------
you need PP 3v4 to underscore g3 hot to

---------00:39----------
be present in order to have a green

---------00:40----------
light in the charger if you have been

---------00:42----------
watching for a while watch the one wire

---------00:43----------
series videos it's about 11 10 minute

---------00:46----------
video that really sums up how that whole

---------00:48----------
thing works so let's switch an open

---------00:50----------
broadcaster as you can see they have

---------00:52----------
these really cool transitions now see

---------00:56----------
that oh that is amazing I got spoiled

---------00:58----------
buds open broadcaster is great software

---------01:00----------
if you like these videos you should

---------01:02----------
donate to the open broadcaster project

---------01:04----------
because they just keep making it better

---------01:05----------
and adding features when there's really

---------01:06----------
nothing in it for them to be doing so I

---------01:09----------
gave them a hundred bucks a while back I

---------01:11----------
should probably give them more it would

---------01:13----------
be impossible to do these videos

---------01:14----------
regularly without something that

---------01:16----------
actually works like that so p b3 b4 to

---------01:19----------
underscore g3 hot is going to be created

---------01:21----------
by you 6990 so let's check out where you

---------01:24----------
6990 zap

---------01:37----------
well I'm not hit I'm hitting next page

---------01:39----------
not next result don't however see this

---------01:45----------
this is the one wire circuit this is

---------01:47----------
what's going to allow the charger which

---------01:48----------
is plugging into this dcn board over

---------01:50----------
here to talk to the SMC this chip is

---------01:53----------
powered by smc bc AC okay VCC which

---------01:56----------
comes from this trip which is powered by

---------01:58----------
PP three before two so if I have no

---------01:59----------
green light first thing to do is check

---------02:01----------
that PP 3d 42 is working and it seems

---------02:03----------
like we can check for PP three before

---------02:04----------
two over here on L 6995 that's an

---------02:07----------
inductor that's going to be smoothing

---------02:08----------
out the switching power supplies so this

---------02:10----------
is taking either PP budge d3 hot which

---------02:13----------
is going to be coming in from the

---------02:14----------
battery which is 12 volts on this

---------02:15----------
machine the schematic is stupid and

---------02:17----------
mistaking it for 18 point 5 volts don't

---------02:19----------
get confused by that this is supposed to

---------02:20----------
be 12 or the dcn word which is 18.5

---------02:23----------
volts so let's check l69 95 and see we

---------02:28----------
get so you can I do some pretty oh you

---------02:31----------
can do some pretty cool transitions here

---------02:33----------
so I can find it right over here first

---------02:38----------
thing to do is adjust this so that it's

---------02:42----------
in better focus

---------02:51----------
okay it's in focus for me now let's make

---------03:02----------
sure it's in focus for you alright so

---------03:06----------
that is l 69 and 5c L 6995 over here l

---------03:22----------
69 and five over here it's the first

---------03:24----------
thing I'm going to do is check and see

---------03:25----------
if there's a short to ground there so

---------03:27----------
let's just show you on the multimeter

---------03:28----------
how I do that mem I gotta get used to my

---------03:31----------
shortcuts so I'm going to do here is I'm

---------03:35----------
going to take the red probe and put it

---------03:38----------
on ground and the black probe and put it

---------03:41----------
on where pp3 v42 is and the multi meter

---------03:46----------
reads zero so if I do this you might be

---------03:50----------
able to see that it reads zero that

---------03:53----------
means that this is zero voltage drop

---------03:54----------
across these two probes so the way this

---------03:56----------
works is when I put the multimeter to

---------03:57----------
this ohms symbol over here i have it set

---------04:00----------
to ohms which you may not be able to see

---------04:02----------
and then I click this little yellow

---------04:04----------
button until I get to a diode symbol at

---------04:06----------
the top that's diode mode this and I get

---------04:10----------
a zero so that means that the zero

---------04:12----------
voltage drop across the points obviously

---------04:14----------
because they're touching and what I'm

---------04:15----------
doing over here under the microscope

---------04:17----------
taking the red probe and putting it on

---------04:19----------
you know some kind of screw holder

---------04:21----------
grommet or metal piece that is in like

---------04:23----------
casing like this and then I'm taking the

---------04:26----------
black probe and I'm putting it over here

---------04:28----------
on the inductor now that means that

---------04:31----------
there's a short to ground now the first

---------04:33----------
question that I'm going to have here is

---------04:35----------
those transitions are beautiful is what

---------04:37----------
side is the short on so is the short to

---------04:39----------
ground on my system side where pp3 v42

---------04:42----------
is going to the rest of the computer or

---------04:44----------
is it before the inductor could it be

---------04:46----------
this chip that shorting could be one of

---------04:47----------
these something over here that short so

---------04:49----------
the first thing I'm going to do to try

---------04:50----------
to isolate where the short actually is

---------04:52----------
in this scenario is I'm going to remove

---------04:56----------
the inductor using my hot air station

---------05:02----------
so that means turning on the air filter

---------05:04----------
because i don't like breathing and crap

---------05:07----------
so we do that let's remove the inductor

---------05:11----------
so the air on here is set a little high

---------05:13----------
and it set it to 54 i'm going to set the

---------05:17----------
temperature to 400 celsius bonus points

---------05:25----------
if i don't burn that keyboard backlight

---------05:28----------
connector I think that's what that's for

---------05:42----------
so the inductor is now removed so what

---------05:44----------
I'm going to do is I'm going to see

---------05:45----------
which side my short is on so let's go

---------05:48----------
back here we just rotate this so that it

---------05:53----------
matches out its loud rotate it so it

---------05:55----------
matches what is on the way the board is

---------05:59----------
I've lost the board now great that means

---------06:02----------
i have to reopen this this software

---------06:04----------
sucks so bad here we go where was my

---------06:08----------
inductor my inductor was right over you

---------06:12----------
so the system side is the top and the

---------06:16----------
chip side is the bottom so this over

---------06:19----------
here number one that's this over here

---------06:22----------
and the top is where pp3 be 42 is going

---------06:25----------
to go to the system so now we're going

---------06:28----------
to check which side my short is on so

---------06:32----------
again black is going to go here so let's

---------06:36----------
see is the system side has a short and

---------06:38----------
then on the side that's creating p b3 b4

---------06:42----------
to does not have a short so what this

---------06:44----------
means is that there is a short circuit

---------06:46----------
somewhere over here anywhere in the

---------06:51----------
computer actually anywhere a PP three

---------06:52----------
before two is present so what i can do

---------06:54----------
is something like this so i know that my

---------06:56----------
short is going to be 0 somewhere where p

---------06:59----------
b3 b4 to underscore g3 oddest present so

---------07:01----------
it can be any one of the components that

---------07:03----------
or probe points that just popped up it

---------07:05----------
can be that pin it can be something over

---------07:07----------
here or something over there something

---------07:08----------
over there hope to god not any one of

---------07:11----------
them many many points over here on the

---------07:13----------
other side of the board it could be many

---------07:15----------
different things so the way I'm going to

---------07:16----------
figure out where my short is is through

---------07:19----------
a little bit of fun so what I'm going to

---------07:21----------
do is set my power supply here up so

---------07:25----------
that i can find the short so what i do

---------07:28----------
on this power supply is i'm going to set

---------07:29----------
the current to the maximum current that

---------07:31----------
it's able to provide which is 10.23 a

---------07:34----------
Thames which is really not needed and

---------07:35----------
I'm going to set the voltage 2.5 volts

---------07:38----------
now I'm going to take the power supply

---------07:40----------
wire and I'm going to solder the ground

---------07:48----------
the ground and the positive of the power

---------07:50----------
supply to the pp 3 V 4 to terminal and

---------07:53----------
i'm going to send three point 42 volts

---------07:54----------
to the machine

---------07:55----------
on the three-point 42 volt line now

---------07:58----------
since the computer is actually this is

---------08:01----------
the motherboard itself so there's some

---------08:04----------
component on here that is completing the

---------08:05----------
circuit to ground when I do that

---------08:09----------
whatever component it is is going to get

---------08:11----------
nice and hot and it will give away the

---------08:13----------
fact that it sits bet that's the idea

---------08:16----------
here let's see if that's how it works

---------08:18----------
out

---------08:54----------
I really shouldn't be using a micro

---------08:55----------
pencil for this I just don't feel like

---------08:56----------
switching the irons

---------09:25----------
and now for the fun part we turn it on

---------09:28----------
and it's drawing 0.1 amps at point 5

---------09:32----------
volts which is I am never going to feel

---------09:35----------
what's getting hot so I'm going to turn

---------09:37----------
it up 2 volts at points exams that's

---------09:40----------
about a wat by Ohm's law that's still

---------09:42----------
I'm not going to feel that at all so

---------09:44----------
since it's not really drawing a lot I

---------09:46----------
don't feel bad turning it all the way up

---------09:48----------
to three-point 42 volts 3.42 3 volts at

---------09:53----------
point nine ms that's almost 3 watts at

---------09:55----------
this point I stand the fighting chance

---------09:57----------
at actually finding what it is that is

---------09:58----------
shorted so we're going to feel around

---------10:01----------
the board here move microscope out of

---------10:05----------
the way for a second I put the

---------10:07----------
multimeter where it's comfortable for me

---------10:09----------
I was putting it there so you could see

---------10:10----------
it in the video but it's really a pain

---------10:12----------
in the ass for me to have it over there

---------10:14----------
put it right over here where I like it

---------10:19----------
now I've learned my lesson on on feeling

---------10:25----------
the board with the side of my face the

---------10:26----------
side of your face is a sensitive part of

---------10:28----------
sensitive piece of skin but the same you

---------10:31----------
know I may want the side of my face some

---------10:33----------
day you know that may come in useful

---------10:35----------
might go on a date or something you

---------10:38----------
never know so I'm going to put a little

---------10:39----------
paper towel on my desk and I'm going to

---------10:44----------
pour some cheap-ass alcohol on the board

---------10:46----------
and we'll see if anything sizzles and if

---------10:48----------
something sizzles then I have an answer

---------11:00----------
now the other thing i do is i keep my my

---------11:03----------
board view open using the Nets feature

---------11:05----------
where i can see every point that PP

---------11:07----------
three before two shows up so that I you

---------11:10----------
know I kind of know where to look for

---------11:12----------
the alcohol to be to be sparking or

---------11:14----------
doing something funny it gives me a

---------11:17----------
little bit of context now what I notice

---------11:21----------
on this side of the board is that

---------11:22----------
there's pretty much nothing that's

---------11:24----------
drawing anything so I'm going to turn it

---------11:27----------
around now we check the other side and

---------11:30----------
we see where we go from there

---------11:51----------
and it appeared is that nothing is

---------11:54----------
getting warm not even close that kind of

---------12:03----------
sucks

---------12:10----------
yeah nothing is making the alcohol

---------12:12----------
bubble I hey looking like an idiot on

---------12:18----------
camera but it is what it is so there is

---------12:24----------
clearly as a short to ground zero

---------12:27----------
voltage drop here and this is set to not

---------12:33----------
limit current then we are delivering

---------12:35----------
about 3 watts I mean 3 watts is

---------12:38----------
something you know you should be able to

---------12:40----------
feel 3 watts on this board I would never

---------12:42----------
deliver 3 watts to an iphone but you

---------12:44----------
know this is a larger bored so I feel

---------12:45----------
safe with it three wats should be

---------12:49----------
something where it's like oh it's

---------12:52----------
obviously this because I can feel it

---------12:54----------
burning my finger this is one of those

---------13:02----------
things that FLIR cam might actually be

---------13:04----------
useful but I feel like spending my god

---------13:08----------
I'm a little bit self like one way or

---------13:10----------
the other will get solved it's just a

---------13:13----------
question of whether it's a pain in the

---------13:14----------
ass or not so this is where we go into

---------13:16----------
the microscope when we start

---------13:18----------
investigating alright so let's

---------13:23----------
investigate under the microscope see if

---------13:29----------
anything looks like it's burned away the

---------13:32----------
alcohol and I'm going to pour it into a

---------13:40----------
little cup and just pour a little bit

---------13:41----------
more alcohol you may think this is a

---------13:47----------
waste of alcohol but wait to see how

---------13:48----------
much fries break costs 20 bucks a can

---------13:53----------
 that okay so we have nothing over

---------13:58----------
there remember there is no PP three

---------13:59----------
before two components over there so over

---------14:01----------
here this on PP 3v 42 and again 3 watts

---------14:05----------
you would see that burning away quickly

---------14:08----------
keyboard connector not even close all

---------14:15----------
right so I'm looking at my board view

---------14:16----------
i'm looking at my board view see where

---------14:18----------
else there's some PP three before two so

---------14:20----------
next to this up looking battery

---------14:22----------
connector there's some PP three before

---------14:23----------
two

---------14:24----------
were there nothing okay and then we have

---------14:29----------
this upper right corner over here where

---------14:32----------
there is a load of pp 3 B 4 20 we smell

---------14:36----------
all over there and yeah 3 watts would

---------14:40----------
burn that away really fast and there is

---------14:43----------
no burning away that I can see okay so

---------14:47----------
we had space bar that space bar now move

---------14:51----------
over to the other side of the board and

---------14:53----------
let's take a look see if anything is

---------14:55----------
getting delivered there so you have some

---------15:01----------
PP three before two above over here yeah

---------15:07----------
and then I'll call is not even close to

---------15:08----------
it burned away some over here on this

---------15:13----------
little piece but nothing no dice some on

---------15:24----------
the bottom of the board over here and

---------15:26----------
huh what are you what are you you little

---------15:33----------
burn mofo I know what you are you're

---------15:36----------
resistor that leads up to the pp 3 42

---------15:38----------
power supply but you don't have a path

---------15:42----------
to ground so WTF you look dirty sure but

---------15:48----------
I don't really care about you you

---------15:54----------
wouldn't cause a short to ground so the

---------15:56----------
REE why am I saying that would not cause

---------15:57----------
a short to ground so with that over

---------15:59----------
there is this thing over here to this

---------16:02----------
this is a resistor in between the dcn

---------16:06----------
board and the dial that leads up to the

---------16:10----------
pp 3 V 4 to power creation chip so that

---------16:12----------
that can't possibly be what's shorting

---------16:14----------
anything to ground I mean it doesn't

---------16:16----------
have a path to ground that would be

---------16:17----------
silly so we continue moving around the

---------16:20----------
board and okay so this is giving me a

---------16:24----------
little bit of a hint right here this is

---------16:26----------
a greater hint so there this chip

---------16:29----------
doesn't ah this is yeah this is where it

---------16:34----------
gets tricky

---------16:36----------
so in this specific schematic there is

---------16:39----------
pp 3 V 4 2 i'm sure where there is pp 3

---------16:45----------
4 done looking at the wrong section and

---------16:47----------
PP three before two does actually go

---------16:49----------
into this trip and what is that little

---------16:51----------
mark on top of it what's that what's

---------16:53----------
that that a freckle could that be a

---------16:56----------
freckle or a beauty mark or is that a

---------16:58----------
sign that that is hmm hmm and

---------17:03----------
let's see on the on the board view over

---------17:06----------
here so if I disick and here we go so

---------17:08----------
yeah I mean this that what I'm looking

---------17:11----------
at right over here is this so there's a

---------17:13----------
pin on this chip that gets PP three

---------17:16----------
before two and if you look over here my

---------17:18----------
little mark on that ship man this is a

---------17:21----------
this is a [ __ ] is right in the area

---------17:24----------
where that pin it so this is where the

---------17:26----------
pin is over here see that the the third

---------17:29----------
one on the upper left and then right

---------17:32----------
over here you got a little burn mark so

---------17:34----------
here's what I'm going to do I'm going to

---------17:35----------
keep the power going into the board

---------17:37----------
right now right I'm going to keep the

---------17:39----------
power going to the board what I'm going

---------17:40----------
to do is I'm going to remove that chip

---------17:42----------
and I want to see if the power supply

---------17:45----------
stops delivering power to the board I'm

---------17:47----------
not going to keep 3 point 4 volts going

---------17:49----------
through it let's see it actually is a

---------17:51----------
little bit warm I'm going to lower it to

---------17:53----------
something like no half a volt right

---------17:57----------
someone the lower that's just half of

---------17:58----------
all there's no reason to keep voltage

---------18:02----------
going through now that i believe i found

---------18:03----------
the short and i'm going to look at this

---------18:05----------
thing and once I remove that chip if I

---------18:07----------
see that the short if I see that the

---------18:09----------
power supply is no longer delivering

---------18:10----------
power I know that I caught my short

---------18:20----------
right its way from my hydro station and

---------18:22----------
get hot which I almost forgot I don't

---------18:25----------
have to do any more because this is a

---------18:26----------
JVC JTA and this hot air station gets

---------18:29----------
hot literally instantly I mean this

---------18:31----------
there's no wait time on this I do this

---------18:50----------
I'm trying not to touch the actual metal

---------18:52----------
ends of the chip and now okay I removed

---------18:59----------
it and my shorts gone because it was

---------19:01----------
delivering 0.1 amps at point 5 volts

---------19:03----------
before and now it's delivering zero am

---------19:07----------
0.5 volts I'm going to turn the power

---------19:08----------
supply off i know that i found the cause

---------19:10----------
of my problem and let's just go over

---------19:12----------
this a little bit we're gonna

---------19:29----------
get rid of all that lead free solder and

---------19:32----------
every side so the whole idea here is the

---------19:35----------
lead free solder is going to get sucked

---------19:36----------
up onto that leaded solder ball that I'm

---------19:39----------
running along there suck up all the

---------19:42----------
nasty lead-free solder on every side it

---------19:46----------
may seem like i'm using quote-unquote

---------19:48----------
too much solder the thing is i don't

---------19:51----------
actually keep that on the board that

---------19:53----------
goes away i'm using that so that i can

---------19:56----------
remove the old solder on those pads

---------19:59----------
without having to resort to wick and

---------20:01----------
changing tips in wasting time ok see how

---------20:07----------
much nicer that looks sad thing is

---------20:14----------
you're never going to see how nice this

---------20:15----------
actually looks when I'm looking at it

---------20:16----------
because even though I got this new 422

---------20:19----------
lossless capturing set up before it was

---------20:22----------
it was screwing up when you would try to

---------20:23----------
since screwing up the color space and

---------20:25----------
also was stuck at 420 but even though

---------20:28----------
you see that youtube only allows me to

---------20:30----------
go up to 420 so you'll never see how

---------20:33----------
good it looks what I'm actually looking

---------20:34----------
at it but I think this looks pretty damn

---------20:36----------
good right now pretty nice capture set

---------20:39----------
up now I just got to grab myself a chip

---------20:41----------
I actually forgot the orientation great

---------20:45----------
job dumbass great job and I would

---------20:53----------
actually have to stop the recording so

---------20:54----------
that I can view what the orientation is

---------21:01----------
oh that's just dumb all right so I found

---------21:05----------
the way it's supposed to go great job

---------21:08----------
idiot for not remembering which way it's

---------21:10----------
supposed to go so let's put that chip on

---------21:13----------
there and finish this board ups let me

---------21:16----------
just get the jbc started it's nice and

---------21:18----------
noisy and as always I put too much

---------21:22----------
solder on the center pad that seems to

---------21:24----------
be a cardinal hallmark idiot thing that

---------21:27----------
I'd always do but you'll see that it's

---------21:29----------
not really going to matter much just

---------21:31----------
move this back into proper view now

---------21:40----------
again I don't expect that to sit

---------21:42----------
perfectly when I just put it on there

---------21:43----------
like that and of course it's going to

---------21:44----------
blow away if you try to get it to sit

---------21:47----------
perfectly especially when they're such a

---------21:48----------
mountain on top of it timed is

---------21:52----------
preheating the board at the moment that

---------21:54----------
I

---------22:24----------
so yeah that's once it's aligned like

---------22:27----------
once it's aligned that it really will

---------22:28----------
just pull itself in a place you don't

---------22:30----------
have to align it perfectly just tap it a

---------22:31----------
few times and you'll see you'll see when

---------22:35----------
you're good now of course is all this

---------22:37----------
excess and I think as people try to get

---------22:39----------
it so that that doesn't happen while

---------22:40----------
they're aligning it because i think that

---------22:42----------
people don't understand that you really

---------22:43----------
can adjust it later that really doesn't

---------22:46----------
matter like you put some flux you have a

---------22:48----------
nice blade tip like the t30 dash km

---------22:50----------
that's t30 dash can tip for the hack Oh

---------22:55----------
2032 iron so it's the Hat the t30 dash

---------22:58----------
can set for the hack Oh Jeff mdash 2032

---------23:03----------
iron like what I have over here and you

---------23:05----------
just go around it like that and you're

---------23:08----------
good now what I do after I'm done with

---------23:11----------
all that just to make sure that I've got

---------23:12----------
it nice and flat on the board I'm a

---------23:14----------
heated another time you know and push

---------23:16----------
down so that I added a line in the

---------23:18----------
beginning Bobby since there was too much

---------23:19----------
solder on the center pad it may be

---------23:21----------
sticking up a little so I'll just do

---------23:22----------
this and wait hot air is almost fully

---------23:29----------
heated up just go around it a little bit

---------23:31----------
wait for it to melt

---------23:39----------
push down yeah it's important that this

---------23:43----------
be flat on the board I'm pretty much

---------23:47----------
done yeah I'm not the smartest guy in

---------23:51----------
the world not the best at soldering good

---------23:53----------
you know thank you don't really have to

---------23:56----------
pee she's dumb ass consumer laptop

---------23:59----------
repair any idiot should be able to do

---------24:04----------
this so that bet what was I doing

---------24:09----------
over there why was I cleaning what was

---------24:11----------
already fine that was dumb more dumbness

---------24:20----------
yeah I can live with that all right now

---------24:24----------
we have to put back on the inductor

---------24:30----------
which I haven't knocked off the table

---------24:32----------
that's rising quite surprising

---------24:37----------
this is going to be a pain in the ass

---------24:39----------
this tip is totally not meant for what

---------24:40----------
I'm doing with it come on you can do it

---------24:47----------
you need to use the not micro tip for

---------24:50----------
this this is dumb I should just stop

---------24:52----------
being stubborn and just changed the

---------24:54----------
 tip here we go joy to remove

---------25:01----------
that solder anyway with the larger tip

---------25:03----------
so I don't know why I'm fighting so hard

---------25:06----------
to not use it get that in focus alrighty

---------25:16----------
now let's put the inductor back on that

---------25:19----------
does not have it this this specific

---------25:21----------
component does not have an orientation

---------25:24----------
and dr. is a coil a coil is really a

---------25:28----------
wire that is just who might forget what

---------25:35----------
I was just talking about I'm sure I

---------25:38----------
remember later when i'm done with the

---------25:39----------
video was in the middle of something I

---------25:41----------
just don't remember what it was alright

---------25:43----------
so again bonus points for me if I manage

---------25:45----------
to get that thing on without burning the

---------25:47----------
keyboard backlight connector another

---------25:49----------
thing to understand here is to always

---------25:51----------
put the face I have the board oriented

---------25:54----------
where it's comfortable for you it

---------25:56----------
shouldn't matter to have the board

---------25:57----------
oriented like you know where you think

---------25:59----------
it should be it should be where it's

---------26:02----------
comfortable for you so again if I'm

---------26:03----------
going to be blowing air and I don't want

---------26:05----------
the air to get here I'm not going to

---------26:06----------
blow from here because then I'm going to

---------26:08----------
get it on I'm gonna blow like this can

---------26:10----------
you turn the board around so feel free

---------26:12----------
to turn the board around as much as you

---------26:13----------
need to to make it comfortable for you

---------26:16----------
to make the measurements that you need

---------26:17----------
to measure do the soldering that you

---------26:18----------
need to do and preheat it preheat the

---------26:23----------
whole section so that when I decide to

---------26:27----------
actually go in really close but I'm

---------26:29----------
going to be close to the connector I

---------26:30----------
don't spend as much time there and

---------26:37----------
boom I pushed down the reason I pushed

---------26:42----------
down as good as I said it is important

---------26:44----------
to have all these things flat on the

---------26:45----------
board harder to knock them off part of

---------26:47----------
the damage

---------26:54----------
ok now the million-dollar question is do

---------26:57----------
we get a green light on the charger damn

---------27:03----------
this place is noisy look so much noise

---------27:06----------
everywhere we have a green light on the

---------27:13----------
charger now an orange light in the

---------27:16----------
charger and that's that no really that's

---------27:24----------
that I'm sure that everything on this

---------27:25----------
board works perfectly fine what you want

---------27:28----------
me to test the rest of it what do you

---------27:30----------
want is this a paid youtube channel
