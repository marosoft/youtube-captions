---------00:04----------
all right so today we're working on a 80

---------00:07----------
1707 MacBook that appears to not be

---------00:09----------
turning on we take a look on the desk

---------00:10----------
you'll see that it's taking 100 70

---------00:13----------
milliamps at 5 volts it stuck at 5 volts

---------00:16----------
and the chip that's going to allow the

---------00:19----------
charger to speak to the MacBook and back

---------00:23----------
and forth and turn off the ultrasonic

---------00:40----------
so as can be seen here it's taking 200

---------00:43----------
milliamps and it's at 5 volts this

---------00:46----------
typically means that the chip that's

---------00:47----------
responsible for speaking to the USBC

---------00:50----------
charger and saying hi on 20 volts not 5

---------00:52----------
volts is either dead or not getting

---------00:54----------
power and on this board that is our cd32

---------00:57----------
15 so this over here is our charge port

---------01:00----------
C charge port charge port and this

---------01:06----------
charge port is going to speak to the CD

---------01:11----------
32 15 and you got some stuff going here

---------01:15----------
on pin 6 see that look at that

---------01:16----------
see it talks to the CD 32 15 and this

---------01:20----------
chip over here is called the USBC MUX

---------01:22----------
chip and it's going to be powered on v

---------01:27----------
end voltage in that goes over here at a

---------01:31----------
pp 3 V 3 underscore g3 huh let's see if

---------01:33----------
T P 3 V 3 underscore g3 hunters presence

---------01:38----------
[Music]

---------02:28----------
yeah Kevin

---------02:30----------
[Music]

---------02:40----------
[Music]

---------03:19----------
okay [ __ ] [ __ ] with my head

---------03:24----------
that's your eyes so the first thing

---------03:26----------
we're gonna have to do here is see if PP

---------03:28----------
3v3 underscore g3 Han is present let's

---------03:31----------
see if P P 3 V 3 underscore g3 heart is

---------03:33----------
present and if that's gonna allow this

---------03:35----------
trip to power on so we're gonna turn on

---------03:36----------
Paul Daniels as software we're gonna put

---------03:38----------
it on the screen and we're gonna measure

---------03:42----------
and see if P P 3 V 3 underscore g3 on is

---------03:45----------
present now according to our schematic

---------03:49----------
and board view P P 3 V 3 underscore g3

---------03:51----------
Han can be found on this capacitor right

---------03:54----------
next to the chip so let's see if that's

---------03:57----------
there one point one volts oh one point

---------04:00----------
one volts on PP 3 V 3 g3 hot do you ever

---------04:02----------
seen that one volt and let's see if

---------04:07----------
there's a short 10 kilo ohms no short

---------04:10----------
all right time to go over to the place

---------04:12----------
the pp 3 V 3 under store z3 hot is

---------04:14----------
created and see if there's anything

---------04:15----------
wrong with the creation circuit that's

---------04:16----------
keeping this from working

---------04:25----------
now what reason I'm skipping past here

---------04:28----------
is because all these things I'm looking

---------04:29----------
at is peepee 3v3 underscore g3 hot going

---------04:31----------
into something I need peepee 3v3 g3 hot

---------04:34----------
coming out of something here we have it

---------04:38----------
on you 69 Oh 3 so the enable is gonna be

---------04:43----------
present on pin 10 let's make sure enable

---------04:45----------
is present yeah turn back to voltage

---------04:48----------
mode all right so the enable is 5 volts

---------04:54----------
so it the chip is being told to turn on

---------04:56----------
but it's only putting on 1 volt hmm

---------04:59----------
that's odd now we've got 5 volts coming

---------05:03----------
in the diodes gonna decrease it a little

---------05:06----------
bit which is expected and understandable

---------05:12----------
now in rare cases the diode is actually

---------05:17----------
decreasing currents at the point where

---------05:18----------
this can't work but I'm not sure if

---------05:20----------
that's what's quite happening here so

---------05:21----------
let's say I think that it's only going

---------05:23----------
to give us the full 3.3 or so once it's

---------05:26----------
had a second let's start up and go to 20

---------05:29----------
now here's something interesting so

---------05:30----------
right by one of those CD 32 15s what I

---------05:33----------
see is corrosion nasty filthy awful

---------05:39----------
corrosion so let's see what happens if I

---------05:41----------
use a little bit of flux small amount

---------05:43----------
not too much just a reasonable amount

---------05:46----------
you know same amount that we Paul would

---------05:48----------
suggest that we usually use maniac

---------05:55----------
loded tick Paul that's the amount of

---------05:59----------
flux that you should be using you work

---------06:02----------
for a company that sells flux we have a

---------06:03----------
lot of moving expenses coming up $25,000

---------06:06----------
security deposit probably 30 to 50,000

---------06:09----------
in construction costs moving costs

---------06:12----------
furniture we need to sell a lot of flux

---------06:16----------
Paul do you know many tubes of this we

---------06:22----------
need to sell exactly exactly

---------06:25----------
[ __ ] did I leave the mic on for that you

---------06:29----------
got to show what you got a show to make

---------06:31----------
money am i right Nord VPN folks go to

---------06:36----------
Nord VPN comm slash [ __ ] influencer

---------06:39----------
and enter code [ __ ] influencer

---------06:50----------
the stream was brought to you by

---------06:51----------
authentic Ametek flux

---------06:58----------
genuine Amtech flux Apple Authorized

---------07:03----------
in certified Ametek flux now actually

---------07:05----------
Apple off has a certified

---------07:20----------
all right so we're using 800 milliamps

---------07:22----------
now at five volts which is departure

---------07:24----------
from what we had before

---------07:25----------
now nothing I want to check here is that

---------07:28----------
cap that look nasty was on a different

---------07:31----------
PP 3v3 underscore g3 RL do that seems to

---------07:34----------
come out of the CD 32:15 itself

---------07:39----------
point three

---------07:48----------
hmm

---------07:50----------
when what happens if we change our CD

---------07:52----------
32:15 let's change this chip with

---------07:56----------
another one

---------08:20----------
well then it's a lot of shorts under

---------08:23----------
that [ __ ]

---------10:05----------
what's your Halloween costume I am don't

---------10:08----------
honestly I didn't have time to think

---------10:09----------
about a celebrate Halloween Thank You JP

---------10:11----------
but I have no Halloween costume

---------10:18----------
nobody here did this year actually 2013

---------10:22----------
I remember everybody here dressing up

---------10:23----------
for Halloween

---------10:24----------
posting a picture all right let's get

---------10:29----------
ourselves another CD 3215 from stored on

---------10:33----------
Rosslyn group.com

---------11:30----------
spend it no more running away

---------12:20----------
am i cleaning the peepee says Vermillion

---------12:23----------
perhaps okay we're back to one point

---------12:31----------
four vaults on P P 3 b3 5 volts there is

---------12:35----------
the 5 volts actually coming into the

---------12:37----------
chip 4.7 now sometimes what happens is

---------12:41----------
this diode is actually limiting the

---------12:43----------
current a little too much so it doesn't

---------12:44----------
produce what it's supposed to which

---------12:48----------
could be happening here never know so I

---------12:51----------
am going to replace both we replace that

---------12:54----------
diode right now just in case that's

---------12:56----------
what's going on here committee I got my

---------12:58----------
80 page newly's today and we are gonna

---------13:00----------
go through it at the speed you would

---------13:04----------
imagine for an 80 pages

---------14:12----------
oh look now we get 20 volts check it out

---------14:16----------
see 20 volts so let's go over what was

---------14:19----------
going on here so was that cap that was

---------14:21----------
mildly corroded that I was ignoring

---------14:23----------
because I'm a dumbass second stream in a

---------14:26----------
row last day where I've done something

---------14:28----------
stupid but it might as well show you so

---------14:30----------
that you learn from it it doesn't do you

---------14:31----------
any good if I hide the videos where I'm

---------14:35----------
an idiot so let's go over this now this

---------14:38----------
cap over here was corroded and I

---------14:40----------
stupidly replace this chip which

---------14:42----------
probably did not need to be corroded

---------14:43----------
this camp is for PP 3 V 3 underscore UPC

---------14:46----------
X al do so what's that pp 3 V 3 UPC x al

---------14:50----------
do is a sub R L of pp 3 B 300 square G 3

---------14:54----------
hot most likely now this comes out of

---------14:57----------
the CD 32 15 as you'll see over here see

---------15:00----------
that's our CD 32 15 chip and it comes

---------15:02----------
out of here now when I measured pp 3 B 3

---------15:04----------
underscore G 3 hot to see if there was a

---------15:06----------
short on it when it was only putting out

---------15:08----------
1 point 4 volts rather than 3.3 volts I

---------15:10----------
noticed that there was no short-circuit

---------15:12----------
however when I turned the machine on the

---------15:14----------
rail was being brought down why because

---------15:16----------
the CD 3215 is not going to give people

---------15:18----------
a V 3 underscore G 3 hot a pathway to pp

---------15:22----------
3 V 3 underscore youth DC underscore XA

---------15:25----------
underscore L do until the machine turns

---------15:27----------
on only when the CD 32 15 turns on do

---------15:30----------
you have pp 3 V 3 underscores G 3 hot 2

---------15:33----------
PP 3 V 3 u PCX al do and once that

---------15:35----------
happens then is gonna be a low

---------15:37----------
resistance to ground however I can't

---------15:39----------
measure resistance to ground when the

---------15:41----------
machine and its of itself is off delete

---------15:44----------
that I can't measure resistance to

---------15:46----------
ground when there's power going through

---------15:49----------
so there's no way I would ever be able

---------15:50----------
to find that by measuring I would not be

---------15:52----------
able to see that that short is there on

---------15:53----------
P P 3 V 3 underscore g 3 on until

---------15:55----------
there's power going through it and once

---------15:56----------
this power going through it I'm not

---------15:57----------
going to be able to measure because the

---------15:58----------
CD 3215 needs to be powered on to give a

---------16:00----------
pathway between P P 3 V 3 underscore g 3

---------16:02----------
huh and P P 3 V 3 UPC XA L do

---------16:05----------
so that is why this wasn't working

---------16:07----------
because P P 3 be 300 G 3 husband to 15

---------16:10----------
was giving the Baro a pathway between p

---------16:12----------
b3 b3 underscore g3 hot and it shorted

---------16:14----------
subarray laughs EP 3 b3 UPC XA l do that

---------16:16----------
is only going to be present when there

---------16:17----------
is power going through the machine which

---------16:19----------
is a condition under which I cannot

---------16:20----------
measure resistance to ground on any

---------16:22----------
power line because you cannot measure

---------16:23----------
resistance with a multimeter when this

---------16:24----------
power going to the board

---------16:25----------
hopefully this has taught you something

---------16:27----------
hopefully you've learned from my idiocy

---------16:28----------
and as always I hope you learn something

---------16:30----------
thank you very much and I will see you

---------16:32----------
in the next video see in the next one
