---------00:00----------
hello so today I'm gonna be going over a

---------00:01----------
retina board that has no trackpad so

---------00:09----------
this should be really really really

---------00:13----------
obvious and what makes this particularly

---------00:15----------
funny is this is somebody who came in

---------00:18----------
wanting less I think it was a battery

---------00:19----------
replacement Apple refused to replace

---------00:21----------
their battery without their flat rate

---------00:23----------
fee because the computer had one of the

---------00:25----------
moisture stickers changed in color and

---------00:28----------
as any of you who serviced Apple

---------00:29----------
products know those stickers change from

---------00:31----------
light to red if it rains outside so this

---------00:34----------
was a machine that really honestly

---------00:36----------
legitimately had no liquid damage and

---------00:38----------
they were told [ __ ] you by Apple which

---------00:39----------
is very very common

---------00:40----------
so we quoted a price for it which is

---------00:43----------
what you get when we're buying an

---------00:45----------
original battery and we are slicing the

---------00:47----------
old one out of your machine because

---------00:48----------
again it's not screwed into the computer

---------00:50----------
anymore you have to understand what the

---------00:51----------
retinas they glue that [ __ ] in there and

---------00:53----------
it sucks you know you make one wrong

---------00:55----------
move and you no click click here and

---------00:57----------
you'll see what happens so the whole

---------00:58----------
idea here is we gave a price and he's

---------01:01----------
like that's a ripoff blah blah blah and

---------01:05----------
you know what happens when people say

---------01:07----------
stuff like that what Steve and my

---------01:10----------
receptions - you're like to call instant

---------01:13----------
[ __ ] karma so let's see if any of you

---------01:16----------
can see what the Instant Karma is which

---------01:18----------
is that this has now turned into a $425

---------01:24----------
battery replacement not including the

---------01:26----------
cost of the battery that he has because

---------01:28----------
again as I say I have a solutions based

---------01:31----------
system here where we do not do

---------01:33----------
particular little component replacements

---------01:35----------
and we actually charge for board repair

---------01:39----------
the board repair rate and this would

---------01:43----------
have been so much cheaper if he just

---------01:46----------
wasn't an [ __ ] because again even

---------01:49----------
though I do have that solutions base

---------01:50----------
rate sometimes sometimes my little

---------01:52----------
Scrooge's heart warms up a little bit

---------01:54----------
and I'm nice about these things and I

---------01:57----------
and here's the thing here's the most

---------01:59----------
important thing with this business a lot

---------02:01----------
of the times whether or not we do stuff

---------02:04----------
at retail discounted or free really

---------02:08----------
comes down to whether or not your mother

---------02:09----------
succeeded in teaching you how to not be

---------02:11----------
an [ __ ] but it

---------02:13----------
your mother failed and teaching you how

---------02:14----------
to not be an [ __ ] paying $425 for an

---------02:19----------
induct and and that's really the point

---------02:24----------
that I wanted to get across with this

---------02:25----------
video because for those of you who don't

---------02:29----------
regularly watch the channel the reason

---------02:31----------
that I do solutions based billing is

---------02:33----------
let's say like they say the only problem

---------02:36----------
I had is the trackpad right so let's say

---------02:38----------
that as you could see here I'm not doing

---------02:40----------
anything to any other portion of the

---------02:41----------
board I am not touching other portions

---------02:43----------
of this motherboard

---------02:44----------
I am only working on this little section

---------02:47----------
so let's say he says well every now and

---------02:51----------
then this freezes well like six months

---------02:53----------
down the line my backlight brightness

---------02:55----------
control isn't working the way it did now

---------02:58----------
but your inclination is going to be your

---------03:01----------
natural inclination is going to be is to

---------03:02----------
say well we didn't work on that and

---------03:04----------
you're gonna politely tell them to go

---------03:06----------
away but the thing is they're not and

---------03:08----------
then then they're going to expect

---------03:10----------
service because they paid you even if it

---------03:11----------
was only for that little component

---------03:13----------
replacement because people don't really

---------03:15----------
want to think that it's something that

---------03:17----------
they did or just something something

---------03:18----------
that's their bad luck it's gotta be you

---------03:19----------
it's got to be the last guy who touched

---------03:21----------
and you know there there are some really

---------03:24----------
really smart people who have talked on

---------03:26----------
this romo I remember Allen Glasser who

---------03:28----------
teaches this class and he said you know

---------03:32----------
when you touch it you own it so your

---------03:34----------
price has to kind of cover owning that

---------03:36----------
system so if you come back a month later

---------03:39----------
and your issue is PCH related and I have

---------03:42----------
to replace a chip with nine hundred

---------03:43----------
balls on that man how do I gonna feel if

---------03:46----------
I charge you 20 bucks for an inductor

---------03:48----------
and it kind of removes that argument

---------03:51----------
again I don't have to argue about all

---------03:53----------
that stuff back and forth there's no

---------03:54----------
arguing back and forth to be had because

---------03:56----------
you paid for a an overall service not

---------04:00----------
for like a single inductor but in this

---------04:03----------
case there's a very good chance that it

---------04:05----------
really honest-to-god only is the single

---------04:08----------
inductor and this is not the [ __ ]

---------04:10----------
soldering iron tip I should be using for

---------04:11----------
this item

---------04:12----------
I dare not use hot air when I'm that

---------04:16----------
close to a plastic connector

---------04:19----------
okay let's cider you down on the other

---------04:21----------
end

---------04:28----------
okay

---------04:37----------
and because you're an [ __ ]

---------04:40----------
because you went out of your way to be

---------04:42----------
an [ __ ] to huff and puff to leave the

---------04:45----------
door open to look at us funny when we

---------04:47----------
said excuse me sir do you mind closing

---------04:49----------
the door and that is $425 like really I

---------04:54----------
mean that that is what it comes down to

---------04:57----------
in the tech business and it's just

---------04:58----------
something that I really want to get

---------05:00----------
across to you because it's gonna happen

---------05:01----------
in other sections of your life and I

---------05:03----------
know it's something that happens to me

---------05:04----------
on a regular basis where I know that

---------05:06----------
whether or not somebody is going to

---------05:08----------
choose to go above and beyond to help me

---------05:10----------
out or whether they are just going to

---------05:12----------
stick within their standard rigid

---------05:14----------
policies it's really gonna be based on

---------05:16----------
again did my parents succeed in teaching

---------05:19----------
me how to not be an [ __ ] because very

---------05:21----------
often I am an [ __ ] but often I am an

---------05:24----------
[ __ ] to people who have been an

---------05:25----------
[ __ ] to me I'm usually not an [ __ ]

---------05:27----------
to people if they have not given me a

---------05:29----------
reason to and you know technically I'm

---------05:33----------
not being mean I'm not overcharging this

---------05:36----------
this is motherboard repair and I am

---------05:40----------
charging you for motherboard repair it

---------05:42----------
is my retail rate for motherboard repair

---------05:45----------
and I fixed it but again you know do I

---------05:51----------
want to give you a break like I would

---------05:54----------
say fifty seventy-five percent of the

---------05:56----------
time I will give you a break if you were

---------05:59----------
nice humble honest and you just [ __ ]

---------06:01----------
something up but again you curse huff

---------06:06----------
and puff under your breath you leave the

---------06:08----------
door open use nasty derogatory names

---------06:12----------
$425 you got to think about this kind of

---------06:16----------
stuff it's important you know if you

---------06:18----------
have an appointment be nice to the

---------06:19----------
receptionist you have a job interview be

---------06:21----------
nice to the receptionist be nice to the

---------06:23----------
janitor be nice to the people who work

---------06:24----------
for the people work for the people who

---------06:26----------
are choosing whether or not to hire you

---------06:28----------
and ever you walk into any type of

---------06:30----------
business try to put again don't go above

---------06:33----------
and beyond to you know to just suck up

---------06:36----------
to everybody but just just try to be

---------06:38----------
nice try to be personable try to be

---------06:40----------
somebody that other people would like to

---------06:42----------
help if that's who you are you're gonna

---------06:44----------
find that a lot of people in the world

---------06:45----------
are gonna be very very happy to help you

---------06:47----------
out and lift you up during your bad

---------06:49----------
times but if you're just

---------06:50----------
dick for no [ __ ] reason you are gonna

---------06:53----------
meet resistance every single point in

---------06:56----------
your life and your life is going to be

---------06:58----------
harder and you will be less successful

---------06:59----------
even if you are a qualified person even

---------07:02----------
if you do disease for some reason and

---------07:04----------
feel that you've deserved your earned

---------07:06----------
the success that you feel you don't have

---------07:08----------
justice how do you treat the world how

---------07:11----------
do you interact with the world how do

---------07:13----------
you treat people when that person is not

---------07:15----------
somebody who's really important to you

---------07:17----------
because you're gonna find that again

---------07:19----------
someday somehow you're gonna need that

---------07:22----------
person's help or you're gonna need that

---------07:24----------
person's friends help or that person's

---------07:25----------
co-workers sisters mother-in-law's help

---------07:28----------
and it really is gonna come down to

---------07:31----------
whether or not you are an [ __ ] you

---------07:33----------
see one thing to realize when it comes

---------07:34----------
to giving a discount or when it comes to

---------07:36----------
going above and beyond produce things

---------07:38----------
that are outside of your the way your

---------07:40----------
business practices or outside of the

---------07:43----------
scope of what it is your services it's

---------07:45----------
really gonna be based on a how nice they

---------07:48----------
were to you and be who was wrong

---------07:50----------
so yeah you do have a crappy situation

---------07:53----------
yeah it is just one component knocked

---------07:55----------
off of your board but why is it that you

---------07:57----------
have one component knocked off of your

---------07:58----------
board well it's because you decided to

---------08:01----------
purchase a battery you decided to take

---------08:03----------
apart a computer that you're not

---------08:04----------
qualified to take apart you decided that

---------08:07----------
you were gonna try to save twenty bucks

---------08:09----------
because the difference in price between

---------08:10----------
the retail battery he bought and my

---------08:12----------
wholesale battery plus my labor to

---------08:14----------
replace it wound up being literally $20

---------08:16----------
difference so the thing is you decided

---------08:19----------
to screw yourself and for some reason

---------08:21----------
since you decided to screw yourself you

---------08:23----------
want me to do something outside of what

---------08:25----------
I usually do to help you know again if

---------08:30----------
if I knocked that thing off for the

---------08:32----------
board while I was working on your stuff

---------08:33----------
then we'll talk and yeah I I gotta help

---------08:36----------
you for free but you broke it and let's

---------08:41----------
just focus on the reason you broke it

---------08:42----------
you broke it specifically because you

---------08:45----------
did not want to come here so again like

---------08:51----------
where is the sympathy again even I

---------08:53----------
understand if you want to save money and

---------08:54----------
do [ __ ] yourself by all means go ahead

---------08:56----------
and do that

---------08:57----------
I even understand if you break that [ __ ]

---------08:59----------
and you come here and you're like please

---------09:01----------
help I'll help you but

---------09:04----------
just don't be an [ __ ] for no reason
