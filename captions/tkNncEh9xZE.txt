---------00:00----------
well it's kind of working already him so

---------00:02----------
he fixed it by staring at it that's the

---------00:05----------
power of having a million subscribers in

---------00:06----------
a social media platform once you have a

---------00:08----------
million subscribers you're what's

---------00:10----------
considered an influencer and once you're

---------00:12----------
an influencer you can do things like

---------00:14----------
just influence the board to work again

---------00:15----------
simply by sitting in front of it and

---------00:17----------
talking in this voice that's right folks

---------00:22----------
attack me and get burned hey everybody

---------00:34----------
how's it going so today we're gonna be

---------00:36----------
fixing a MacBook this is an a 1466

---------00:39----------
MacBook Air that has liquid damage

---------00:41----------
before we get started I just like to

---------00:42----------
give a big shout out and thank you to

---------00:44----------
Paul Daniels Paul Daniels is responsible

---------00:46----------
for the multimeter software that you see

---------00:47----------
me using on the screen that shows up

---------00:49----------
above my head as well as the board view

---------00:50----------
software that I use for figuring out

---------00:53----------
where things are on the boards before

---------00:54----------
Paul Daniels I used to use software that

---------00:56----------
was absolutely awful that I believe

---------00:58----------
stopped production in around 1995 or

---------01:00----------
1996 called Lander X test link but

---------01:03----------
thanks to Paul Daniels open more view

---------01:05----------
and flex board view my life has been

---------01:07----------
made easier that's all the lives of my

---------01:08----------
employees I highly suggest that you

---------01:10----------
check out a software on PL Daniel's

---------01:11----------
dot-com that's PL Daniel's com that

---------01:15----------
being said we're going to get to this

---------01:17----------
machine and try and figure out what is

---------01:20----------
wrong with it let's open it up and see

---------01:22----------
what's going on with this MacBook and

---------01:23----------
see if we could make it work again David

---------01:26----------
Boyd says eli has 970 K subscribers Eli

---------01:30----------
who Eli what explain like I'm five Eli

---------01:36----------
Congrats on the 1 million just watch the

---------01:38----------
video why thank you it's very kind of

---------01:41----------
you

---------01:50----------
all right what do we have here on this

---------01:58----------
MacBook okay we're gonna turn on our

---------02:01----------
power supply have the power supply as

---------02:05----------
well as the multimeter software show up

---------02:07----------
on the screen thank you to circuit

---------02:11----------
specialists for the power supply and the

---------02:14----------
power supply software and thank you to

---------02:16----------
Paul Daniels for his multimeter software

---------02:19----------
let's just turn on the multimeter

---------02:21----------
software turn on serial mode on the

---------02:24----------
multimeter and get that stuff showing up

---------02:26----------
in the screen the big thank you to Paul

---------02:29----------
Daniels for creating some of the best

---------02:31----------
software that I've ever had the

---------02:32----------
privilege of using and my thirty years

---------02:35----------
on earth

---------02:36----------
thank you Paul Daniels okay as you can

---------02:39----------
see there's no green light on the

---------02:41----------
charger that means that the first thing

---------02:43----------
we need to do is check pp3 before to

---------02:45----------
underscore g3 hot pp3 for two is the

---------02:48----------
power rail it's going to power the

---------02:49----------
circuit that allows the computer to

---------02:51----------
speak to the charger the computer needs

---------02:53----------
to speak to the charger before the

---------02:55----------
charger light will turn green if the

---------02:57----------
charger light doesn't turn green the

---------02:58----------
chart is like machines are not gonna act

---------03:00----------
as if we plug the charger in and

---------03:01----------
nothing's going to work let's open up a

---------03:03----------
schematic for this machine and go

---------03:05----------
through it now you may wonder how do I

---------03:07----------
know that I need PP 3 before 2 in order

---------03:09----------
for the charging circuitry to work and

---------03:10----------
that's an excellent question let's look

---------03:12----------
it up on a similar machine that I have a

---------03:15----------
full schematic available for so that you

---------03:17----------
can understand why it is that I want

---------03:19----------
people read 40 to be present before I

---------03:21----------
can do any real work on the machine so

---------03:24----------
here we have our charger this is gonna

---------03:27----------
be a charge port on the board of a

---------03:29----------
different machine and we could take a

---------03:31----------
look at that in the schematic if you

---------03:32----------
take a look here you'll see that there's

---------03:34----------
three things we've got 18 volts we have

---------03:36----------
ground and we have a damper sense

---------03:39----------
adapter sense is gonna be responsible

---------03:40----------
for sense in the adapter it goes to this

---------03:42----------
chip which has several pins it has round

---------03:45----------
boring xed external like the charger is

---------03:48----------
outside the machine external from the

---------03:50----------
machine and internal like it's speaking

---------03:52----------
to something inside the machine like an

---------03:53----------
SMC chip and here it gets the power it

---------03:55----------
needs to turn on the power it needs to

---------03:57----------
turn on comes from this chip

---------03:58----------
this chip is gonna allow people for 200

---------04:00----------
Scourge III hunt pass through if smc bc

---------04:02----------
AC okay is present if you don't have to

---------04:04----------
be through before to underscore g3 hunt

---------04:05----------
this chip can't do its job now what does

---------04:07----------
assist one wire thing what it speaks to

---------04:09----------
that is a line a data line

---------04:12----------
bi-directional data line that's gonna go

---------04:14----------
to the SMC and the SMC over here is

---------04:17----------
another chip that's gonna be powered by

---------04:19----------
a happy friendly neighborhood power or

---------04:21----------
health PP through to for to underscore

---------04:24----------
g3 hot so if you take a look over here

---------04:26----------
when I click you'll find the SMC chip

---------04:31----------
over here and the SMC chip is a chip

---------04:33----------
that's powered by Pippi 304 to

---------04:36----------
underscore and g3 hot which is a power

---------04:39----------
rail that we need now the reason I

---------04:41----------
showed you this on an older board is

---------04:43----------
because in the MacBook Air that one wire

---------04:45----------
circuit is not on the motherboard it's

---------04:47----------
on the separate dcn board for which I do

---------04:49----------
not have a schematic however I'm able to

---------04:52----------
ascertain that it's the same design

---------04:53----------
because it uses chips that look

---------04:55----------
identical and it still uses a MagSafe so

---------04:58----------
let's just take a look on the schematic

---------05:00----------
and see if we can find where people

---------05:02----------
through before to underscore g3 home be

---------05:04----------
present using paul daniels is lovely

---------05:06----------
software now we're just gonna go to the

---------05:08----------
power rails page on the schematic it's

---------05:12----------
got my list of rails right over here

---------05:19----------
look at that look at that happy Lister

---------05:21----------
rails

---------05:21----------
and Wow the machine just turned on in

---------05:23----------
front of me and just chimed isn't that

---------05:25----------
lovely

---------05:26----------
let's see that again

---------05:33----------
okay that's interesting well it's kind

---------05:36----------
of working already

---------05:37----------
so we fixed it by staring at it that's

---------05:40----------
the power of having a million

---------05:41----------
subscribers in a social media platform

---------05:43----------
once you have some million subscribers

---------05:45----------
you're what's considered an influencer

---------05:47----------
and once you're an influencer you can do

---------05:49----------
things like just influence the board to

---------05:50----------
work again simply by sitting in front of

---------05:52----------
it and talking in this voice that's

---------05:54----------
right folks don't delay

---------05:56----------
become a YouTube influence or today on

---------05:58----------
social media platforms and then you can

---------06:00----------
have MacBooks that sit in front of you

---------06:01----------
just like this one that didn't work that

---------06:03----------
took 20 mili-amps that take 500

---------06:06----------
milliamps for no good reason

---------06:07----------
influencer no serious we have to figure

---------06:10----------
out what's going on with this because

---------06:11----------
that's kind of [ __ ] I could give

---------06:12----------
this back to the customer like that so

---------06:15----------
people 0 for 2 is gonna come out of this

---------06:17----------
power rail over here l 7095 so let's see

---------06:25----------
what this section of the board looks

---------06:27----------
like use PP 0 for 2 is gonna come out of

---------06:30----------
here so we got the charger power coming

---------06:31----------
in through here charger 18 volts 18

---------06:35----------
volts 18 volts goes in it goes to chip

---------06:42----------
chip makes it 3.42 and let's see if the

---------06:46----------
chip is a happy chip or sad chip oh my

---------06:57----------
well that's a little bit sad looking

---------06:59----------
let's take a look at the rest of the

---------07:00----------
machine and see what's going on with it

---------07:01----------
see if it looks sad or not my kids get

---------07:12----------
used to being an influencer I'm gonna

---------07:15----------
influence the corrosion right off this

---------07:16----------
board I'm gonna influence these

---------07:19----------
allergies right out of my sinus

---------07:22----------
you know be really cool as an influencer

---------07:24----------
I liked it I should go up to that

---------07:29----------
landlord at 124 West 30th Street and say

---------07:31----------
you know what you want me to influence

---------07:33----------
the people to want to invest in your

---------07:34----------
building hate contractor I'm gonna

---------07:39----------
influence some people to use your

---------07:40----------
company can you trade in this whole

---------07:44----------
influencer thing for anything that's

---------07:45----------
actually worthwhile yeah I don't want to

---------07:50----------
free stay at some [ __ ] three-star Hotel

---------07:52----------
or what I would really like I like free

---------08:01----------
rent for the next 10 years could I

---------08:03----------
influence that can I go to the

---------08:09----------
Department of Buildings and say hey I

---------08:10----------
like my permit expedited for the

---------08:12----------
storefront reconstruction I'm an

---------08:14----------
influencer I'll get a lot of exposure

---------08:20----------
for your Bureau and bureaucracy for

---------08:22----------
construction so that people will stop

---------08:24----------
putting paper in front of their windows

---------08:26----------
and doing all the construction illegally

---------08:27----------
without permits and flew in sir the

---------08:31----------
influencer think about it think about it

---------08:42----------
do you think I could go to the

---------08:43----------
Department of Buildings and say I'm an

---------08:45----------
influencer you should expedite my

---------08:47----------
permits so I influence people to stop

---------08:48----------
putting brown paper on the front of

---------08:49----------
their storefronts when they do

---------08:50----------
construction illegally because you take

---------08:52----------
so long it's actually worth a try

---------08:57----------
yeah let's convince people that you

---------09:02----------
don't have to break the law in order to

---------09:04----------
do basic construction in New York City

---------09:07----------
which is what everybody does every time

---------09:11----------
I see some new deli or bodega or some

---------09:13----------
[ __ ] like I always see the brown paper

---------09:15----------
up some music blaring inside so you

---------09:18----------
can't hear the construction going on

---------09:20----------
just the sound of New York

---------09:23----------
that's the sound of New York all right

---------09:28----------
so we're gonna take a look over this

---------09:29----------
entire board see what's going on here

---------09:44----------
dcn board one wire circuit chips that's

---------09:47----------
the chip that powers the chip that

---------09:48----------
allows the charge to speak to the SMC

---------09:50----------
this is the trip that actually allows

---------09:51----------
the charger to speak to the SMC

---------10:02----------
[Music]

---------10:22----------
[Music]

---------10:32----------
what the [ __ ]

---------10:35----------
[Music]

---------10:48----------
thank you how is this so stable this fan

---------10:56----------
sucks

---------10:58----------
[Music]

---------11:13----------
[Music]

---------11:32----------
come at me bro

---------11:45----------
[Music]

---------11:51----------
oh did I actually get it

---------12:03----------
right

---------12:08----------
attack me and get burned congratulations

---------12:21----------
losing me is the most non-threatening

---------12:22----------
way possible may you get everything you

---------12:24----------
deserve thank you

---------12:35----------
it's not it

---------12:50----------
very mild stuff by bios that's not gonna

---------12:52----------
affect green light mild stuff by I

---------12:54----------
believe is P P 1 vo v of RAM power by

---------12:57----------
Ram so most likely are not working was

---------13:00----------
due to nasty [ __ ] in this area so if we

---------13:03----------
clean this area the pp 3 or 2 area it's

---------13:06----------
likely gonna work just fine yeah see

---------13:09----------
this all this thing needed was a q-tip

---------13:11----------
and it's a little bit of influence from

---------13:14----------
a professional influencer

---------13:48----------
no soldering next two data for the day

---------13:50----------
for today

---------14:04----------
influence

---------15:08----------
wait for this thing to rap it cool

---------16:23----------
being an influencer was harder than I

---------16:25----------
thought

---------16:30----------
it still does the same thing it only

---------16:32----------
turns on after I influence it see I had

---------16:35----------
to reminded that I was at influencer it

---------16:36----------
wasn't use drawing any power until just

---------16:38----------
then something strange going on here

---------16:49----------
WTF WTF WTF WTF

---------17:01----------
yeah this is not how this is supposed to

---------17:03----------
work see good to do with the special

---------17:04----------
MacBook responded to your random repair

---------17:06----------
cleaning offer nope

---------17:07----------
as somebody posted the original poster

---------17:10----------
on reddit will always disappoint

---------17:11----------
guaranteed so this doesn't make watch I

---------17:15----------
tap it 0.1 volts nothing pp 3 before 2

---------17:20----------
is not being created do we have 18 volts

---------17:22----------
coming in we have 18 volts coming in so

---------17:26----------
our pp 3 before to regulator is delaying

---------17:28----------
somehow so it's taking a few seconds

---------17:30----------
before it turns on after you plug it in

---------17:32----------
so I'm going to repeal and then replace

---------17:36----------
the pp 3 before to regulator with a

---------17:39----------
better one

---------17:55----------
and influencing

---------18:14----------
yeah I really thought that I was an

---------18:16----------
influence in there for a second but that

---------18:17----------
that was a bunch of horseshit now the

---------18:19----------
board still didn't work it was just

---------18:21----------
[ __ ] with me is off his board was

---------18:26----------
[ __ ] with me

---------18:40----------
Congrats for the million thanks for

---------18:41----------
being genuine seems like a rarity I

---------18:43----------
thank you

---------19:33----------
[Music]

---------20:07----------
a greenie

---------20:18----------
I thank you Panem for that kind coming

---------20:27----------
I'm gonna influence this chip to work

---------20:29----------
even though it's chipped would not be

---------20:32----------
called a chip what did not have a chip

---------20:34----------
though this chip is gonna work

---------20:45----------
going to engage it look at that

---------20:57----------
all right now we're gonna see if this

---------20:58----------
thing turns on quicker than before don't

---------21:02----------
give me some stupid delay one two I

---------21:07----------
attach you okay that's a little better

---------21:14----------
still on the slow side okay turn off

---------21:18----------
okay one two three turn on is PP through

---------21:26----------
before to present yeah and that's just

---------21:30----------
the multimeter being slow all right

---------21:32----------
that's good so as you can see we managed

---------21:35----------
to influence this board to work again by

---------21:36----------
staring at it I'm gonna ultrasonic that

---------21:39----------
corrosion off because it could be

---------21:40----------
causing some of the funkiness and some

---------21:42----------
strange symptoms down the line but

---------21:44----------
that's it for today we we fixed the

---------21:46----------
board through the magic of having a

---------21:47----------
million subscribers on the internet as

---------21:50----------
always I hope you learned something
