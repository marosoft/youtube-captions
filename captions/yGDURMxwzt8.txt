---------00:00----------
we'll get free guidance on how to fix

---------00:02----------
any MacBook Board problem from Paul any

---------00:04----------
time of the day hey everybody how's it

---------00:16----------
going so today we're gonna get to work

---------00:17----------
on a Macbook board repair this setup is

---------00:19----------
not perfect yet but we are making some

---------00:21----------
progress we got some acoustic panels

---------00:23----------
over here we're gonna be getting more in

---------00:25----------
soon and today we're gonna get started

---------00:27----------
with a MacBook that's not turning on

---------00:29----------
here for Robert let's open this thing up

---------00:32----------
and see what's going on with it so I'm

---------00:34----------
gonna open up the bottom of the machine

---------00:36----------
and I'll be able to show you what's

---------00:37----------
going on in my overhead camera alright

---------00:41----------
let's see what's going on here you know

---------00:49----------
they said this is not turning on so I'm

---------00:53----------
kind of curious to see what's going on

---------00:54----------
there I'm gonna turn on my power supply

---------00:56----------
so that you can see how much power it's

---------01:00----------
taking hmm

---------01:03----------
my power supply to software just froze

---------01:05----------
it just straight up Paul Daniels with me

---------01:08----------
there we go so let's see how much this

---------01:12----------
is taken so we are grabbing 500

---------01:17----------
milliamps which is actually exactly what

---------01:19----------
I would expect for this to turn on so

---------01:21----------
this is probably is turning on I'm

---------01:23----------
working right now alright I think this

---------01:28----------
is turning on we're just not getting a

---------01:29----------
screen let's see if this just double

---------01:30----------
check and see if that's the case all

---------01:33----------
right so I'm getting 0 volts on screen

---------01:35----------
but it's also taking a hundred milliamps

---------01:37----------
which tends to mean that it doesn't have

---------01:39----------
a brain that's no good I hit the power

---------01:44----------
button again and I'm getting I'm still

---------01:46----------
stuck on 100 milliamps let's try that

---------01:47----------
one more time 24 millimeters 4 L missing

---------01:52----------
500 milliamps turning on properly 300

---------01:54----------
milliamps that's the number I've never

---------01:55----------
seen before and throughout the process

---------01:59----------
nothing on the screen even though the

---------02:01----------
fan is spinning so we got fan spinning

---------02:02----------
not activating the screen but the fan

---------02:05----------
stops spinning soon after it starts

---------02:07----------
spinning so there's a brain-dead problem

---------02:09----------
going on here cuz 340 ml amps and fan

---------02:11----------
spinning on and off like that there's a

---------02:12----------
brain-dead issue

---------02:13----------
here and kind of wondering if you can

---------02:16----------
see why I'm losing interest in working

---------02:19----------
on it right now

---------02:21----------
actually it's happening very quickly in

---------02:22----------
real time I'm losing all interest in

---------02:24----------
working on this particular machine so if

---------02:26----------
you take a look before I even get the

---------02:28----------
microscope going do you see anything

---------02:32----------
funky over there this over here so

---------02:35----------
someone ripped stuff off the top of this

---------02:37----------
board that's a layer that's just ripped

---------02:39----------
off the top of the board and that's not

---------02:40----------
good because that means is that sorry

---------02:43----------
everybody gonna need some Dramamine for

---------02:45----------
the stream until I get this whole thing

---------02:46----------
situated I don't really know what I'm

---------02:48----------
gonna do about this top mount this is

---------02:50----------
way too shaky like do I just hang it

---------02:52----------
from the ceiling or something and if I

---------02:53----------
do it's got to find a mount that

---------02:55----------
actually is long enough so that if I

---------02:56----------
hang it from the ceiling it'll make its

---------02:58----------
way to the desk okay so the first thing

---------02:59----------
is first here let's take the board out

---------03:01----------
and see what it looks like on the other

---------03:02----------
side I think that this is gonna be brain

---------03:04----------
dead because this CPU missed some traces

---------03:07----------
to the CPU may have gotten shredded

---------03:10----------
something may be going through that fan

---------03:12----------
grommet over there you don't have to

---------03:17----------
take the SSD out however corrosion could

---------03:19----------
get in those probe points under the SSD

---------03:21----------
which is why I take interest in taking a

---------03:23----------
look at it

---------04:00----------
we're going to take a look under this

---------04:02----------
board in the microscope and see if we

---------04:03----------
see anything that's strange

---------04:43----------
Thank You JP thank you very much

---------04:46----------
French macaroons anybody want a French

---------04:48----------
macaroon hmm all right border pears done

---------04:51----------
for the day you guys can all leave now

---------04:53----------
Thank You JP thank you that's the idea

---------04:57----------
Katherine we're here to ruin your diet

---------05:01----------
on this channel all right don't see

---------05:11----------
anything funky just yet

---------05:16----------
uh-huh okay that's a standard you 1950

---------05:20----------
area but this typically keeps you from

---------05:22----------
turning on we got it hmm maybe this

---------05:24----------
could have it turning on and then

---------05:25----------
turning itself off afterwards

---------05:51----------
whoo

---------05:57----------
do you see what I see and I don't turn

---------06:02----------
ten tenten tenten tenten tenten Ted

---------06:09----------
Turner to to to to to to to to

---------06:14----------
and yes folks every time you have a jtag

---------06:17----------
connector problem on a macbook it is

---------06:19----------
christmas this is a macbook repair

---------06:24----------
technicians definition of Christmastime

---------06:28----------
tan-tan tan tan-tan tan tan-tan tan

---------06:33----------
tan-tan dad ad I had an attitude to

---------06:38----------
beauty to if you hang Christmas trees in

---------06:41----------
the front of your store every repair

---------06:43----------
will be Christmas just like this one

---------07:04----------
and at the tan-tan tan tan-tan turn that

---------07:10----------
that terror error

---------07:23----------
dunt dunt down't down't down't down't

---------07:27----------
down't down't and and and and and in

---------07:30----------
turn at that time their dad a dating

---------07:36----------
McCarroll I haven't I've gotten that

---------07:39----------
suggestion from a lot of people that

---------07:40----------
HDMI to Ethernet thing

---------07:51----------
problem is I'd have to have kept cat six

---------07:54----------
jacks every swear every we're going ever

---------07:56----------
to everything which I don't really have

---------07:59----------
yet we're not really into that stage of

---------08:02----------
the project

---------08:13----------
we could've it's just it would have been

---------08:15----------
at the expense of everything else

---------08:26----------
okay next up

---------08:57----------
yeah the thing is I don't I don't have

---------09:00----------
cat six jacks or even an rj45 Jack's on

---------09:02----------
the wall for everybody to just plug

---------09:05----------
their stuff into like that would have

---------09:07----------
required putting what running wire all

---------09:08----------
through the wall and everything and we

---------09:10----------
never really got to that

---------09:18----------
half of the people here is still on

---------09:20----------
Wi-Fi which sucks it's just you know

---------09:22----------
have at the moment stops available I can

---------09:25----------
either have a text on fixing stuff or

---------09:27----------
run rj45 in the wall and I haven't

---------09:32----------
gotten around to that there's literally

---------09:35----------
a cat6 cable that it's the same cat6

---------09:37----------
cable from two and a half weeks ago when

---------09:39----------
I first moved in here that was running

---------09:40----------
from the router to the front it was

---------09:43----------
running from the router to my room so I

---------09:45----------
could start streaming that one night

---------09:47----------
like that cable stole in the floor

---------09:48----------
obviously I got to fix that that can't

---------09:50----------
stay like that but Paul's heading on a

---------09:53----------
very well needed vacation after a

---------09:55----------
ridiculous amount of overtime next week

---------09:57----------
we have weeks and weeks of [ __ ] to catch

---------10:00----------
up on so like there are some tickets

---------10:02----------
were behind by over 10 days which is

---------10:03----------
just disgusting so yeah like stuff like

---------10:08----------
cat5 and cat6 I mean rj45 connectors

---------10:11----------
everywhere that's just not yeah like

---------10:14----------
that thing where you don't need cat 6

---------10:15----------
you can use cat 5 like those arguments

---------10:17----------
are so irrelevant to me right now

---------10:18----------
I I don't care about debating the two

---------10:22----------
the cost is almost the same they just

---------10:27----------
gotta fix stuff at this point I got

---------10:32----------
through the eugenie but what I did what

---------10:35----------
I did get is I actually got these things

---------10:36----------
I got these I got these plates that have

---------10:39----------
a cat 6 and an HDMI port on it and it

---------10:41----------
would be really nice when we have time

---------10:42----------
to actually run them to a lot of the

---------10:43----------
desks so you haven't a cat 6 thingy I

---------10:46----------
mean an rj45 thingy and then an HDMI

---------10:49----------
thingy a female port by each desk that's

---------10:54----------
something I'd like to do but it's just

---------10:55----------
again it's like when is it who is gonna

---------10:57----------
do it

---------10:57----------
when's he gonna happen and is that the

---------11:02----------
most important question is that more

---------11:04----------
important than getting people their

---------11:04----------
stuff back like

---------11:14----------
so all the stuff that I've been doing

---------11:16----------
here I've been doing in phases you know

---------11:18----------
I do a little bit of work a little bit

---------11:20----------
of moving then people call start you

---------11:22----------
know I'm gonna kill you if you don't get

---------11:24----------
me my computer back then we go back to

---------11:27----------
fixing then we fix stuff get caught up

---------11:29----------
do a little bit more moving people start

---------11:31----------
calling we're gonna kill you if you

---------11:32----------
don't get our stuff back and that and

---------11:34----------
then like it's kind of like a seesaw

---------11:35----------
like that because the people who are

---------11:38----------
doing all the setup and the hanging the

---------11:40----------
cameras and you know configuring the

---------11:42----------
security system and all that and are the

---------11:44----------
people who were actually the text that

---------11:46----------
fixed stuff indeed

---------11:52----------
what do you think of an idea walsim is

---------11:54----------
that people should have ideas idea

---------11:55----------
shouldn't have people I'd enjoy it I've

---------11:58----------
been doing my best over the past like I

---------11:59----------
think that was actually one of my new

---------12:00----------
year's resolutions check myself and

---------12:04----------
become less ideologically possessed like

---------12:08----------
have my opinions but just make sure that

---------12:10----------
my opinions don't have me I've been I've

---------12:14----------
been checking myself really hard on that

---------12:16----------
lately I probably should have done it a

---------12:19----------
long time ago but

---------12:25----------
we like to try to not be what's wrong

---------12:27----------
with the world there's a lot wrong with

---------12:30----------
the world but I don't want to contribute

---------12:31----------
to it it's easy enough to contribute to

---------12:34----------
it without even noticing you're doing it

---------13:15----------
and you see what we're gonna do here

---------13:16----------
right so that's gonna get run right over

---------13:20----------
here I wouldn't mix power and Ethernet

---------13:25----------
someone said

---------13:30----------
yeah it's definitely probably something

---------13:32----------
we shouldn't do I hear power and

---------13:34----------
Ethernet don't mix well

---------14:23----------
okay that's a bit of a flux II mess

---------14:29----------
Luke I've been doing it for over 10

---------14:32----------
years and I don't even know what I'm

---------14:33----------
doing it right so don't feel bad I was

---------14:38----------
that also power canary even working I

---------14:39----------
don't know man

---------14:44----------
runnin on fumes see I made a little hook

---------14:47----------
there all right let's get a donor board

---------14:53----------
ourselves a donor a 1502 grab that chip

---------14:58----------
off of robust robust robust well the

---------15:04----------
next right repair hearing B I believe

---------15:06----------
it's in Colorado in on the fifth this is

---------15:10----------
gonna be that's not the best timing

---------15:11----------
because I'm barely recovered from like

---------15:14----------
just did this I was hoping the stored

---------15:17----------
the 100 the new place would be a hundred

---------15:18----------
percent like not 80 or 70 or 90 percent

---------15:21----------
before I left but such is life I'll be

---------15:24----------
there I really got to fix the HDMI port

---------15:28----------
my damn Sony before then actually it

---------15:32----------
kind of works but kinda is not really

---------15:34----------
what I'm looking for when trying to

---------15:36----------
broadcast something

---------15:48----------
all right I didn't get any notification

---------15:52----------
either he have any plans to run repair

---------15:54----------
class I'm gonna get settled yep I do but

---------15:57----------
I gotta find some more people first

---------16:04----------
[Music]

---------16:55----------
[Music]

---------17:00----------
[Music]

---------17:09----------
Chandler can only have three

---------17:10----------
notifications per 24 hours interesting

---------17:30----------
nice or suck sick come on

---------17:35----------
there we go

---------17:42----------
okay that's beautiful let's see if we

---------17:47----------
get a picture

---------18:42----------
to keep in my mouth holding the board by

---------18:44----------
the heatsink I'm using my fingers so I

---------18:46----------
should be the heatsink is really just

---------18:48----------
there to hear that kind of guide it but

---------18:52----------
I'm holding it under with my index

---------18:53----------
finger and my thumb no you don't want to

---------18:56----------
hold this board directly by the heatsink

---------18:57----------
that's not nice

---------18:59----------
transit the MacBook hasn't really earned

---------19:02----------
me being nice to it you know it's a

---------19:05----------
privilege not a right

---------19:11----------
now let's see if this little thing boots

---------19:14----------
all I'm really interested right now is

---------19:16----------
having a screen plugged in on my dcn

---------19:18----------
board so we can see if we get the Apple

---------19:21----------
logo also I might as well do this to get

---------19:25----------
rid of some crotch cam that's some

---------19:28----------
crotch cam right there all right let's

---------19:33----------
see the amperage that it's taking

---------19:47----------
okay we got an Apple logo and it's

---------19:49----------
booting so let's take a look at what

---------19:52----------
that ship that was nasty was for and

---------19:54----------
also at the bottom right corner of the

---------19:56----------
jtag connector is four and see how that

---------19:57----------
will contribute to a turning on but not

---------19:59----------
giving us an image it's opened up a

---------20:02----------
schematic and a board view for an eight

---------20:03----------
to zero

---------20:04----------
- thirty four seventy six which is for

---------20:07----------
an a 1502 MacBook Pro over here we have

---------20:12----------
Paul Daniels of software so first issue

---------20:16----------
was with you 1950 a common spot for

---------20:19----------
corrosion on the a 1466 and a 1502

---------20:22----------
MacBook Pro if you take a look over here

---------20:24----------
this is for PCH power okay generation so

---------20:27----------
this is - logic gates in one so if we

---------20:30----------
just zoom in on the PDF because I don't

---------20:31----------
need the board view alright now if you

---------20:33----------
take a look at just the PDF all right so

---------20:38----------
PCH power okay this is - logic gates if

---------20:41----------
you have the inputs you get the output

---------20:42----------
and to power the logic gate you have PP

---------20:45----------
3 before to underscore g3 huh a

---------20:47----------
three-point 42 volt power rail now on

---------20:51----------
the first set of the logic first part of

---------20:53----------
the logic gate if all says power good in

---------20:56----------
CPU VR power go to present you get p.m.

---------20:59----------
sop good and then over here if p.m. sop

---------21:01----------
good is present along with SMC delay

---------21:03----------
power good which is going to come from

---------21:04----------
the SMC you get sis power okay this s is

---------21:09----------
also going to become p.m. PCH power okay

---------21:12----------
now if we look that up that's in the

---------21:14----------
system power management section of the

---------21:16----------
PCH now what happens here is when you

---------21:21----------
have all the inputs on the left you'll

---------21:23----------
get the outputs on the right these need

---------21:26----------
to show up for you to have this stuff

---------21:27----------
over here and what do you see over here

---------21:30----------
p.m. sleep s5l p.m. sleep s4l p.m. sleep

---------21:33----------
s3 oh these are all the signals that

---------21:35----------
were often hunting in order to get rails

---------21:37----------
like PP foot 3 v 3 s 5 PP 5 es 4 PP 5 es

---------21:41----------
3 PP 5 ESO it'd be 3 V 3 s 3 p b3 b3

---------21:44----------
yourself all the rails that we need in

---------21:46----------
order for the computer to work are

---------21:47----------
turned on by p.m. sleep as 5 LS 4 l and

---------21:51----------
s 3 up and those are not gonna be

---------21:53----------
present if we don't have the signals in

---------21:55----------
the left so what most likely happened

---------21:57----------
the reason this was able to turn on is

---------21:58----------
because those signals were present

---------22:00----------
for a very short period of time but as

---------22:02----------
you could see you is literally hanging

---------22:03----------
on by a thread

---------22:04----------
when I removed that chip there was a

---------22:06----------
chunk of dirty rotted away crap under

---------22:10----------
there and that was what was conducting

---------22:12----------
electricity intermittently to allow that

---------22:14----------
to work that's why you saw it go to 500

---------22:16----------
milliamps 300 100 milliamps 24 100

---------22:19----------
milliamps 300 ohms 524 it was doing that

---------22:22----------
because it was barely able to stay on

---------22:24----------
this is why having a power supply is so

---------22:27----------
useful and when using the power supply

---------22:29----------
as a Mac safe because when I use the

---------22:30----------
power supply as my MagSafe I'm able to

---------22:33----------
see how much power the board is drawing

---------22:35----------
and it does tell me something about what

---------22:37----------
it's doing so that tells me it must be

---------22:38----------
something intermittent somewhere and

---------22:39----------
that's what it was it was my you 1950

---------22:41----------
area and if you're interested if you

---------22:44----------
want to know where you can get a you

---------22:45----------
1950 chip let me not do you a disservice

---------22:48----------
and keep stored on Rossmann group comm a

---------22:51----------
secret so if you want to find this chip

---------22:56----------
you can go to start at Rosberg group

---------22:58----------
comm that's now shipping again at normal

---------23:00----------
speeds because we're done moving mostly

---------23:03----------
done moving store dot Rossman group comm

---------23:06----------
and type in the top you 1950 and wow it

---------23:13----------
shows up just like that and it tells you

---------23:16----------
the board is compatible with like eight

---------23:17----------
to zero 34 76 8 to 0 35 36 8 to 0 0 0 1

---------23:21----------
6 4 65 to 84 0 34 35 and eight to zero

---------23:25----------
34 37 it tells you exactly what its

---------23:29----------
compatible with and it even gives you a

---------23:30----------
picture that you can see the best part

---------23:34----------
when you buy a chip from store dot

---------23:35----------
Rossville group com you got that warm

---------23:37----------
and fuzzy feeling that it's going

---------23:39----------
towards getting nice food for oreo mr.

---------23:42----------
Clinton a blackberry a cookie for Erica

---------23:44----------
and tissues for my employees to wipe

---------23:47----------
their tears that's it for today and as

---------23:50----------
always I hope you learned something

---------23:52----------
see you in the next video
