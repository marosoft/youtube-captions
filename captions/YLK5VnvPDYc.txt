---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be going over a

---------00:01----------
board that is working off of the battery

---------00:03----------
but not off of the charger now there are

---------00:05----------
a couple of things that can cause this

---------00:06----------
to happen and I want to go over them

---------00:08----------
today I also want to go home because I

---------00:11----------
feel sick to my stomach

---------00:13----------
what are you gonna do first common thing

---------00:16----------
that happens here

---------00:17----------
well first common thing that happens is

---------00:19----------
open broadcaster forgets that I want to

---------00:21----------
capture the 4k screen at the open

---------00:22----------
broadcaster screen no foe the first

---------00:28----------
thing that happens here very often is

---------00:30----------
that PP 3 before 2 is not working pp 3

---------00:33----------
before 2 is a power supply it's a 3.42

---------00:35----------
or power supply that can be powered off

---------00:37----------
of one of two elements it can be powered

---------00:39----------
off of PP bus g3 hot which is the

---------00:42----------
battery or PPA 18 V 5 DC n which is your

---------00:44----------
charger so often if it's working off the

---------00:46----------
charger but not off of the battery or

---------00:48----------
the battery burn off the charger one of

---------00:49----------
the things that I would check is to see

---------00:51----------
the pp 3 before 2 is there on this board

---------00:53----------
pp 3 before 2 is present so I'm not

---------00:56----------
quite sure as to why I'm not getting

---------00:58----------
voltage that I'm supposed to now I don't

---------01:00----------
get a green light on my charger so

---------01:02----------
that's something I'm gonna have to

---------01:03----------
troubleshoot via the one wire circuit

---------01:05----------
which I've talked about in numerous

---------01:06----------
older videos so if you don't know how

---------01:08----------
the one wire circuit works you should

---------01:09----------
definitely check out the one wire

---------01:11----------
circuit videos you have an idea of what

---------01:12----------
the one wire circuit is and what it does

---------01:15----------
so I'm supposed to have smc bc AC ok

---------01:18----------
over here this signal supposed to be

---------01:20----------
present at this logic gate so that this

---------01:22----------
logic gate can pass 3.42 volts onto this

---------01:24----------
chip so that this chip could allow

---------01:26----------
whereas for you to talk to my SMC sis

---------01:30----------
one wire goes to the SMC so let's

---------01:32----------
measure on pins one and two of you 6901

---------01:35----------
which means first then I must find them

---------01:37----------
so on pins what I have to go back

---------01:41----------
because I forgot the numbers of the pins

---------01:42----------
I can just do this I can use the Nets

---------01:46----------
feature I hit the end button and that's

---------01:49----------
going to show me all the points on this

---------01:51----------
board that SMC bc AC ok show up alright

---------01:57----------
so that's gonna be over there now we're

---------02:02----------
gonna go over to the microscope here and

---------02:04----------
get to measuring

---------02:09----------
three it's kind of going back and forth

---------02:13----------
and my is l6 two five nine is only

---------02:18----------
giving me 1.8 volts on PP bus to you

---------02:21----------
three hot now there's no can't be a

---------02:26----------
short to ground on PP bus g3 hot because

---------02:30----------
the battery works now well my head

---------02:40----------
alright so before I put this in the

---------02:45----------
ultrasonic cleaner there were some

---------02:48----------
schmutz are over there and that leads to

---------02:52----------
it powers the use 7000 so what if the

---------02:56----------
7000 is not doing what it's supposed to

---------02:58----------
so I've measured here I'm getting four

---------03:00----------
volts a charger ACN just to show you

---------03:03----------
what that is for let's go to the you

---------03:04----------
7000 circuit here well I am dead

---------03:11----------
one thing that sucks about being the

---------03:13----------
only one that fixes boys at your

---------03:14----------
business is no days off hmm

---------03:21----------
so are 7010 are seventy eleven the way

---------03:25----------
this circuit works is the power comes

---------03:27----------
into the charger it goes through here

---------03:29----------
and then four volts goes to charger AC n

---------03:31----------
then after it goes to charger AC in you

---------03:34----------
get three volts and charger AC okay

---------03:36----------
which I do now I measured four volts

---------03:38----------
over there that's good after the diode

---------03:41----------
is supposed to be a 20 ohm resistor that

---------03:43----------
sends that sends power to the you 7,000

---------03:48----------
all right so I should even though I to

---------03:52----------
check could see that there was both a

---------03:54----------
there I still should check that resistor

---------03:57----------
which is what I will do right now so I

---------04:02----------
checked the resistor and I get 21.73

---------04:08----------
kilo ohm

---------04:11----------
okay so what did I just check here so

---------04:17----------
back through the microscope so that

---------04:20----------
resistor that r700 five so see this with

---------04:25----------
a diode with the three legs

---------04:26----------
see this one two three and then that's

---------04:30----------
the resistor and there that from there

---------04:32----------
it leads to the is L six two five nine

---------04:34----------
which is you seven thousand now I do

---------04:36----------
this I get twenty to kill homes and

---------04:42----------
that's not a recommended value so I'm

---------04:49----------
gonna get up that was harder than I

---------04:52----------
expected and get a donor board and

---------04:57----------
ripped that resistor off and I also

---------04:59----------
might as well get a donor board that has

---------05:00----------
a good you seven thousand on it because

---------05:03----------
if there was a voltage spike there

---------05:04----------
there's a chance that my you seven

---------05:07----------
thousand ship is dead so let's just make

---------05:16----------
sure that I'm not losing it and just

---------05:17----------
measure that resistor on my donor board

---------05:19----------
so when I measure that resistor on the

---------05:22----------
donor board twenty oaks which means that

---------05:33----------
it is indeed [ __ ] on this one let's

---------05:36----------
turn on the soldering in the rework

---------05:38----------
station

---------05:39----------
so the rework station is on

---------05:50----------
that's the resistor

---------05:57----------
goodbye

---------06:04----------
I should wait for my hot air to get hot

---------06:06----------
before doing that but I would like to

---------06:10----------
get this done as quickly as possible so

---------06:12----------
I don't pass out in the middle of the

---------06:14----------
repair so we are racing the clock on

---------06:22----------
this one okay now we take the resistor

---------06:36----------
from the donor board

---------06:45----------
by the way this is why it really sucks

---------06:49----------
to do business like this with other

---------06:50----------
businesses that clean this [ __ ] first

---------06:52----------
could you see since I was the first

---------06:54----------
point of contact with this board I got

---------06:56----------
to see that there was nonsense on that

---------06:59----------
diode which allowed me to run over to

---------07:01----------
this area and then when I ran over to

---------07:04----------
the area an idea of where to start

---------07:05----------
looking that that old resistor like that

---------07:08----------
that thing look you have to realize that

---------07:10----------
old resistor looked fine I saw nothing

---------07:12----------
wrong with that resistor when you look

---------07:14----------
at that resistor post ultrasonic you're

---------07:16----------
not going to notice anything wrong with

---------07:17----------
it either there's a lot of components on

---------07:19----------
this board there's a lot of pieces that

---------07:21----------
you're gonna have to narrow narrow down

---------07:23----------
to and it's annoying when your ability

---------07:26----------
to narrow it down has been taken away by

---------07:28----------
somebody else and it adds insult to

---------07:31----------
injury when they make it harder and then

---------07:36----------
they ask for a lower bill than the

---------07:40----------
retail customers that don't make it

---------07:42----------
harder so if you're sending boards to a

---------07:45----------
place like this and you clean them first

---------07:48----------
please have the common courtesy to mark

---------07:50----------
the board where that stuff is so that

---------07:54----------
it's easier for us to know what's going

---------07:58----------
on with it so we have a green light

---------08:01----------
bita and we have a fan spinning which is

---------08:05----------
something we didn't have before and

---------08:06----------
again I'm good at this at this point so

---------08:10----------
I'm gonna figure that out regardless of

---------08:11----------
whether there's a little mark there it's

---------08:13----------
just a question of whether I'm able to

---------08:14----------
offer you a turnaround time of this or a

---------08:16----------
turnaround time of who the hell knows so

---------08:21----------
just something to think about and that's

---------08:23----------
that for today so just to go back over

---------08:25----------
to the schematic here what was wrong

---------08:29----------
with this board is r700 v was blown and

---------08:35----------
there was some type of liquid damage

---------08:37----------
that was in this area that caused it

---------08:39----------
this is where the 16 volts comes in from

---------08:41----------
the charger and then goes to the charger

---------08:44----------
DC and pen of the u 7000 ship which

---------08:48----------
again there's no datasheet for this

---------08:50----------
there's no datasheet for this so you

---------08:52----------
have to guess on everything but VDD here

---------08:54----------
has no source so VDD and vtdp are you

---------08:57----------
those it usually depends that

---------08:58----------
but he used to turn the chip on and the

---------09:01----------
problem we have here is that there is no

---------09:04----------
source for that pp5 you are in charge of

---------09:05----------
EDD that's not created by anything on

---------09:07----------
the machine like this is it doesn't come

---------09:10----------
from anywhere or perhaps it does it does

---------09:19----------
I'm losing my mind I need to go home and

---------09:23----------
go to sleep

---------09:24----------
anyway so where where I was before I

---------09:27----------
completely forgot what I was talking

---------09:29----------
about is peepee charger DC in this this

---------09:33----------
needs to be here and this needs to be 16

---------09:34----------
volts this here can measure this here

---------09:44----------
can measure 16 volts and still not work

---------09:46----------
if this resistor is 2.2 kilohms so the

---------09:49----------
way this needs to work is this needs to

---------09:51----------
receive a certain amount of amperage on

---------09:52----------
the DC and pin it needs to be able to

---------09:54----------
receipt to receive enough energy to

---------09:56----------
power on so I'm going to open a new

---------09:57----------
incognito window we're gonna go to the

---------09:59----------
Ohm's law calculator so 16 volts at 20

---------10:03----------
ohms has the capability to deliver C 16

---------10:07----------
volts 12 point 8 Watts now let's say

---------10:15----------
that you're at 2000 ohms you have the

---------10:18----------
ability to deliver point 1 watts which

---------10:20----------
is not going to make that thing very

---------10:23----------
happy so that's it for today and as

---------10:26----------
always I hope you learned something
