---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna be

---------00:01----------
working on an a 1534 that was sent in

---------00:03----------
from one of those lovely mall franchises

---------00:05----------
as the note says we are shipping the

---------00:07----------
following a 1534 12-inch MacBook early

---------00:10----------
2016

---------00:11----------
drawstring repaired groupon 5/8 2018 -

---------00:14----------
have the USB C charging port diagnosed

---------00:16----------
and repaired there was a previous

---------00:17----------
attempt to repair the device M

---------00:20----------
shut up fall there was a previous

---------00:23----------
attempt to repair the device by

---------00:24----------
replacing the charging port flex and the

---------00:26----------
u 4700 as seen in a video by rossman

---------00:30----------
thank you for that thank you and they

---------00:34----------
posted here the original chip now the

---------00:37----------
reason this is scary to me is that my

---------00:38----------
video on the a 1534 macbook and its flaw

---------00:42----------
is concerning the 2015 model not the

---------00:45----------
2016 model so why you took that chip off

---------00:48----------
when this video was on the 2015 model is

---------00:52----------
beyond me

---------00:54----------
so let's take let's take a look and see

---------00:56----------
if this is the 2016 model and let's see

---------00:59----------
what we can do you gotta be careful so

---------01:01----------
first you gotta open it up like this

---------01:03----------
then you gotta open up the bottom very

---------01:05----------
carefully cuz this little cable see this

---------01:08----------
cable this is a trap laid by Apple so if

---------01:10----------
you do not disconnect this cable all the

---------01:12----------
machine is half open if you wait to open

---------01:14----------
the Machine entirely before unplugging

---------01:15----------
things you will rip the cable this is

---------01:18----------
indeed the 2016 model you can tell by

---------01:22----------
the USB see I see over here the CD 3215

---------01:25----------
this is in the 2016 model not the 15

---------01:29----------
model first things first let's turn on

---------01:31----------
the multimeter plug in my USB C charger

---------01:34----------
first thing I want to do see how much

---------01:35----------
voltage is showing up on the main power

---------01:39----------
line which is the input fuse riot over

---------01:41----------
here is our charging port J 9600 which

---------01:45----------
we sell by the way if you have a

---------01:46----------
break-in on store doc Rossman group comm

---------01:48----------
and we're gonna look up J 9600 over here

---------01:50----------
and J 9600 is going to have a power line

---------01:55----------
EPV bus Li oh there we go

---------01:58----------
and that's gonna go through F 3050 F 30

---------02:02----------
50 is this fuse right over here so let's

---------02:04----------
see how much voltage we get on that fuse

---------02:06----------
alright as you can see we have some mall

---------02:08----------
mall Messer II over here okay so this is

---------02:12----------
this does not look like it's plugged in

---------02:15----------
right this piece of metal instead of

---------02:17----------
being slid under here is screwed right

---------02:20----------
over this that's all bent I'll do the

---------02:23----------
first measurement but I'm not expecting

---------02:24----------
this to even be plugged in properly at

---------02:26----------
this point so at the input fuse we get

---------02:29----------
five point two volts now remember we're

---------02:32----------
supposed to be getting something along

---------02:33----------
the lines of 20 which means that

---------02:34----------
communication is not occurring mall

---------02:36----------
shops are not all the time but a lot of

---------02:39----------
the times the worst all right so the

---------02:41----------
first thing that scares me is they said

---------02:42----------
that they replaced you 4700 and I don't

---------02:47----------
even know if this board has au 4700 so

---------02:50----------
let's go ahead and figure out what the

---------02:51----------
[ __ ] they did so u 4700 on this board is

---------02:56----------
it doesn't exist what the [ __ ] did you

---------03:01----------
replace tell me what did you replace it

---------03:04----------
says I replaced you 4700 we this is

---------03:12----------
there was a previous attempt to repair

---------03:13----------
the device by repairing by replacing the

---------03:15----------
charging port flex and u 4700 as seen in

---------03:18----------
a video by Rossmann where is U 4700

---------03:20----------
where is he 4705 a u 4700 where no

---------03:24----------
matches were found what the [ __ ] were

---------03:27----------
you doing why did my video did not say

---------03:31----------
to do this do not credit me with this

---------03:33----------
[ __ ] okay I'm just gonna start

---------03:38----------
looking around the board for [ __ ] that

---------03:39----------
looks burnt and assume that it was them

---------03:41----------
let's see let's let's do that [ __ ] [ __ ]

---------03:47----------
my videos do not teach you that's here

---------03:49----------
let me show you what my video teaches

---------03:51----------
you to do if you have the year prior to

---------03:53----------
this one so let's go over and find that

---------03:56----------
board schematics eight to zero zero zero

---------04:02----------
zero four five if you have this model

---------04:05----------
the 2015 model there is a u 4700 trip

---------04:10----------
that goes bad if you have a different

---------04:12----------
[ __ ] board different [ __ ] board

---------04:15----------
you do not replace a chip that doesn't

---------04:18----------
even exist what did you even do did you

---------04:20----------
just like look at this place possibly

---------04:23----------
have done like oh let's look up a butch

---------04:24----------
if that looks almost like that oiling

---------04:26----------
just

---------04:26----------
PETA what if you put a different chip

---------04:29----------
there than what's actually supposed to

---------04:30----------
go there what about that the [ __ ] am I

---------04:32----------
supposed to do there alright let's let's

---------04:35----------
look let's see

---------04:36----------
so okay you tell me when you see

---------04:39----------
something that looks like it was burned

---------04:40----------
and [ __ ] up by a mall wasn't the

---------04:47----------
original chip tapes the computer yes but

---------04:49----------
I have to figure out where it is on the

---------04:50----------
board cuz see watch check this out they

---------04:53----------
said they replaced you forty seven

---------04:54----------
hundred when I click this and I type you

---------04:56----------
forty seven hundred don't [ __ ] exist

---------05:00----------
it's not on this board what did you

---------05:03----------
replace where is the [ __ ] that you

---------05:04----------
replaced so now I'm gonna make the

---------05:07----------
assumption that if you're dumb enough to

---------05:08----------
replace a chip that doesn't exist you

---------05:09----------
probably do tum too dumb to solder it

---------05:11----------
properly which means that I should be

---------05:12----------
able to find it alright and here we go I

---------05:19----------
see a burned connector look at that

---------05:21----------
it's a burned connector which means that

---------05:23----------
somewhere nearby is probably your [ __ ]

---------05:25----------
soldering do I see cold solder joints

---------05:30----------
yes I do

---------05:32----------
alright it's this one it's this one

---------05:34----------
where you see cold solder joints a mall

---------05:37----------
repair shop is not far behind look at

---------05:42----------
this [ __ ] this [ __ ] [ __ ] alright so

---------05:46----------
that all right so now let's figure out

---------05:48----------
what the [ __ ] this is

---------05:49----------
so it says s 4 5 AV ok so what they did

---------05:53----------
is they put the u 4700 from the 2015

---------05:59----------
machine there what is that chip actually

---------06:01----------
for ok so according to the 2016 board

---------06:04----------
view that's u 1900 so let's see what u

---------06:09----------
1900 is ok so check this out this this

---------06:13----------
is this is [ __ ] great so what they

---------06:15----------
did on the 2015 model that chip is an SL

---------06:19----------
g 4 AP 645 AV on the 2016 model that is

---------06:24----------
a clock generator so this mall store

---------06:27----------
claims that my video told them to remove

---------06:30----------
a chip that is designed for

---------06:33----------
communication and replace it with a 25

---------06:35----------
megahertz clock generator oh it's just a

---------06:38----------
rectangle it looks the same

---------06:39----------
it's just like a Lego we could just take

---------06:41----------
this Lego and put it in that Lego well

---------06:43----------
I'm gonna take your parents pacemaker

---------06:45----------
and replace it with a remote control or

---------06:46----------
maybe like take your microwave and

---------06:48----------
replace it with a toaster take your

---------06:49----------
ultrasonic cleaner and replace it with

---------06:51----------
in and with a rifle you can't do that

---------06:53----------
you can't do that you can't do that

---------06:56----------
no no no no no you don't take this chip

---------07:00----------
and put it where this chip is supposed

---------07:02----------
to go this chip over here is used for

---------07:04----------
something else this over here has SPI

---------07:07----------
data lines it talks to the charger this

---------07:10----------
is a clock chip that generates a clock

---------07:13----------
signal this board this board is probably

---------07:17----------
junk now because you are an idiot and if

---------07:19----------
you're watching this and you said this

---------07:21----------
to me good I don't care if you think I'm

---------07:23----------
unprofessional

---------07:24----------
this is stupid don't destroy your

---------07:26----------
customers [ __ ] this this has the

---------07:29----------
customer data soldered onto the [ __ ]

---------07:31----------
board if you [ __ ] this up that customer

---------07:33----------
will never ever ever get their data back

---------07:36----------
ever again and that's because you are an

---------07:39----------
idiot and you shouldn't be doing this if

---------07:41----------
you don't know how to figure it out say

---------07:44----------
I don't [ __ ] know go to this place if

---------07:46----------
you don't know how to figure it out or

---------07:48----------
you're confused or if you can't read the

---------07:50----------
name of a [ __ ] chip to realize that

---------07:52----------
two rectangles are not the same just

---------07:53----------
because there's black little boxes

---------07:55----------
that's cool say hey I'm not sure don't

---------07:58----------
do this because you're [ __ ] with

---------07:59----------
people's data you can't get the data

---------08:01----------
back on this if you [ __ ] up the board

---------08:03----------
they're stuck sending this [ __ ] to

---------08:04----------
someplace like drive savers or something

---------08:06----------
where they're gonna charge them five or

---------08:07----------
forty thousand dollars to desolder the

---------08:09----------
crap and try to decrypt it and probably

---------08:11----------
fail as you can see from Jess's recent

---------08:13----------
video but why alright so first thing I

---------08:19----------
got to do is find a tooth I don't think

---------08:20----------
I even have that clock chip so I got to

---------08:22----------
find a donor mm and I got to find a

---------08:26----------
donor 2016 board or maybe I can reuse

---------08:29----------
the original ship that they have here

---------08:31----------
let's see so at least they included the

---------08:33----------
original chip scotch tape to the [ __ ]

---------08:36----------
machine

---------08:40----------
it's really sad because of the amount of

---------08:42----------
work that we put in on a regular basis

---------08:44----------
to make this industry look more

---------08:45----------
legitimate the amount of lobbying work

---------08:47----------
that we put in the amount of arguing

---------08:49----------
work that we put in the amount of

---------08:50----------
educational work we put in do you know

---------08:51----------
how frustrating it is to put that much

---------08:53----------
work and effort into a business and that

---------08:55----------
much effort into legitimizing your

---------08:57----------
ability to have a job when this is what

---------08:58----------
you do with it because somewhere out

---------09:06----------
there there's some Apple Lobby is saying

---------09:07----------
these people shouldn't be allowed to

---------09:08----------
work on this stuff we should be

---------09:10----------
confiscating all their parts at the

---------09:11----------
border we should be suing them for this

---------09:13----------
that and the other and when I see [ __ ]

---------09:17----------
like this it's like yeah yeah they got a

---------09:19----------
point

---------09:19----------
people like shouldn't be allowed to work

---------09:21----------
on people's [ __ ] alright so

---------09:32----------
first thing I'm gonna do which they

---------09:34----------
didn't do is cover the keyboard

---------09:36----------
connector and trackpad connector with a

---------09:40----------
shield because if I cover it with a

---------09:42----------
shield I won't destroy it with hot air

---------09:43----------
while I'm replacing this chip on the

---------09:45----------
side this didn't mean there's no excuse

---------09:51----------
for this and to be clear I have no

---------09:53----------
problem with somebody saying I don't

---------09:54----------
know any I don't know any better this

---------09:56----------
ignorance is totally okay

---------09:58----------
it's just not okay to ruin people's

---------10:00----------
stuff when you you're aware you have no

---------10:02----------
idea what you're doing you know you're

---------10:04----------
probably making it worse you don't even

---------10:06----------
have the presence of mind to read the

---------10:07----------
numbers on the top of the chip you don't

---------10:09----------
have the presence of mind to look for

---------10:10----------
the schematic to find out that this chip

---------10:12----------
is not the same chip that's [ __ ] lazy

---------10:17----------
and stupid and irresponsible

---------10:23----------
that is just king lazy and irresponsible

---------10:27----------
there's no reason for it there's

---------10:30----------
absolutely no reason for this [ __ ]

---------10:39----------
okay chip is off

---------11:15----------
it

---------11:21----------
TCR s as I hope that chip didn't kill

---------11:23----------
the CPU I don't think it would because

---------11:25----------
the the communication chip that was put

---------11:28----------
there is really just for communication I

---------11:30----------
don't think it does it's not a power

---------11:32----------
creation chip if who was a power

---------11:34----------
creation chip I could see how putting a

---------11:35----------
power creation chip where the clock chip

---------11:38----------
is supposed to go could kill the CPU but

---------11:39----------
I don't think this would kill this I

---------11:40----------
don't think what they did necessarily

---------11:42----------
kill the CPU you for a communication

---------11:45----------
chip to kill the CPU as opposed to a

---------11:47----------
power chip it would have to kill the CPU

---------11:49----------
by hurting the CPUs feelings I don't I

---------11:54----------
think it's really hard to hurt this

---------11:56----------
machine's feelings

---------12:01----------
all right it's about as good as we're

---------12:03----------
gonna get so now let's see what we get

---------12:08----------
when we plug it in

---------12:11----------
[Music]

---------12:25----------
so charge your input 20 volts good so

---------12:30----------
you got charging CPU v core is zero

---------12:34----------
volts wait I had to add a little spike

---------12:38----------
there for a moment

---------12:39----------
hey-oh point five okay so we've got what

---------12:43----------
yeah there we go turn it on all right so

---------12:49----------
now the next thing I got to do is see if

---------12:51----------
it'll charge your battery this is pretty

---------12:56----------
cool

---------12:56----------
CPU v core bada-bing bada-boom

---------13:02----------
will you recognize a battery within the

---------13:05----------
operating system what did the shopping

---------13:06----------
mall replace the clock chip with they

---------13:08----------
replace the clock chip with this so they

---------13:10----------
replaced this which is the clock chip

---------13:14----------
with this which is for something else

---------13:20----------
entirely

---------13:21----------
charger communication bi-directional

---------13:23----------
data line with charger that's no good

---------13:26----------
we're gonna put this back together and

---------13:28----------
see if we have something resembling a

---------13:30----------
working computer let's make this macbook

---------13:32----------
great again they converted this macbook

---------13:35----------
to a pc i'm gonna convert it back to a

---------13:37----------
macbook remember we still got him asiya

---------13:40----------
that make sure that it can charge a

---------13:41----------
battery my my guess is that what

---------13:44----------
happened here is the original charge

---------13:46----------
port was bad they replaced the charge

---------13:48----------
port with a good charge port but because

---------13:50----------
they didn't plug it in properly it

---------13:51----------
wasn't charging so then they thought let

---------13:53----------
me look on YouTube for how to fix not

---------13:55----------
charging and then saw me replace a

---------13:57----------
rectangle on the board so they replaced

---------13:58----------
that rectangle on the board with an

---------14:00----------
entirely different rectangle and had a

---------14:02----------
charging port not plugged in and then

---------14:04----------
gave up that makes sense so I think this

---------14:07----------
may have actually never had a charging

---------14:09----------
problem when it was sent here it had a

---------14:11----------
charging problem when the customer

---------14:12----------
originally brought it to this to this

---------14:14----------
store and here's the really sad and

---------14:16----------
screwed up part of this right should I'm

---------14:18----------
gonna be charging this store for bored

---------14:20----------
repair they are gonna be charging their

---------14:22----------
customer at the very least what I'm

---------14:24----------
charging them so if this customer had

---------14:27----------
come to any other store all they would

---------14:28----------
have needed was a charge port and all

---------14:30----------
they would have paid for was a charge

---------14:31----------
port this stores customer is likely

---------14:34----------
going to be paying for board repair that

---------14:35----------
they did not need until they brought it

---------14:37----------
to the store which is ridiculously

---------14:39----------
unfair

---------14:39----------
but the way the world works all right so

---------14:41----------
it says 1% cover up the name let's see

---------14:46----------
if it charges so we're at 1% and I'm

---------14:48----------
gonna want to see if it gets to higher

---------14:50----------
than 1% I'm gonna leave it here for a

---------14:54----------
little bit and go off to do something

---------14:56----------
else and I'll be right back in a few

---------14:58----------
minutes all right let's see if this

---------14:59----------
thing charged so we started at 1% and it

---------15:03----------
looks like we are up to 5% now the one

---------15:06----------
way to check and ensure that this is

---------15:08----------
actually charging and not fake charging

---------15:09----------
is to unplug the charger and see if the

---------15:14----------
machine remains on so I'm gonna unplug

---------15:17----------
my charger and see if it remains on does

---------15:19----------
and it actually jumped up to 6% so now

---------15:22----------
it's on and it is able to charge the

---------15:24----------
battery and everything works so that is

---------15:28----------
how you fix a machine that was [ __ ] up

---------15:30----------
by a terrible mall franchise that's it

---------15:33----------
for today and as always I hope you

---------15:35----------
learned something

---------15:40----------
this across the street is the ninth

---------15:44----------
Avenue Apple store this is prime retail

---------15:49----------
space available are you thinking what

---------15:51----------
I'm thinking

---------15:56----------
how do I look like inside of my new

---------15:58----------
store can we see how look there's you

---------16:04----------
there's the Apple store this would be a

---------16:09----------
perfect location huh all right now we're

---------16:14----------
getting a little too far for fun but

---------16:15----------
it's just too tempting it's like we're

---------16:18----------
it's right here

---------16:18----------
got another one why are all these places

---------16:21----------
going out of business right next to the

---------16:23----------
Apple store it's like they're calling it

---------16:28----------
this can't be a coincidence I think I

---------16:39----------
could afford to have that space right

---------16:40----------
across from the Apple store that would

---------16:43----------
be great that would be too good I won't

---------16:45----------
have a nice big sign and have somebody

---------16:47----------
standing over there pointing people over

---------16:48----------
there

---------16:52----------
yeah Sam I have a sandwich board person

---------16:53----------
right here what do you think that's not

---------17:00----------
that's not going to attract a lot of

---------17:01----------
customers find out why are you that's

---------17:04----------
not good that's not gonna attract a lot

---------17:05----------
of customers come on 10 bucks an hour

---------17:11----------
what do you say Oh
