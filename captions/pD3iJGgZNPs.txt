---------00:02----------
all right so today we're going to start

---------00:04----------
with a liquid damaged Rena body somebody

---------00:08----------
donated here which is very nicely they

---------00:12----------
just went up and said you know I have

---------00:14----------
too much money and since I have too much

---------00:16----------
money I just kind of want to give this

---------00:17----------
way instead of selling it for hundred

---------00:18----------
dollars even though I don't really need

---------00:20----------
a new computer like soon when we turn it

---------00:23----------
on there's an image on the screen which

---------00:26----------
you'll never see what this shitty

---------00:27----------
camphor but I can but there's no

---------00:29----------
backlight so let's go about

---------00:31----------
troubleshooting the circuit now I've

---------00:32----------
said if you want to find a short in the

---------00:33----------
back blind circuit you can start from

---------00:35----------
the capacitor the diode on the other

---------00:37----------
side of the board from the backlight

---------00:38----------
output to ground diode mode or you can

---------00:41----------
check with resistance I prefer diode

---------00:43----------
mode and you can see what measurement

---------00:44----------
you get that was what I discussed in the

---------00:46----------
prior video on this one I'm just gonna

---------00:48----------
start from the top because the board is

---------00:50----------
already is still screwed in and honestly

---------00:52----------
I just don't feel like taking it out

---------00:53----------
right now I'm probing on the LVDS

---------00:55----------
connector the first thing I'm going to

---------00:56----------
do is check the fuse there is a fuse for

---------00:59----------
a 12 volt yeah you know we're 12 volts

---------01:03----------
goes through before it gets anywhere

---------01:05----------
else in the circuit that's this little

---------01:08----------
thing with the dot on it that looks like

---------01:10----------
 because this was liquid

---------01:13----------
this line

---------01:15----------
see that little thing with the dot on it

---------01:16----------
I'm going to point to you guys you're

---------01:18----------
black you can't see

---------01:24----------
I actually kind of like using the

---------01:25----------
oscilloscope just because I have the

---------01:27----------
little shitty alligator clips to them so

---------01:30----------
I don't have the hole both in my probe

---------01:31----------
is much smaller so I wound up using this

---------01:34----------
a lot even though the multimeter will

---------01:35----------
clearly do the job so on both sides of

---------01:38----------
my fuse I

---------01:42----------
12 volts and 12 volts

---------01:48----------
so the feels good

---------01:50----------
when the connector itself looks fun it's

---------01:53----------
not blowing up you know even though it

---------01:54----------
looks like and balls so next

---------01:58----------
I'm going to do is check backlight

---------01:59----------
enable a couple of things that you check

---------02:01----------
in the back light circuit is physical

---------02:03----------
damage like a broken LVDS connector

---------02:05----------
blown fuse usually because something in

---------02:07----------
there short in the ground or there's

---------02:09----------
something wrong with the basic circuit

---------02:11----------
that tells it to turn on so here you can

---------02:13----------
see the back light circuit and here you

---------02:15----------
see B Klem over here they're supposed to

---------02:18----------
be three volts but there is no three

---------02:21----------
volts here as I'm going to show you now

---------02:24----------
the way this works is you see also you

---------02:26----------
need Bikila to the power M enemies they

---------02:31----------
flip 4 so that is going to be 12 volts

---------02:34----------
and there is a FET on the other side

---------02:35----------
that's going to switch that off now are

---------02:37----------
nine seven three one nine nine seven

---------02:38----------
fifteen is a voltage divider network

---------02:40----------
that's going to turn that twelve volts

---------02:42----------
into three volts so let's see what we

---------02:43----------
get here now our nine seven fifteen and

---------02:47----------
our nine seven three one according to

---------02:52----------
this thing here let's plug in C we get

---------02:54----------
on nine seven three one nine seven

---------02:58----------
fifteen by the

---------02:59----------
bitching about the camera angle how

---------03:01----------
about you pay me so that I can hire a

---------03:03----------
 assistant the standard be my

---------03:05----------
cameraman thank you very much okay let's

---------03:08----------
see what we find

---------03:08----------
alright so it says that it's these two

---------03:10----------
right here so

---------03:15----------
let's see where we go now one of those

---------03:18----------
remember I'm supposed to be getting 12

---------03:19----------
volts from because that's going from 12

---------03:21----------
volts to the input of backlight enable

---------03:25----------
and as you can see I do get that 12

---------03:28----------
volts so there's a FET on the other side

---------03:31----------
of the board I believe it's on the other

---------03:33----------
side of the board on this one I honestly

---------03:34----------
don't even remember off the top my head

---------03:35----------
that gets us there's a FET on the other

---------03:38----------
side of the board that says whether or

---------03:40----------
not to send the 12 volts over here or

---------03:42----------
not so that I don't have to look through

---------03:43----------
that one because it already works that

---------03:45----------
FET was actually the problem in the

---------03:46----------
prior video there's a solder blob

---------03:48----------
on it on the other side of this I have

---------03:53----------
nothing because that's the end that's

---------03:54----------
going there now a voltage divider

---------03:56----------
circuit is going to be one resistor that

---------03:59----------
goes from the voltage you want to lower

---------04:01----------
to its destination and then from the

---------04:03----------
destination to ground and that's going

---------04:06----------
to do the voltage dividing so let's see

---------04:08----------
now yeah other resistor in the network

---------04:12----------
one of them is 301 K and one of the

---------04:17----------
I'm actually looking through the

---------04:19----------
viewfinder and I can't me

---------04:21----------
shitty viewfinder one of them is 100k

---------04:26----------
there we go like can't believe how shady

---------04:28----------
this few factories

---------04:31----------
so I'm going to try measuring them now

---------04:33----------
and try and measure gotta put some

---------04:37----------
tripod so you can see because I do need

---------04:39----------
both hands for this

---------04:44----------
I'm spending mr. wrong games can

---------04:51----------
we go

---------04:54----------
by the way if you want to measure the

---------04:56----------
resistance of something make sure to

---------04:57----------
turn the off booting awful they

---------05:01----------
drive with bad sectors that haze test

---------05:03----------
 so I don't go that I'm not

---------05:04----------
turning it off properly too close it's

---------05:07----------
already that's when I use it as

---------05:08----------
my test drive I can use something

---------05:11----------
obviously turn everything do not try to

---------05:14----------
measure resistance with on and just

---------05:16----------
don't don't don't do stupid don't

---------05:19----------
be lazy

---------05:21----------
all right so the first resistance

---------05:33----------
that did not work when he brought it and

---------05:35----------
it was flashing and blinking and booping

---------05:37----------
bopping

---------05:40----------
Oh

---------05:42----------
Marquess I'll promote you don't kill

---------05:45----------
this if you firm work that it's gonna

---------05:46----------
die say it was just leave it on like you

---------05:50----------
do some if you play a youtube video

---------05:52----------
it's gonna die thank you to be make sure

---------05:55----------
it's 360p or less play The Honeymooners

---------06:02----------
that smells or that smell that smells

---------06:05----------
worse than GPU so that's ten times worse

---------06:11----------
the GPU satiric good so this over here

---------06:14----------
is supposed to be it is really sad I'm

---------06:21----------
not standing my hands up

---------06:28----------
I think it's smaller probes for this

---------06:30----------
 thing

---------06:34----------
you could see I got through probs like

---------06:36----------
crazy I went offending them destroying

---------06:47----------
so this measures 106 colognes

---------06:57----------
and this measure is

---------07:00----------
17 and Counting kilohms and they're

---------07:03----------
supposed to be 301 K and 100 K which

---------07:07----------
means that this is I need to go

---------07:12----------
okay

---------07:15----------
it started

---------08:11----------
I'm putting this captain tape here

---------08:13----------
because I know that I'm going to wind up

---------08:14----------
burning the LVDS Maki

---------08:26----------
Venera it's 60 plus tax and give her the

---------08:28----------
protector but also read the notes

---------08:32----------
then you have to make sure to read the

---------08:33----------
notes

---------08:49----------
by

---------08:55----------
you read the notes in here

---------08:58----------
and so that you ready you read the notes

---------09:00----------
veneer Oh veneer that makes Steve reason

---------09:07----------
uh-huh excellent

---------09:17----------
okay so I left the side around the tip

---------09:20----------
of my iron which actually just came off

---------09:21----------
and burned my finger

---------09:30----------
and I can't see because I'm soldering

---------09:32----------
viewfinder over $100 camera

---------09:36----------
so now I have to find the 100 then the

---------09:39----------
301 kilometres

---------10:54----------
all right so I have another board here

---------10:56----------
that has the 101 and green to 1k ohm

---------10:58----------
resistor which is close enough for this

---------11:00----------


---------11:43----------
I'm gonna eventually wind up getting one

---------11:45----------
of those cameras that you could put

---------11:46----------
inside the microscope so that I can

---------11:49----------
actually see what I'm doing because not

---------11:50----------
only can I not do this in the microscope

---------11:52----------
in order for you to see it in the candle

---------11:53----------
but I actually have to use the camera as

---------11:56----------
my as the as a microscope and that's

---------12:00----------
really awful

---------12:07----------
okay

---------12:09----------
in phones and it actually straight

---------12:22----------
your residency sparks fire excitement

---------12:35----------
okay back to the moment of truth

---------12:58----------
Oh

---------13:25----------
then we're done

---------13:51----------
and if I point to it on you so that's

---------13:53----------
good

---------13:58----------
keeping the probe on there and this is

---------14:01----------
all this is family how this is felon

---------14:04----------
let's just take it off the track

---------14:24----------
two volts 2.8 it really doesn't matter

---------14:27----------
as long as there's something that other

---------14:28----------
than zero here we have 2.8 and we're

---------14:32----------
good
