---------00:08----------
Wow so I have a I have a mic what is

---------00:12----------
this oh I was muted your mic we try this

---------00:27----------
again Eric Erica what is this you're

---------00:33----------
holding us for a friend right this is

---------00:37----------
yours bye

---------00:46----------
okay so we are gonna try and fix this

---------00:49----------
MacBook so what is wrong with this

---------00:55----------
MacBook what does it do

---------01:04----------
it's beeping it's beeping now both

---------01:08----------
beeping before

---------01:09----------
oh yeah the only way I think that is I

---------01:13----------
have to unplug the battery and we plug

---------01:15----------
it back in

---------01:16----------
that's the only way I got rid of it the

---------01:17----------
beeping yeah okay so it turns on all

---------01:23----------
right taking seven hundred milliamps and

---------01:24----------
as you can see we don't have a logo on

---------01:26----------
the screen let's take a look at this

---------01:28----------
MacBook let's see if we can make it work

---------01:29----------
the first thing that I see here is that

---------01:31----------
the long screw has been inserted into

---------01:33----------
the short hole I did not do that then

---------01:38----------
who did well I know Apple repaired my

---------01:43----------
computer like at least three times

---------01:46----------
you brought your computer to Apple it um

---------01:51----------
I bought the computer in 2012 and it

---------01:54----------
went to Apple in 2013 and then it went

---------01:57----------
to Apple again in 2016 okay I got it I

---------02:01----------
got a funny story to tell you guys okay

---------02:02----------
so the reason why I went to Apple so

---------02:05----------
quickly the fan is not even like this

---------02:07----------
isn't this clip is not even held in good

---------02:10----------
this [ __ ] this one of the things

---------02:13----------
randomly crashing in kernel panic you

---------02:14----------
missed the fans gonna be intermittently

---------02:15----------
spinning because the latch and the

---------02:17----------
connector was not even close oh by the

---------02:18----------
way I do want to tell you that they did

---------02:20----------
replace that fan specifically yeah that

---------02:22----------
I can tell that they replace the fan

---------02:23----------
because it is not even latched into the

---------02:26----------
machine oh I can't believe you took it

---------02:31----------
to Apple Erica but I had Apple care I

---------02:35----------
can't believe you took it that

---------02:39----------
so you got long screwed and the stuff

---------02:41----------
not plugged in

---------02:45----------
okay

---------02:50----------
so let's open this up okay so about this

---------02:54----------
story okay so um I was drinking water or

---------03:00----------
something and something like a bug or

---------03:04----------
something had flown into my water while

---------03:05----------
I was talking to my friend so I wanted

---------03:07----------
to show my friend this bug and I was uh

---------03:09----------
I was talking to them on my webcam so

---------03:13----------
what I did is I I said hey can you see

---------03:15----------
the bug and I tipped it towards the

---------03:17----------
webcam and they said no I can't no I

---------03:19----------
can't

---------03:20----------
and then I tipped it even some more and

---------03:22----------
as you might have guessed the water

---------03:24----------
splashed all over the keyboard yeah and

---------03:27----------
that's how I got liquid damage on my

---------03:29----------
keyboard back in 2013 this is their okay

---------03:33----------
so see this screw is supposed to go over

---------03:37----------
here but they put it over there

---------03:39----------
and then they put the screw that's

---------03:40----------
supposed to go over there over there you

---------03:44----------
know what happens when you put the long

---------03:45----------
screw in the short hole tell me not good

---------03:52----------
things Hawaii needs a proper MacBook

---------03:57----------
repair shop we have actually only have a

---------04:00----------
Apple stores and then we also have Apple

---------04:02----------
certified repair places and that's about

---------04:04----------
it

---------04:05----------
disgusting practice let's get right back

---------04:09----------
to all this aside give me a ziploc bag

---------04:12----------
to put all the little pieces in all

---------04:16----------
right why didn't I get a think pad

---------04:22----------
because that was uh that was my second

---------04:25----------
laptop the first one I got was a HP

---------04:27----------
which is in my opinion a horrible

---------04:29----------
product I had it for six months and then

---------04:32----------
it gave me issues

---------04:47----------
now so backlight is gonna be somewhere

---------04:50----------
around here and surprisingly enough that

---------04:54----------
area is actually really good so this is

---------04:58----------
the backlight chip and the part that's

---------04:59----------
typically enough blow up is your

---------05:01----------
feedback ball right over there that

---------05:03----------
looks fine but we do have massive

---------05:09----------
corrosion on this section of the

---------05:11----------
backlight circuit

---------05:11----------
treat her like Kevin please what Jesus

---------05:15----------
Christ no okay we get the multimeter on

---------05:23----------
the screen and let's see if our

---------05:26----------
backlight fuse is good we are not gonna

---------05:32----------
treat her like Kevin you're gonna treat

---------05:33----------
her like an apple customer

---------05:35----------
Kevin make up an invoice for 325 plus

---------05:37----------
tax let's see

---------05:38----------
so our backlight fuse appears to be open

---------05:42----------
so this could be nothing but a backlight

---------05:43----------
fuse and I'm gonna guess that there's a

---------05:45----------
short two grounds over here

---------05:46----------
as a result yep let's see what do we

---------05:50----------
have there from yep zero ohms so this

---------05:55----------
little cap over here is probably

---------05:56----------
corroded so we just knock that thing off

---------05:57----------
the board and interesting our short

---------06:01----------
circuit is still there yeah so we got to

---------06:03----------
find out where that short circuit is

---------06:05----------
hiding so this is gone so it's are there

---------06:08----------
gonna be

---------06:09----------
now this capacitor over here as you can

---------06:11----------
see well so do you see this which one of

---------06:13----------
these capacitors is the one that you

---------06:15----------
think is damaged Erica if you had a

---------06:17----------
guess this one which is the grossest one

---------06:19----------
the blonde body okay what makes the

---------06:21----------
bottom right one grosser okay it has a

---------06:26----------
lot of corrosion and green cells what

---------06:30----------
else do you see there's something looks

---------06:34----------
wrong with the eye part that little chip

---------06:37----------
I have to guess see this that thing yes

---------06:40----------
there that's chipped so we're gonna

---------06:44----------
remove that and our short circuit will

---------06:45----------
most likely be gone and by me remove it

---------06:50----------
I mean you let's switch seats now it's

---------06:55----------
gonna be easy

---------06:56----------
don't worry about it it's only your

---------06:57----------
computer have a seat

---------07:01----------
it's gonna be fine okay so what you're

---------07:04----------
gonna do first thing I want you to do is

---------07:06----------
look in the microscope okay all right

---------07:10----------
can you see well yeah very good

---------07:12----------
now you're gonna hold that with your

---------07:15----------
left hand grab the tweezer

---------07:27----------
so now your left hand that's right hand

---------07:30----------
so left hand yep left hand grab tweezer

---------07:32----------
I mean and now left hand use the tweezer

---------07:35----------
to grab hold that capacitor okay but now

---------07:39----------
try to hold it from the red part so

---------07:40----------
you're gonna have to angle it instead of

---------07:42----------
it being like this

---------07:43----------
like this all right and try holding it

---------07:48----------
like this see how you're holding it

---------07:49----------
you're holding the tweezer like this try

---------07:51----------
holding like that so that no no I like

---------07:54----------
that see the tweezers are going up and

---------07:56----------
out rather than into my hand do that

---------08:06----------
okay

---------08:07----------
now you're gonna use your right hand

---------08:08----------
with this to heat that up until it gets

---------08:10----------
hot enough to remove it but you're gonna

---------08:12----------
hold this like you would hold this like

---------08:14----------
you hold a sharpie that your or a pen

---------08:17----------
right

---------08:25----------
yeah this the no snow soldering here

---------08:29----------
right now me you're gonna point this at

---------08:31----------
the capacitor not at other stuff okay

---------08:33----------
you're pointing at stuff okay Erica

---------08:37----------
watch you do this and you point you're

---------08:39----------
gonna point see this thing that's got a

---------08:41----------
point of the capacitor nice oh go you're

---------08:46----------
pointing at sunder boat listen I don't

---------08:49----------
care about thunderbolt much either

---------08:51----------
but now you're pointing at battery okay

---------08:56----------
yep look at the heat look at this okay

---------08:59----------
how about we just the [ __ ] we do

---------09:00----------
without the mic oh yeah they do it like

---------09:03----------
this yeah and heat the capacitor and not

---------09:07----------
other stuff so you want to point

---------09:08----------
straight down the board mm-hmm okay

---------09:12----------
you're gonna slowly go in on it yeah

---------09:16----------
okay now give it to me 20s there you go

---------09:19----------
came off okay put this back in there

---------09:23----------
no no they like this see like that

---------09:25----------
there you go now we're gonna see if it

---------09:31----------
stays on to cool itself off so now we're

---------09:33----------
gonna see if we still have a short

---------09:34----------
circuit so I want you to put one probe

---------09:36----------
on the Left pad and this on the right

---------09:38----------
pad that you just did that component

---------09:39----------
office

---------09:44----------
yep and your short circuits gone so you

---------09:46----------
fixed it all right now we need to

---------09:50----------
replace a fuse okay how do you feel

---------09:53----------
about replacing that small thing over

---------09:55----------
there without knocking the stuff around

---------09:57----------
okay you did have to work I'll do these

---------10:19----------
how many times have you started before I

---------10:25----------
[Music]

---------10:26----------
have never done this before in the words

---------10:29----------
of William Hung I have no training in

---------10:31----------
this us William huh-huh you ever watched

---------10:36----------
American Idol when he has his audition

---------10:38----------
yeah yeah at the end of it he kind of

---------10:41----------
looked down he's like you know I have no

---------10:42----------
I've never had a formal training thing

---------10:44----------
dudes made better money than I ever had

---------10:46----------
so I have all right we're gonna lick

---------10:50----------
those pads once I find my wick you

---------10:57----------
should always know the names of the

---------10:59----------
things of your tools that you can call

---------11:01----------
them when they get lost she didn't use

---------11:04----------
flux indeed she's learning from Paul

---------11:11----------
I have to say you know it definitely is

---------11:14----------
a lot smaller these these components

---------11:17----------
then I thought it sound so stupid for me

---------11:21----------
to say it that way

---------11:22----------
[Music]

---------11:30----------
so we're also going to have to address

---------11:32----------
those random kernel panics you're having

---------11:34----------
now how often does it beep and also when

---------11:36----------
it beeps is it three fast beeps or was

---------11:37----------
it three slow beeps uh it beeps maybe

---------11:39----------
once a month and I just unplugged the

---------11:41----------
battery in there now when it beeps is it

---------11:43----------
beep beep beep or is it beep beep

---------11:48----------
I forgot fast beeping or slow beeping

---------11:53----------
moderately beeping there's no such thing

---------11:56----------
as mother is beeping customer whatever I

---------12:01----------
wasn't earlier that beeping yeah and I'm

---------12:05----------
back backlight fused I stab you

---------12:11----------
now I have not had a bagel yet there's

---------12:14----------
so many bagel places here in New York -

---------12:16----------
all right we're gonna grab some countess

---------12:19----------
sitters you know I'm not even gonna use

---------12:21----------
a donor board just for you we're gonna

---------12:23----------
use new capacitor you can go ahead and

---------12:28----------
fix your MacBook if you go ahead and

---------12:29----------
send it to San your macbook comm you

---------12:32----------
remember me though not me if it was me

---------12:34----------
I'd be here until the age of til til

---------12:38----------
forever

---------12:38----------
way too long don't fly away little fuse

---------12:50----------
do not fly away I do I've been using a

---------12:53----------
MacBook since 2012 I had a HP and I

---------12:56----------
hated it

---------12:57----------
ok so this is what happened ok back in

---------12:59----------
about 2011 or so I wanted to get a

---------13:03----------
laptop my first laptop and I asked

---------13:04----------
people I said what should I get and I

---------13:06----------
was on the fence between you know an HP

---------13:09----------
and an apple and my computer friends

---------13:12----------
told me they said oh you know an apple

---------13:14----------
is better if you go ahead and get it but

---------13:16----------
the HP is good too HP was cheaper so I

---------13:19----------
got the HP I used it for about 6 months

---------13:21----------
and it was a horrible product I I flung

---------13:26----------
that computer away basically even though

---------13:28----------
it was factory reset several times it

---------13:29----------
was just terrible HP so then I went over

---------13:32----------
and I got a 2012 MacBook Air and that is

---------13:36----------
what's here today if you wanted me to

---------13:42----------
fix it and this would be a very very

---------13:44----------
long stream a very very long stream way

---------13:47----------
too long

---------13:57----------
[Music]

---------13:59----------
so my my laptop experience has only been

---------14:02----------
HP and Apple matza one but I do have to

---------14:07----------
say I brought this to the Apple store

---------14:09----------
about three or four times and all they

---------14:12----------
did was long screw you okay so the HP

---------14:16----------
what happened was is that it just got

---------14:18----------
incredibly slow I mean very very very

---------14:21----------
slow it was freezing on me the track

---------14:24----------
pack was bubbling up and what happened

---------14:27----------
was the side told HP I said hey can you

---------14:30----------
go ahead and cover this under warranty

---------14:31----------
and they said well they looked at a

---------14:33----------
picture of it and they said well you

---------14:34----------
know it's actually just normal wear and

---------14:35----------
tear and that torque that really um you

---------14:38----------
know turned me off so much when I heard

---------14:40----------
about that and they said if I if I sent

---------14:43----------
it in to them if they determined that it

---------14:45----------
wasn't their fault then I would be

---------14:46----------
charged for return shipping or some

---------14:48----------
point data that's reasonable

---------14:50----------
you know and I was like wait this is not

---------14:51----------
normal wearing hair this is you know

---------14:53----------
like a bubble the drive probably died I

---------14:56----------
don't know how much did you pay for that

---------14:58----------
HP I feels like seven hundred eight

---------14:59----------
hundred dollars yeah is she being a

---------15:02----------
customer stream I am being a customer

---------15:04----------
she is reasonably worshiping after that

---------15:07----------
after that I I determined that I did not

---------15:09----------
want to go ahead and support HP anymore

---------15:12----------
and I went over to the line of Apple and

---------15:14----------
I have five Apple products now but only

---------15:17----------
two of them work two or three of them

---------15:19----------
work yeah actually three of them work

---------15:20----------
that's number one we're done with this

---------15:21----------
huh nothing so random kernel panicking

---------15:26----------
let's see what else is there so we only

---------15:27----------
had corrosion on the LCD circuit I would

---------15:29----------
not expect that to cuts kernel panic

---------15:31----------
this may have kernel panicking because

---------15:33----------
rant

---------15:34----------
oh right by your BIOS chip look at your

---------15:40----------
SPI wrong Mac look if so many pubes on

---------15:43----------
it are you sure that isn't cat hair oh

---------15:49----------
don't you try to play that up the

---------15:52----------
[ __ ] well thank you wet it could be

---------15:56----------
another it could be a white cat you know

---------15:58----------
I would blame this on us also if it was

---------16:04----------
feathers I'd take full ownership on that

---------16:12----------
oh god this doesn't even have legs

---------16:14----------
anymore yeah what a mess

---------16:20----------
[Music]

---------16:22----------
all right

---------16:26----------
I said

---------16:29----------
Apple double Hosmer in his grasp don't

---------16:37----------
those three pads that they're just by

---------16:42----------
oh jesus yes he's still south I was so

---------16:46----------
alive and well and chirping he's safe in

---------16:48----------
Hawaii mr. Clinton's gonna be doing a

---------16:55----------
collaboration stream that sells a short

---------16:56----------
clip this poor little MacBook cierk is

---------17:01----------
another type of Mac owner that spill

---------17:03----------
something on it and then stops she just

---------17:04----------
keeps running electricity through that

---------17:06----------
venue you just keep putting electricity

---------17:09----------
through this thing day in day out I was

---------17:12----------
like you know what let's just let your

---------17:13----------
soldier on let's just soldier on without

---------17:15----------
even giving it a little bit of cleaning

---------17:17----------
what someone should call for one one on

---------17:20----------
you for abusive Apple products this is

---------17:23----------
me oh it's like if you brush your teeth

---------17:28----------
every day you're fine and when you go to

---------17:29----------
the dentist you need a normal cleaning

---------17:30----------
but if you never brush your teeth when

---------17:32----------
you go to the dentist you know what they

---------17:34----------
do so real so people are supposed to go

---------17:37----------
and bring their Mac books to get a

---------17:38----------
cleaning happy looks nice after you

---------17:40----------
spill something on it see because now I

---------17:43----------
have to scrape this is like going to the

---------17:44----------
dentist you hear that noise

---------17:49----------
if I'm gonna trigger some people that

---------17:51----------
are afraid of the dentist right now now

---------17:55----------
I did not feed that little bird to

---------17:57----------
Clinton or Blackberry he's very safe in

---------18:00----------
Hawaii

---------18:04----------
you should read the coming from Harrison

---------18:07----------
to brown I'm 15 I just want to thank

---------18:10----------
Lois for the inspiration to create my

---------18:11----------
own repair service here we go god damn

---------18:13----------
good job kid good job

---------18:15----------
I'm buddy get that get this

---------18:21----------
so I should have a link to an exacto

---------18:26----------
knife in the description that's similar

---------18:27----------
to that one

---------18:28----------
so now after that's done all our

---------18:30----------
scraping is done now it's time for our

---------18:31----------
squeak all right cleaning someone says I

---------18:33----------
feel that in my soul

---------18:34----------
indeed okay now my main concern is that

---------18:39----------
midday never feed him to Clinton the pad

---------18:41----------
may be okay but is the via that's

---------18:43----------
feeding it could it doesn't seem like

---------18:47----------
that's any good so I got to figure out

---------18:49----------
what that goes to later

---------18:57----------
okay so I'm

---------19:09----------
cameras potato yes I'm streaming at 1

---------19:11----------
megabit per second because of Time

---------19:12----------
Warner sorry I have a 20 megabit per

---------19:16----------
second connection and I can't stream 2

---------19:18----------
megabit without it crashing can we have

---------19:20----------
eight can we have eight oh no no no no

---------19:24----------
no drop rings oh god it's not taking it

---------19:27----------
I got greedy

---------19:34----------
that's on getting a girlfriend this is

---------19:36----------
the Renaissance thank you you know just

---------19:39----------
to work on this whole Mac user thing to

---------19:42----------
work in progress at the bottom pro point

---------19:44----------
does not look very nice either to love

---------19:49----------
with micro solder since Pedro Pedro is

---------19:51----------
an employee in 2012 he's a good guy all

---------19:59----------
right that's as clean as that stuff's

---------20:00----------
gonna get

---------20:02----------
[Music]

---------20:04----------
someone said once we have a female guest

---------20:06----------
that internet sucks yep

---------20:09----------
oh my god even at two megabit it's not

---------20:13----------
letting a stranger

---------20:14----------
I see how high heavy nine and do your

---------20:17----------
job all right so let's see what that

---------20:18----------
chip over here is for

---------20:27----------
open aboard you for an a20 3209 so

---------20:32----------
that's the thing right next to the BIOS

---------20:34----------
chip here PM sleep best 3l what do you

---------20:38----------
know SMC adapter enable ACN oh ok this

---------20:42----------
is Wi-Fi so wireless LAN enable

---------20:45----------
generation so what this is gonna do is

---------20:46----------
if ap power enable is present and SMC

---------20:50----------
adapter enable of presence and p.m.

---------20:51----------
sleep as3 ello present this is the

---------20:53----------
signal that tells the machine to turn on

---------20:54----------
and put all the power rails on to get in

---------20:56----------
an Esso state of being on this is when

---------20:58----------
the your power adapter is working and

---------21:00----------
this is when it's telling it an access

---------21:03----------
point power enable you're gonna get W

---------21:05----------
land and naval L and W land and able L

---------21:08----------
is going to go to this transistor oh god

---------21:16----------
what is this for

---------21:18----------
w and Abel L is probably gonna go to the

---------21:21----------
Wi-Fi card or something on the other

---------21:22----------
side I would expect it to goes to a

---------21:26----------
resistor here that goes to this what a

---------21:31----------
mix for creating 3.3 volts that goes

---------21:37----------
over to your Wi-Fi card lineman

---------21:41----------
interesting okay so that's why you don't

---------21:43----------
have Wi-Fi so let's get a replacement

---------21:47----------
transistor yeah I don't have I don't

---------21:49----------
know if I have this donor board because

---------21:51----------
it's so old but we may be able to grab

---------21:56----------
this part off of the donor so what is

---------21:58----------
your name - n700 - DW how does find a

---------22:04----------
doughnut you're right back yeah it's

---------22:07----------
actually a lot harder to do if you

---------22:10----------
caught it earlier you would have seen me

---------22:11----------
a fumbling big time I like I like New

---------22:20----------
York a lot I have to say though the

---------22:22----------
roads are definitely very bumpy in

---------22:24----------
certain areas there's a hopefully he

---------22:27----------
uploads a video with his Fang and that's

---------22:29----------
all I'm gonna say if you see it you will

---------22:32----------
you'll probably laugh I have seen the

---------22:35----------
basement it's actually a lot smaller

---------22:37----------
than it looks on camera

---------22:40----------
what's a lot smaller the basement oh

---------22:43----------
okay so this is the this is the board

---------22:47----------
we're grabbing parts from

---------22:52----------
nothing but the best for you Erica this

---------22:55----------
is the prize okay well I'm actually

---------22:58----------
riding behind him so I hope he stays off

---------23:01----------
these slippery metal plates

---------23:09----------
actually I have a Wi-Fi dong I already

---------23:13----------
threw that away oh yeah nice that

---------23:19----------
thing's a piece of [ __ ] oh I had a

---------23:20----------
little Wi-Fi done okay they didn't have

---------23:22----------
Wi-Fi the thing is it's broken

---------23:24----------
well the plastic part broke off it's a

---------23:27----------
dress that works it's gone

---------23:33----------
now we're gonna have to check out with

---------23:36----------
those corroded Pro points so there's one

---------23:38----------
over here PM sleep best uh BL you can

---------23:41----------
grab a wire to that one of these three

---------23:45----------
resistors over there

---------23:47----------
indeed at indeed thank you by the way so

---------23:51----------
we do this it went somewhere jumper

---------23:57----------
wires

---------24:07----------
actually I do have an iPhone 4 I'm not

---------24:10----------
kidding you I also have an iPhone se you

---------24:15----------
have an iPhone 4 can I have an iPhone 4

---------24:17----------
you can borrow mine I want and I don't

---------24:20----------
want to borrow it I want to own it that

---------24:21----------
was that glancing for I love that stuff

---------24:32----------
I think you should read this comment

---------24:34----------
right here quick gotta give you little

---------24:37----------
things I do volunteer work for two years

---------24:39----------
we're starting my own business in a

---------24:40----------
second here was a bit rough your videos

---------24:42----------
on depression really helped me do it

---------24:43----------
during that time and thank you very much

---------24:45----------
I'm really glad it got did you something

---------24:46----------
could use some good take long

---------24:49----------
alright so now I got a void in the

---------24:52----------
iPhone 4 video alright so we've got a

---------24:56----------
jumper wire now we have to run this to

---------24:59----------
where p.m. sleeve s3l is and that's

---------25:01----------
gonna be all the way on the other side

---------25:02----------
of this friggin mess over here

---------25:05----------
the [ __ ] of resistors under the

---------25:08----------
CPU

---------25:13----------
it's not raining outside it's very sunny

---------25:16----------
okay so we're gonna run you right here

---------25:21----------
[Music]

---------25:34----------
we can either run it to they're already

---------25:36----------
here

---------25:41----------
I should actually say we met at an Apple

---------25:43----------
store but we didn't

---------25:48----------
[Music]

---------26:07----------
I think you could probably buy one for

---------26:09----------
about $25 use I want an iPhone for

---------26:15----------
[Music]

---------26:34----------
she turned on a fan a bit so hot

---------26:39----------
[Music]

---------26:42----------
actually here's the here's something

---------26:44----------
interesting so we had a we don't want to

---------26:47----------
eat up out of vegan music I place and I

---------26:49----------
mentioned that he was eating apple

---------26:51----------
cinnamon oatmeal and after he realized

---------26:54----------
what I had disclosed online he no longer

---------26:56----------
eats at apple cinnamon oatmeal

---------27:10----------
you a rapture around here

---------27:15----------
some cash for the internet meaning thank

---------27:18----------
you

---------27:23----------
[Music]

---------27:30----------
okay what else do we have now there's

---------27:32----------
this whole point under there that could

---------27:35----------
[Music]

---------27:38----------
SMC adapter n okay so SMC adapter n is

---------27:42----------
really only present on SMC and on this

---------27:45----------
resistor on the other side of the board

---------27:47----------
really is that is that really broken or

---------27:53----------
yeah it looks like it's good good enough

---------27:55----------
for rock and roll okay so the first

---------27:57----------
thing we're gonna do is see if we have

---------27:58----------
backlight and after we see if we have

---------28:00----------
backlight I'd also like to see if we

---------28:01----------
have Wi-Fi

---------28:08----------
this thing's obviously gonna need an

---------28:10----------
ultra ah here we go this is probably

---------28:11----------
gonna be the cause of our kernel

---------28:12----------
panicking what is this green stuff over

---------28:15----------
here what's this little cluster because

---------28:16----------
the corrosion we had was by backlight

---------28:18----------
which is not gonna cross Colonel

---------28:19----------
panicking and Wi-Fi which is not gonna

---------28:21----------
go sternal panicking unless it was on

---------28:23----------
the card is the kernel panicking PCI

---------28:25----------
Express item could cause kernel

---------28:26----------
panicking but not kernel not on power

---------28:29----------
circuit over here let's see what this

---------28:31----------
that's for isolate CPU memory ooh

---------28:34----------
mem vtt enable an Allen this is stuff

---------28:36----------
that's gonna be enabling power for the

---------28:38----------
memory and your computer's every now and

---------28:40----------
then beeping right yeah it is it is so

---------28:42----------
if your computer's beeping every now and

---------28:44----------
then and the power it's a beeping

---------28:47----------
typically is ravishing so it's not

---------28:49----------
recognizing the RAM of the RAM as bed

---------28:51----------
and the corrosion here is around the

---------28:54----------
area responsible for powering the memory

---------28:57----------
so your RAM is probably turning off of

---------28:58----------
intermittently and that's what's causing

---------28:59----------
your beeping why don't the Apple Store

---------29:04----------
fix this

---------29:07----------
why well they could have been fixed that

---------29:09----------
they could have just replace my whole

---------29:10----------
boiler I guess that's a replacement

---------29:19----------
pinching Anna by Lewis is on Mac would

---------29:21----------
you go to hell and you die Oscar Alan

---------29:26----------
all right we're not gonna have to

---------29:28----------
replace much here we just got to get rid

---------29:29----------
of this bloated stuff and I'm wondering

---------29:33----------
where hi-hi is so how many of these Pro

---------29:37----------
points can be revived and how many of

---------29:38----------
them have gone oh don't touch that don't

---------29:42----------
touch it don't touch that you grab that

---------29:45----------
by the wrong end very bad things will

---------29:47----------
happen to you

---------29:56----------
and the lighting is terrible you can

---------29:58----------
barely see me what is that

---------30:04----------
why does HEIs laptop say helped me

---------30:08----------
[Music]

---------30:12----------
nobody help me can I can I kind of alter

---------30:15----------
that and write don't help me on there

---------30:16----------
maybe you don't notice right

---------30:18----------
I'm just alright don't help me thank you

---------30:21----------
busy but there's no pen here I don't

---------30:25----------
want to scrape away but it's probably a

---------30:26----------
vulnerable pad so I'm barely scraping

---------30:29----------
and just kind of hovering the soldering

---------30:31----------
iron over there's a lot of flux there

---------30:36----------
which is going to be helpful

---------30:38----------
none of that Paul amount of flux

---------30:44----------
[Music]

---------30:53----------
there we go see that's what I'm looking

---------30:54----------
for I want the corrosion to get sucked

---------30:57----------
up into the solder blob I don't want to

---------30:58----------
solder over corrosion but I don't want

---------31:00----------
to scrape hard enough that I break the

---------31:02----------
pro point it's gonna be attaching those

---------31:03----------
two pieces

---------31:06----------
[Music]

---------31:08----------
so one of the pieces of corrosion was on

---------31:11----------
the right so these two this pro point

---------31:15----------
actually is allowed to be corroded

---------31:16----------
because those two points is supposed to

---------31:17----------
be attached to one another so I can just

---------31:19----------
put a solder blob over there and that'll

---------31:21----------
do the job maybe up with a wire not

---------31:28----------
gonna be that lazy

---------31:32----------
wire between these two points will do

---------31:35----------
since those two legs of the chip are

---------31:36----------
actually supposed to be shorted together

---------31:37----------
ins

---------31:46----------
one two three four five six seven bottom

---------31:51----------
so now we should have two less of that

---------31:54----------
random crashing some memory errors we do

---------31:59----------
those that pro point this pro point

---------32:01----------
that's nasty I don't have to care about

---------32:02----------
because I just used to buy a wire to

---------32:03----------
bypass it this is the last one we're

---------32:06----------
gonna see what this conditioner that

---------32:07----------
probe is with a mild scraping

---------32:13----------
[Music]

---------32:35----------
some random corrosion up there some

---------32:39----------
decoupling caps I imagine for the CPU in

---------32:42----------
PCH me for circuits

---------33:00----------
[Music]

---------33:02----------
Eric it looks like mikta was made it to

---------33:04----------
my church you know erica is actually one

---------33:06----------
of the most is more McDowell than me and

---------33:08----------
she's a female which actually I actually

---------33:10----------
watch her I'm not gonna say what the

---------33:12----------
name is but I actually do watch off a

---------33:14----------
number of mgtow videos she is way more

---------33:17----------
McDowell than any men that I've ever met

---------33:19----------
which is odd because of the whole yeah I

---------33:22----------
make sure he doesn't know about the wall

---------33:24----------
I'm familiar with the wall

---------33:32----------
hey you actually uses a think pad hey

---------33:40----------
you oh you mean the other wall I thought

---------33:42----------
you meant my favorite album from the 70s

---------33:50----------
and all these are the connections we

---------33:51----------
redo

---------33:54----------
[Music]

---------34:08----------
[Music]

---------34:18----------
anyway for Erica to do this repair

---------34:21----------
stream with an L

---------34:22----------
I much prefer him to Lois go do

---------34:24----------
paperwork or something I'm not trusting

---------34:28----------
my laptop to that before

---------34:34----------
[Music]

---------34:35----------
but customer laptops get the energy

---------34:37----------
actually do you think an L could handle

---------34:39----------
it from here

---------34:40----------
do you think so do you think that'll be

---------34:44----------
an interesting stream

---------34:46----------
do you hear myself

---------34:48----------
do you hear my silence a little bit of

---------34:52----------
green stuff over there I should I should

---------34:55----------
be more committed to buy Apple products

---------34:57----------
now right

---------34:59----------
[Laughter]

---------35:09----------
[Laughter]

---------35:14----------
[Music]

---------35:16----------
all those little green points those are

---------35:18----------
gonna corrode later and again this is

---------35:20----------
gonna go through an ultrasonic cleaning

---------35:21----------
but I want to make sure that when it

---------35:22----------
does go through that ultrasonic cleaning

---------35:24----------
that those don't want the the probe

---------35:26----------
points don't wind up falling off with

---------35:28----------
the dirt that's a big issue you know

---------35:30----------
it's a very common question and I get it

---------35:32----------
all the time and I should probably do a

---------35:33----------
video on it which is why am i cleaning

---------35:36----------
why am I not cleaning the board before

---------35:38----------
working on it it's because I want to see

---------35:40----------
all these things because I don't want

---------35:41----------
that little pro point to come off in the

---------35:42----------
ultrasonic cleaner I mean or not know

---------35:44----------
where it is

---------35:45----------
ok-hee Blair wants you to fix this board

---------35:49----------
instead of me you want somebody with

---------35:53----------
handsome Staten Island charm what do you

---------35:56----------
guys like that Midway I already didn't

---------36:03----------
know there's a no backlight part do you

---------36:04----------
want to go over the randomly crashing

---------36:06----------
part on an air in 2012 and I have no

---------36:19----------
idea I know the person who asked how's

---------36:21----------
it going John

---------36:25----------
[Music]

---------36:34----------
rather that the time

---------36:38----------
[Music]

---------36:41----------
okay now well we're gonna put this to

---------36:46----------
the ultrasonic later but for now I'd

---------36:48----------
like to see if this gets you a backlight

---------36:49----------
and also a Wi-Fi oh I almost forgot

---------37:08----------
I almost forgot

---------37:18----------
do you want your machine to have a jtag

---------37:20----------
connector on America if it doesn't need

---------37:22----------
one you can take it off hook into the

---------37:24----------
side of microphone okay if it doesn't

---------37:26----------
need one you can take it off but if it's

---------37:28----------
needed you can take it off

---------37:33----------
die die yes

---------37:37----------
[Music]

---------37:40----------
that's gonna say

---------37:44----------
Wow going off

---------37:51----------
[Music]

---------38:02----------
there's a Paul Daniels in my chat how's

---------38:05----------
it going Paul Daniels

---------38:06----------
[Music]

---------38:12----------
okay oh yeah I can't believe I almost

---------38:16----------
missed an opportunity to remove an

---------38:17----------
innocent little jtag connector

---------38:23----------
someone said selling that GTI got a

---------38:25----------
premium on the store and it went on the

---------38:30----------
ground randomly crashing kernel panic

---------38:35----------
and people have realized so apparently

---------38:41----------
that apparently the water tends to trend

---------38:45----------
towards the mem vtt enable circuit which

---------38:47----------
is why I could be randomly Colonel

---------38:49----------
randomly beeping because if it would

---------38:51----------
stop powering the memory your pods yet

---------38:53----------
then it would look at the excellent

---------38:55----------
lighting right we have call well trust

---------39:00----------
me that was my that was my first

---------39:01----------
instinct actually I don't even go to KFC

---------39:04----------
myself I should have had the chat to a

---------39:07----------
vote what's that [ __ ] is this Erica what

---------39:09----------
really what what is this can you tell

---------39:12----------
everybody what this is oh so this is

---------39:14----------
okay so I tried to replace my Wi-Fi card

---------39:16----------
myself I replaced my wife I caught

---------39:21----------
myself and it still didn't work so I got

---------39:23----------
this little USB Wi-Fi dongle and a

---------39:25----------
plastic part the plastic part doesn't

---------39:31----------
work anymore for sure rip it's served me

---------39:35----------
very well and yeah now it definitely

---------39:37----------
doesn't fit in but it was a very handy

---------39:41----------
USB Wi-Fi dongle yes

---------39:47----------
see it it goes in that way and I had

---------39:51----------
this little plastic part but it broke

---------39:52----------
off yeah I had to use a dongle my

---------39:57----------
computer

---------40:02----------
I I think it is yeah it's at a max or

---------40:05----------
something like that

---------40:17----------
right screw right halt

---------40:24----------
I'm at uncle's watch you know we still

---------40:27----------
haven't we're still watching haven't

---------40:30----------
we've made a halfway through Erica stop

---------40:33----------
I'm at all gonna post spoilers it's too

---------40:35----------
late what you think you can't look at

---------40:39----------
chatter we have to [ __ ] hex this one

---------40:41----------
yeah I know I I don't think are you

---------40:45----------
kidding me even if they ruin it we'll

---------40:46----------
just ban them forever I guess that

---------40:48----------
doesn't matter but then it'll still be

---------40:50----------
spoiled I can't believe I'm screwing

---------40:52----------
this together before I test it that's

---------40:54----------
breaking some of the most basic rules

---------40:58----------
okay let's just make sure backlight is

---------41:00----------
no longer shorted so I don't blow a fuse

---------41:11----------
that's the decent number so we have that

---------41:15----------
together see if you turn on or if you

---------41:20----------
beep wonder if the battery's dead

---------41:27----------
okay how many apps do you take let's see

---------41:42----------
unplug battery you take a hundred 80

---------41:46----------
milliamps and don't hate it she like

---------41:47----------
burritos a lot oh here we go thanks that

---------41:53----------
would be great if I killed your MacBook

---------41:54----------
on stream you'd never believe me if I

---------41:57----------
said it was X let's try that again

---------42:23----------
Eric I'm gonna trash this piece of [ __ ]

---------42:25----------
okay see if you get a light on the

---------42:26----------
screen at least we're getting a

---------42:28----------
backlight no no it was beautiful

---------42:32----------
I thought I had fixed the beeping and

---------42:34----------
why is the donation not showing up who

---------42:37----------
manages these okay YouTube live alerts I

---------42:45----------
don't know what that was what did I just

---------42:47----------
get a donation I'm very sorry if that

---------42:50----------
showed up Erica it's too late it's okay

---------42:57----------
alright sign in wait let's just change

---------42:59----------
this so that they can't see what it ever

---------43:01----------
is your typing sorry Paul that's a door

---------43:07----------
alright login let's see if you have

---------43:08----------
Wi-Fi see if we can connect the Wi-Fi

---------43:10----------
that's it's the resolution of our

---------43:12----------
external monitor which you use it on

---------43:14----------
external because it's an Apple product

---------43:17----------
and it's dumb and it doesn't know to

---------43:18----------
change the resolution and itself alright

---------43:21----------
so let's see if it sees oh my god what

---------43:25----------
is this desktop Erica your desktop has

---------43:33----------
how many

---------43:34----------
that is way too many icons all right so

---------43:37----------
1440 by 990 whoops I click the wrong one

---------43:40----------
1440 by 900 ok that's good so we have a

---------43:43----------
backlight now let's see if we see Y sine

---------43:45----------
arcs so see it sees Wi-Fi networks and

---------43:54----------
it is a backlight so congratulations

---------43:56----------
you've been working laptop but it's a

---------44:00----------
Mac what it's Erica - Mac we got to get

---------44:02----------
rid of this thing no Paul weighs them

---------44:06----------
okay all right one two can I say rip

---------44:18----------
that Apple right how else am I supposed

---------44:21----------
to communicate with you

---------44:23----------
we only communication I know

---------44:32----------
here's some money to valet the buffet on

---------44:35----------
a nice restaurant valet parking for a

---------44:37----------
birthing oh I wonder oh by the way just

---------44:41----------
