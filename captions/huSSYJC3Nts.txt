bp3 before - is 3.4 PP bus is 12.5 but

---------00:06----------
there's no green light hmm oh yeah 3.42

---------00:13----------
1 PP 3 V 4 - 12 point 56 on PP bus but

---------00:18----------
no green light

---------00:19----------
well what's responsible for creating the

---------00:21----------
green light in this MacBook what's gonna

---------00:23----------
allow you to have a green light is going

---------00:25----------
to be when the charger which plugs in

---------00:28----------
over here gets to talk to the system

---------00:31----------
management controller which is this

---------00:35----------
thingy over here see SMC it's just a

---------00:42----------
management controller when it gets to

---------00:45----------
talk to this on the SIS 1 wire line so

---------00:49----------
the SIS 1 wire line sits between you

---------00:52----------
7000 and the charger so the charger is

---------00:57----------
here Chargers adapter sends line goes to

---------01:00----------
this chip from this chip to the system

---------01:02----------
management controller let's see what

---------01:04----------
that looks like on our motherboard what

---------01:06----------
is this foreign substance

---------01:14----------
DK fires guys sounds like somebody who

---------01:17----------
needs to program his own apps

---------01:44----------
so as can be seen here this is the pin

---------01:49----------
that is the problem the pp three before

---------01:52----------
to pin now this logic eight over here is

---------01:55----------
when sm c bc AC okay is present this

---------01:58----------
logic gate is going to take p p3 before

---------02:00----------
two and pass it through to use seven

---------02:02----------
thousand use seven thousand is the chip

---------02:04----------
that's going to allow the chargers

---------02:06----------
adapter sense line which was responsible

---------02:08----------
for sensing the charger and turning on

---------02:09----------
the green light and allowing it to work

---------02:10----------
to talk to the system management

---------02:12----------
controller which is on the system own

---------02:13----------
wire line and as can be seen here the PP

---------02:17----------
34 to pad is totally done for there's

---------02:20----------
actually an indent in there so as I'm

---------02:22----------
moving my tweezers along you can't

---------02:25----------
really feel this but it slides in see

---------02:29----------
it's a crevice so there's no pad there's

---------02:32----------
I'm gonna have to run a little wire so

---------02:34----------
we're gonna run a little jumper wire

---------02:36----------
after we just restore this and then this

---------02:39----------
board is going to work right again

---------02:47----------
you

---------03:15----------
all right now we can grab our P P 3 V 4

---------03:19----------
2 from this capacitor right down here as

---------03:21----------
can be seen on the schematic and board

---------03:22----------
view see BP 3 before - a missing pad ok

---------03:27----------
right of this capacitor thank Paul

---------03:30----------
Daniels for coding Plex board view which

---------03:32----------
makes it easy to see where these things

---------03:33----------
are coming from

---------04:04----------
can you buy those parts new hey you can

---------04:08----------
this doesn't feel very often

---------04:10----------
[Applause]

---------04:29----------
after this we're gonna run a little

---------04:31----------
jumper wire it's gonna turn the board

---------04:33----------
around anytime you're working on the

---------04:35----------
stuff make sure that you always turn the

---------04:36----------
board around so that you're comfortable

---------04:38----------
the board does not have to be

---------04:39----------
comfortable you need to be comfortable

---------04:42----------
then we're gonna run the little jumper

---------04:44----------
wire we're pp3 before two has to be

---------04:48----------
though your plans for going to Norway

---------04:50----------
if what I heard is true which is that

---------04:52----------
I'm not allowed to record in the

---------04:54----------
courtroom then I won't have a plan to go

---------04:55----------
to Norway because there won't be

---------04:56----------
anything for me to do waiting to see if

---------04:59----------
that was correct or not why are cats so

---------05:03----------
cute well it's the way that they trick

---------05:06----------
humans and not realizing that they're

---------05:08----------
serial killers

---------05:09----------
which they are

---------05:18----------
cats are evil serial killers but they're

---------05:20----------
cute so we let them get away with murder

---------05:34----------
which is fine if you apply it to kitty

---------05:36----------
cats not if you apply it to your dating

---------05:38----------
life lesson learned

---------05:50----------
alright watch this thing have a nice

---------05:53----------
green light on the charger now MacBook

---------05:57----------
this is a workingman book now the reason

---------06:01----------
that I went straight for the one wire

---------06:02----------
circuit rather than check the SMC is

---------06:04----------
because pp buss g3 hot which 12 point 56

---------06:07----------
volts the SMC is going to communicate

---------06:10----------
with the chip that makes pp bus g3 hot

---------06:12----------
on an SMC data line so if you look over

---------06:15----------
here you'll see that the SMC

---------06:18----------
communicates with the battery charger

---------06:21----------
chip and the battery charging chip here

---------06:23----------
is the chip that creates a rail called

---------06:25----------
pp bus g3 huh when the SMC is

---------06:28----------
communicating with this chip it'll make

---------06:31----------
12 point 56 volts or eight point 56

---------06:34----------
volts on an air when the SMC is not

---------06:36----------
properly communicating with this chip

---------06:38----------
it'll produce 12 point 23 volts or eight

---------06:41----------
point 16 volts on an air and here's the

---------06:43----------
data line Rick the communication occurs

---------06:45----------
since that communication was occurring I

---------06:47----------
assumed that the SMC was likely good and

---------06:49----------
was turning on and at the issue had to

---------06:51----------
be somewhere else which is why when we

---------06:53----------
checked this area we checked that area

---------06:55----------
we saw the corrosion and so on and so

---------06:58----------
forth so this here this little logic

---------07:01----------
gate is gonna work and you can look it

---------07:03----------
up there's a little truth table in the

---------07:04----------
manual so if you look at the pins in a

---------07:08----------
in be VCC out Y now if we look at the

---------07:16----------
truth table down here when a and B are

---------07:20----------
both low output is low when a is low and

---------07:23----------
B is high output is low when a is high

---------07:26----------
and B is low output is low when a and B

---------07:28----------
are both high then output is hot so the

---------07:31----------
way this little logic gate is going to

---------07:33----------
work is when it's only going to allow

---------07:36----------
power to pass through when one and two

---------07:39----------
which are both tied together here as you

---------07:41----------
can see when SMC bc AC okay is high it

---------07:44----------
will let 3.42 volts pass to its output

---------07:47----------
and turn this on now that we've gone

---------07:49----------
over that we can turn this on and see

---------07:51----------
that it has a nice green light and then

---------07:53----------
it charges as you can see we have a

---------07:55----------
green light and as you can see the fan

---------07:58----------
is spinning this beautiful board that

---------08:01----------
was picked a hundred ten percent

---------08:03----------
at random just so happens to have been a

---------08:07----------
simple easy repair that only needed a

---------08:10----------
logic gate and a little jumper wire or

---------08:12----------
pp3 before - which is the VCC and pin to

---------08:15----------
you 7001 which is the power pin that's

---------08:17----------
gonna turn it on see here this is my

---------08:19----------
microscope right this is the power

---------08:21----------
supply to a microscope this here is the

---------08:23----------
VCC pin of my microscope that pen
