---------00:36----------
what a cute little kitty cat that's our

---------00:43----------
Mouse hunter everybody say hi to store

---------00:47----------
night security so when I put together

---------00:50----------
that document which was a budget for the

---------00:52----------
new store one of the things I said is if

---------00:54----------
there's a budget shortfall that Oreo or

---------00:56----------
serve as security rather than having an

---------00:58----------
alarm so I figured we would get started

---------01:00----------
training Oreo but first having him kill

---------01:03----------
the mice here the new store has way more

---------01:05----------
mice than this one does this one just

---------01:07----------
started to get a mouse problem a few

---------01:08----------
days ago but I don't think we're gonna

---------01:10----------
have a mouse problem anymore

---------01:11----------
something tells me that we're not gonna

---------01:13----------
have a mouse problem at 186 First Avenue

---------01:14----------
anymore very soon but he's gonna be

---------01:17----------
training here and then once he's done

---------01:19----------
training he's gonna have to take on all

---------01:20----------
the mice at 141 West 27th which has a

---------01:23----------
serious Mouse problem that's a new store

---------01:25----------
and since we had a budget shortfall and

---------01:27----------
arranging for the new store we were also

---------01:28----------
gonna be training him to be the security

---------01:30----------
alarm

---------01:31----------
so one thing many of you may not know

---------01:32----------
about Oreo at home if I use remote

---------01:36----------
desktop to remote into my home computer

---------01:38----------
the moment my pressure on the screen

---------01:39----------
starts moving he runs over to the couch

---------01:42----------
and stares at that cursor and he meows

---------01:44----------
every time it moves and he stays there

---------01:46----------
until I log out once I log out in the

---------01:48----------
monitor turns off he'll go back to doing

---------01:50----------
what he's doing but Erica tells me for

---------01:51----------
the entire time that I am remoted into

---------01:56----------
my home computer he stares at the screen

---------01:58----------
intently and he stares at that cursor he

---------02:00----------
is an excellent security kitten

---------02:01----------
something tells me Paul is not gonna be

---------02:03----------
able to get a lot of work done today

---------02:05----------
yeah my productivity is gonna go down a

---------02:08----------
little today

---------02:09----------
thank you come off my lab work with them

---------02:13----------
on purpose in here and now he's not no

---------02:15----------
longer work with them on your lab I have

---------02:17----------
to go get a computer a 1466 no power you

---------02:22----------
would kick order you off your lab for an

---------02:24----------
era no power

---------02:27----------
not the first day he's here

---------02:31----------
well we needed an additional $50,000

---------02:36----------
Paul you have a turtle at home

---------02:43----------
Paul has tried to work with Oreo on his

---------02:46----------
lap this is gonna be good

---------02:47----------
there good kitty look good boy it's good

---------02:50----------
boy there's a good little esd-safe kitty

---------02:53----------
here's my esd-safe kitty

---------02:59----------
let's cut open the pp3 before to

---------03:02----------
underscore g3 hot circuit and get to

---------03:04----------
work

---------03:12----------
let's cut that pp3 before to up these

---------03:16----------
we're not getting a green light

---------03:47----------
all right so let's take a look at how

---------03:49----------
the people through four to underscore g3

---------03:51----------
hot circuit operates on here now as many

---------03:53----------
of you know if you watch money in my

---------03:54----------
first 600 to 1,000 border pair videos

---------03:57----------
you need the one wire circuit to work in

---------03:59----------
order to get a green light and the one

---------04:00----------
wire circuit is powered by paper through

---------04:02----------
the four to underscore g3 high so this

---------04:04----------
is the page for people three or four to

---------04:05----------
underscore g3 how it's gonna be created

---------04:07----------
and why are you showing this crap for my

---------04:10----------
architect on the screen go away go away

---------04:15----------
so over here you've got the voltage that

---------04:18----------
goes into the chip that makes people

---------04:20----------
three or four to underscore g3 hot and

---------04:21----------
that wasn't present at zero now that's

---------04:23----------
gonna come from either the battery of

---------04:25----------
the charger battery or charger now that

---------04:29----------
for the charger power to go through this

---------04:31----------
transistors got open this is an N this

---------04:33----------
is a p-channel MOSFET which means it's

---------04:34----------
gonna open when the voltage in the gate

---------04:35----------
is lower than the voltage on the source

---------04:38----------
so you have here a voltage divider

---------04:41----------
between the gate and ground it's kind of

---------04:48----------
formed by this diode in this resistor

---------04:49----------
but this diode doesn't work then this is

---------04:52----------
always gonna have the 18 volts of the

---------04:55----------
source present on its gate because it's

---------04:57----------
not gonna be path to ground to lower and

---------04:59----------
then it's never gonna work so I'm kind

---------05:00----------
of wondering if there was a little

---------05:01----------
corrosion under there something manage

---------05:03----------
to make its way under that under filled

---------05:04----------
area and if that's why we're not getting

---------05:07----------
anything on on input so let's take a

---------05:11----------
look at each each individual part of

---------05:13----------
this so if we go to the PDF first things

---------05:16----------
first and just essentially switch it

---------05:18----------
over so it's easier for me to use let's

---------05:21----------
go to Q 7010 I want to see what's

---------05:24----------
present on the source so that's gonna be

---------05:28----------
pin 1 of C 7 T 12 right here the mouse

---------05:32----------
doesn't show up in the right area

---------05:33----------
because of Paul Daniels software but we

---------05:35----------
should be used to bug like that right

---------05:37----------
now the mouse shows up in a different

---------05:38----------
area in the soft way that it does in the

---------05:40----------
screen that is just the Paul Daniels ISM

---------05:44----------
so you have 17 on there and then we look

---------05:47----------
on the gate

---------05:49----------
and we have 17 on the game so that means

---------05:51----------
that this diode is not doing its job

---------05:53----------
this diode is probably broken the diode

---------05:56----------
see if you look on the schematic number

---------06:00----------
it for an end channel to open the

---------06:01----------
voltage in the source has to be higher

---------06:04----------
than what's in the gate it's on the gate

---------06:05----------
needs to be lower than the source so

---------06:07----------
what our 7010 does in r7 the 11 is it

---------06:10----------
takes the voltage from the source and

---------06:11----------
places it on the gate now in order for

---------06:15----------
the voltage in the gate to go down we

---------06:16----------
have to take some voltage from the gate

---------06:18----------
and send it to ground which is what the

---------06:20----------
diode is supposed to be doing but it's

---------06:21----------
not because it's you know that little

---------06:24----------
diode over there that looks so cute like

---------06:27----------
an adorable little kitten it's not

---------06:30----------
working so we're gonna replace this

---------06:32----------
diode with a superior diode

---------06:42----------
we're going to heat it up cut it off the

---------06:45----------
board your that vote now that diode is

---------06:49----------
gonna act as the bottom of a voltage

---------06:51----------
divider so a voltage divider is

---------06:53----------
essentially two are usually just two

---------06:55----------
resistors one resistor between high

---------06:57----------
voltage and where you want the middle

---------06:58----------
voltage to go and then another resistor

---------07:01----------
between we want them the middle voltage

---------07:03----------
to go and then ground so let's see it's

---------07:04----------
a very inefficient but super cheap way

---------07:08----------
of lowering voltage in an area obviously

---------07:12----------
you wouldn't use this as apply large

---------07:13----------
amounts of current because it's

---------07:15----------
ridiculously inefficient as its linear

---------07:17----------
it is on all the time

---------07:18----------
I bought this divider could technically

---------07:21----------
be called a linear power supply

---------07:23----------
you know while accurate it's

---------07:25----------
ridiculously inefficient as opposed to a

---------07:29----------
switching power supply now if you look

---------07:32----------
really closely you'll see that the diode

---------07:35----------
is an apple diode how can you tell well

---------07:39----------
it's laughing at the user see that what

---------07:42----------
does it say on it and no that does not

---------07:45----------
stand for hydrogen audio org if you look

---------07:47----------
really closely you can make out that the

---------07:51----------
diode says ha let's see if I can get the

---------07:58----------
on screen

---------08:08----------
ha

---------08:10----------
the diode is laughing at you the

---------08:12----------
customer for buying this damn product

---------08:14----------
that has no liquid resistance unlike IBM

---------08:18----------
laptops from as far as 15 years ago the

---------08:24----------
laptop is laughing at you now I've made

---------08:27----------
let's see if we are able to get a fan

---------08:29----------
spin in this beautiful MacBook now that

---------08:32----------
we have touched up the 5 volt in 3 volt

---------08:36----------
power supply by you 7501 and have fixed

---------08:42----------
the issue with intermittent pp3 before -

---------08:45----------
so even though this turned on in the

---------08:46----------
beginning of the stream you saw it

---------08:47----------
stopped turning on for me and how there

---------08:49----------
was a lot of liquid in those areas so

---------08:51----------
now when I do this I expected to be a

---------08:52----------
green light and also a fan spin with

---------08:55----------
proper milliamp usage and that it is

---------08:57----------
working beautiful so we had several

---------09:00----------
problems with this the first issue that

---------09:01----------
we had was generalised corrosion there

---------09:03----------
was generalised corrosion that needed to

---------09:05----------
be addressed and fixed in the pp3 before

---------09:08----------
to area we noticed that there was no

---------09:10----------
green line in the charger now remember

---------09:11----------
to get a green light in the charger to

---------09:13----------
get a green light the one wire circuit

---------09:15----------
has to work that's the circuit that

---------09:16----------
allows the charger to speak to the

---------09:17----------
system management controller and in

---------09:19----------
order for the system management

---------09:20----------
controller and the one wire circuit to

---------09:21----------
power these are two rails that are

---------09:23----------
powered by PP 3v for 200 squared G 3 huh

---------09:27----------
if PP 3 before 2 1 2 squared G 3 count

---------09:29----------
is not present those power where

---------09:30----------
although those chips are not going to

---------09:32----------
work pp 3 4 2 is not present because we

---------09:34----------
were missing 17 volts on its input pin

---------09:38----------
and if you take a look over here this is

---------09:42----------
the input 17 volts on VN it wasn't

---------09:45----------
present here it wasn't present here

---------09:48----------
it wasn't present here it wasn't present

---------09:51----------
here it was present here so it means the

---------09:53----------
transistor is not opening now either

---------09:55----------
a it's not being told to open or be it

---------09:57----------
is broken now first thing we got to do

---------10:01----------
before we just replace this because the

---------10:02----------
power is here but not here it must

---------10:03----------
replace this no we think engage brains

---------10:07----------
this is AP channel MOSFET meaning the

---------10:11----------
voltage and the gate G needs to be low

---------10:13----------
in the voltage in the source s we had 17

---------10:15----------
volts here and 17 volts here so

---------10:17----------
obviously there was a problem with it

---------10:20----------
being told to open now this is the path

---------10:23----------
to lower the voltage in the

---------10:24----------
the first thing I look for is clearly

---------10:25----------
this thing has to open the gate has to

---------10:27----------
be lower in the source so there must be

---------10:29----------
a path that they designed in here to get

---------10:31----------
the voltage in the gate to be lower than

---------10:32----------
the source so we take a look through

---------10:34----------
here and you see that the voltage on the

---------10:37----------
gate the only path that has to go down

---------10:39----------
to ground because ground is going to be

---------10:40----------
zero in this case is d70 12 so we're

---------10:44----------
that's the that's either that or r70 11

---------10:47----------
and r70 11 is not going to be it it's

---------10:49----------
this intermediate path to ground

---------10:50----------
it's the diode we replaced the diode and

---------10:52----------
it works the diode is one of those

---------10:54----------
little glassy looking diodes a lot of

---------10:55----------
those glassy looking diodes the problems

---------10:57----------
with them as well as the glassy looking

---------10:59----------
transistors is that they're really easy

---------11:01----------
to break and that is evident here

---------11:04----------
because it didn't even look broken but

---------11:06----------
it was and it's gonna trick you because

---------11:08----------
even though that didn't have corrosion

---------11:10----------
on it it broke notice how the components

---------11:12----------
that actually did have corrosion on them

---------11:13----------
by the PP 30 before 2 circuit were

---------11:15----------
easily salvageable whereas the diode

---------11:17----------
that was right under all of that

---------11:20----------
encapsulation was a thing that wasn't

---------11:22----------
working that's a trick that apples gonna

---------11:24----------
play on you which is why the diode says

---------11:26----------
ha on it because Apple is laughing at

---------11:29----------
you if you bought this product that's it

---------11:30----------
for today and as always I hope you

---------11:32----------
learned something thank you so much for

---------11:33----------
watching thank you so much for being a

---------11:35----------
part of what we do here I hope you

---------11:36----------
learned something I hope you're able to

---------11:37----------
take this stuff and use it to fix a

---------11:38----------
product make some money for yourself

---------11:39----------
make somebody happy and I'll see you in

---------11:41----------
