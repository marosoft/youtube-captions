---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm going to be going over a

---------00:01----------
board that has an issue where it doesn't

---------00:03----------
power on so this is the board right over

---------00:05----------
here and when I plug my charger in I get

---------00:10----------
no green light on my adapter but also it

---------00:15----------
doesn't turn on at all now sometimes

---------00:17----------
there's an issue with the charging

---------00:19----------
circuit where it won't turn on but if

---------00:20----------
you plug in so one of the first things

---------00:28----------
I'm going to do is start measuring

---------00:29----------
around main power rails now on these

---------00:32----------
schematics that you get which you can

---------00:35----------
find if you know how to use Google and

---------00:36----------
have a brain and on the first page

---------00:40----------
usually there are a list of main power

---------00:42----------
rails so this is pretty much what you

---------00:44----------
need in order for the computer to turn

---------00:46----------
on so I'm just going to scroll down to

---------00:48----------
that over here because a lot of this

---------00:49----------
admittedly is confusing if you've you

---------00:51----------
never seen it for the first time and I

---------00:53----------
want to try to make it seem a little bit

---------00:56----------
more simple so you go you know a desktop

---------00:59----------
computer as a 12 volt rail a 5 volt rail

---------01:02----------
a 3 volt rail and you have it on the you

---------01:04----------
know the yellow the red and the orange

---------01:05----------
wires well a laptop has the same general

---------01:09----------
principle so when you're using a laptop

---------01:11----------
to turn the brightness down here so it

---------01:13----------
doesn't screw with the camera too much

---------01:14----------
when you have a laptop you have the same

---------01:16----------
general idea so you have a charger that

---------01:18----------
brings 18 volts or 20 volts or 16 volts

---------01:21----------
to the laptop but at the same time you

---------01:23----------
have all these other power rails that

---------01:24----------
are created so that the machine can

---------01:26----------
actually work so for example I just

---------01:29----------
assume in so this is actually visible to

---------01:31----------
you so over here you have pp bus g3 hot

---------01:37----------
and it tells you this is supposed to be

---------01:39----------
twelve point eight volts now zoom in a

---------01:43----------
little more then over here you have pp

---------01:47----------
bus underscore s v underscore HS

---------01:49----------
underscore computing underscore I sense

---------01:50----------
twelve point eight volts P PDCA and

---------01:53----------
underscore g3 odd 18 point 5 volts PP 3

---------01:56----------
v 4 to order square G 3.3 point 42 volts

---------01:59----------
and so on and so forth and then you have

---------02:01----------
other rails that are dependent on

---------02:03----------
specific power states at the computer so

---------02:05----------
PP 5vs5 this is a rail that's supposed

---------02:07----------
to be present when the computer is in S

---------02:09----------
5 state or turned off PP 5 es 3 this is

---------02:12----------
a

---------02:13----------
real that's supposed to be present when

---------02:14----------
the computer sleeping pp5 VSO this is a

---------02:17----------
rail that's supposed to be present when

---------02:18----------
the computer is on so you can read up on

---------02:20----------
what different the different power

---------02:21----------
states of the computer are so for

---------02:23----------
example you have your computer on and

---------02:26----------
it's open and it's running that's a so

---------02:29----------
you close it and you see the little LED

---------02:32----------
light blinking on the lid as it's

---------02:34----------
sleeping that says three you have the

---------02:35----------
computer off that says five and I may be

---------02:38----------
up I wanted to with the numbers on -

---------02:39----------
it's on so the early and I haven't had

---------02:41----------
breakfast yet but I'm not really much of

---------02:43----------
a morning person but the point is you

---------02:45----------
have these different all these different

---------02:46----------
power rails and after a while you'll

---------02:48----------
just kind of get the hang of which one

---------02:50----------
you should be measuring immediately for

---------02:51----------
example I don't care about t29 right now

---------02:54----------
for it's like if you look through the

---------02:55----------
circuit you'll see that these rails are

---------02:57----------
actually four DisplayPort now I don't

---------03:00----------
watch for example I'll just search and

---------03:02----------
you'll see where it shows up in the

---------03:03----------
schematic with is where this is and in

---------03:06----------
the beginning of what I'm doing again I

---------03:08----------
don't care about DisplayPort I mean I

---------03:10----------
have a computer that doesn't actually

---------03:11----------
work so why would DisplayPort matter to

---------03:13----------
me speaking of a computer that doesn't

---------03:15----------
actually work notice how slow it is even

---------03:17----------
with a six core i three point three

---------03:19----------
guards as well i seven and an SSD to

---------03:23----------
search through a PDF i/o this is why I

---------03:25----------
just I why I can't stand PDFs so this

---------03:27----------
over here is at each one for example

---------03:31----------
this is why this is a power rail that I

---------03:32----------
want to check so this is for a boost

---------03:35----------
regulator that pretty much powers

---------03:37----------
circuitry for DisplayPort so again why

---------03:40----------
would I care about DisplayPort well my

---------03:42----------
computer doesn't even turn on so one of

---------03:44----------
the first things that I'm going to do

---------03:45----------
here is I'm going to go through and

---------03:46----------
check some of the basic rails and again

---------03:49----------
you may ask me well how do you know

---------03:50----------
where to find them again board view

---------03:52----------
schematic where do you find board view

---------03:54----------
and schematic Google and if at this

---------03:56----------
point you ask me how to use Google I am

---------03:58----------
this is this is pretty much where I say

---------03:59----------
if you don't know how to use Google you

---------04:00----------
probably should not be trying to fix

---------04:02----------
motherboards because you're going to

---------04:03----------
fail terribly so I'm going to measure

---------04:07----------
around and see if my rails are present

---------04:08----------
so the first one I measure is PP bus g3

---------04:11----------
hot because that is the main rail that's

---------04:12----------
going to be creating a lot of the others

---------04:13----------
so if you don't have that one you don't

---------04:16----------
have anything else because that 12 volt

---------04:18----------
rail is responsible for many other rails

---------04:20----------
in the machine some rails like pp 3 v 4

---------04:22----------
2 are independent of P P bus g3 output

---------04:25----------
PP bus g3 others respond

---------04:27----------
for a lot of others so if you don't have

---------04:28----------
that just get out so I have 12 points of

---------04:31----------
schematics is 12.8 I live with 12 points

---------04:34----------
up next one is pp 5v s3 also notice I'm

---------04:39----------
skipping directly ahead of s5 because if

---------04:41----------
s3 as good as 5 should be as well

---------04:43----------
imagine I got my five point one there

---------04:46----------
I'm happy pp 3 v3 as 5 let's see 3 point

---------04:51----------
4 PP 3 V 3 s 3 3 point 4 PP Bush g3 huh

---------04:57----------
oh not the pp 3 V 4 underscore g3 odd at

---------05:02----------
this point I'm fairly satisfied the

---------05:03----------
power rails at present and I'm ready to

---------05:05----------
start considering other issues in the

---------05:06----------
troubleshooting process so one of the

---------05:08----------
first issues that I want to troubleshoot

---------05:10----------
is why don't I have a green light I

---------05:11----------
should have a green light on this

---------05:12----------
machine I should have a green light

---------05:14----------
because you know my power rails are

---------05:17----------
present so if P P 3 V 4 2 or in present

---------05:19----------
which helps power the one wire circuit I

---------05:21----------
would understand why I don't have a

---------05:23----------
green light so let's go over one of the

---------05:25----------
circuits that I've talked about many

---------05:26----------
times so if this winds up being the only

---------05:28----------
problem with this board I'm actually

---------05:29----------
going to label it so that I can point to

---------05:31----------
it in other videos and stop pre

---------05:32----------
explaining it over and over and over

---------05:34----------
again because as you can imagine

---------05:35----------
explaining the same thing over and over

---------05:36----------
again can get old very very quickly so

---------05:39----------
let me just bring the camera up here and

---------05:40----------
we're going to start looking at the

---------05:42----------
first thing that I look at when I'm

---------05:43----------
having issues with the green light so

---------05:53----------
okay so first things first if you're not

---------05:56----------
getting a green light and the green

---------05:57----------
light comes from the charger first

---------05:59----------
didn't look at would be the charge right

---------06:01----------
common sensor so over here you have the

---------06:03----------
charger and there's this thing this line

---------06:05----------
called adapter sense right over here so

---------06:08----------
right over here it says adapter sense so

---------06:11----------
I would do with my brain as I would just

---------06:13----------
try to follow this along and try to see

---------06:15----------
where it goes so it goes to this

---------06:16----------
component called you 6900 and then it

---------06:22----------
shoots out something called sis one wire

---------06:23----------
now the reason I know that it's shooting

---------06:25----------
out says one wire is because right over

---------06:26----------
here in this little tag it says by at

---------06:29----------
the whole point is that this is a line

---------06:30----------
where data shoots out and data comes

---------06:34----------
back in it's a bi-directional

---------06:35----------
communication line so this over here is

---------06:38----------
going to send out a signal called sis

---------06:40----------
one wire now this also has an input of

---------06:43----------
SM CBC a coq VCC this comes from this

---------06:47----------
chip over here you 6901 this is a logic

---------06:50----------
gate so it pretty much if when SM CBC

---------06:53----------
Aycock comes in it allows this 3.42

---------06:56----------
volts from here to just go right through

---------06:58----------
to there and that's that's about that so

---------07:01----------
this is going to get a turn-on signal

---------07:03----------
this is going to get a signal on VCC pin

---------07:05----------
if SM CBC a is there let's see what

---------07:08----------
SMC underscore BC underscore ACOG

---------07:10----------
actually does by searching through the

---------07:12----------
schematic and then waiting for my PDF to

---------07:15----------
load in a very slow fashion it doesn't

---------07:18----------
matter how fast your computer's six core

---------07:20----------
i7 raid zero SSDs still takes time to

---------07:23----------
render a PDF file so this over

---------07:26----------
here is U 7,000 this is the chip that

---------07:28----------
I've explained in other videos which I'm

---------07:29----------
a link to here controls the charging

---------07:31----------
circuitry so up there we're talking

---------07:35----------
about how to get a green light in the

---------07:36----------
charger over here we're talking about

---------07:38----------
the charger producing voltage for the

---------07:40----------
machine so this is semi-related so the

---------07:42----------
way this works over here and if you are

---------07:44----------
asking how did I figure this out I

---------07:46----------
figured it out when I stupidly measured

---------07:48----------
around and realized just through

---------07:49----------
patterns that this does not shoot out

---------07:51----------
when charger a.cian is not there the

---------07:53----------
whole way this works is that the charger

---------07:55----------
is over here so you see from adapter PP

---------07:57----------
+ DC an undersquare g3 hot it goes down

---------08:00----------
to here after it goes down to there you

---------08:02----------
have this voltage divider of our 70 10

---------08:05----------
and our 70

---------08:06----------
Levin the whole point of a voltage

---------08:07----------
divider is to take a higher voltage and

---------08:09----------
turn it into a lower one so you have

---------08:11----------
that going to the charger AC pin when is

---------08:14----------
four volts on the charger AC and pin you

---------08:16----------
will see that three volts gets put out

---------08:18----------
on smc BCA so if this chip is

---------08:21----------
shooting at us MCB CA you go up

---------08:28----------
come on

---------08:30----------
alright if that chip is shooting at SMC

---------08:32----------
BCA it will go to this logic gate

---------08:34----------
this logic gate will take the PP 3 V 4

---------08:37----------
to underscore g3 hot voltage coming in

---------08:39----------
up here it will shoot it out over here

---------08:41----------
and the whole way this works is that if

---------08:44----------
it sees adapter sense coming over here

---------08:47----------
and it sees SMC BCA meaning it sees

---------08:50----------
that the charger is connected so adapter

---------08:52----------
sense is there if it sees the charger is

---------08:53----------
connected and it sees SMC BCA which

---------08:57----------
means that the charging chip is happy so

---------09:00----------
if the charging chip is happy and the

---------09:01----------
charger is connected it will tell the

---------09:03----------
system via sis one wire to turn on the

---------09:05----------
green light and if you see where it says

---------09:07----------
one wire goes this one wire goes to the

---------09:10----------
SMC which is the system management

---------09:12----------
controller which is what pretty much

---------09:14----------
controls this whole process so the first

---------09:16----------
things first let's see what does work

---------09:18----------
what doesn't work and what all the stuff

---------09:20----------
looks like so we're going to look for u

---------09:22----------
6901

---------09:23----------
on the board view so you look for u 6901

---------09:26----------
and the board view software says that

---------09:29----------
it's right over here

---------09:32----------
so I'm going to look on the edge of my

---------09:34----------
board no and I'm gonna won't be

---------09:36----------
interested in what this looks like

---------09:38----------
let's see if that is in that area ok

---------09:41----------
that is the area you could see I'm

---------09:43----------
looking in this little part of the LCD

---------09:45----------
they can't court a camera and you really

---------09:48----------
just can't see over there so when I

---------09:50----------
look over here let me show you what I

---------09:53----------
see so that looks like see that

---------10:00----------
that looks like complete not an utter

---------10:02----------
 so that is the component that

---------10:05----------
looks fried so first things first is

---------10:09----------
let's replace it and let's see what the

---------10:11----------
traces look like so the trace that

---------10:13----------
always gets burnt on these boards is

---------10:15----------
that pp 3 v 4 to underscore g3 hot raise

---------10:18----------
so

---------10:19----------
as I showed you in the schematic you

---------10:20----------
have PP 3 V 4 - once this logic gate

---------10:23----------
gets the signal it passes the PP 3 V 4 -

---------10:25----------
on to you 6900 once it passed once this

---------10:28----------
chip has those two signals so adapter

---------10:31----------
sense and it has 3 volts coming in on

---------10:33----------
VCC once it has those two things that

---------10:36----------
it's a happy camper it sends out

---------10:37----------
everything on sis 1 wire and it's all

---------10:39----------
the green light to turn on but if it

---------10:41----------
doesn't have those two signals it will

---------10:43----------
never turn on sis 1 wire and the board

---------10:45----------
will never have a green light on the

---------10:47----------
charger so let's start troubleshooting

---------10:49----------
that aspect to the circuit now first

---------10:51----------
things first before I even start

---------10:53----------
measuring around I can clearly see

---------10:54----------
something that's broken

---------10:55----------
so since I'm staring at something that's

---------10:56----------
broken right in the face before I even

---------10:58----------
bother measuring let's start fixing you

---------11:02----------
know because again all these little

---------11:03----------
parts here like that again I buy these

---------11:06----------
boards for like 15 30 bucks when they

---------11:08----------
when they're destroyed depending on what

---------11:10----------
type of board it is and how much is

---------11:11----------
missing off of it so I'm not really

---------11:14----------
sweating it and again the whole idea

---------11:15----------
here is to work quickly and efficiently

---------11:18----------
so it's it's valuable to be able to work

---------11:21----------
quickly and efficiently it's valuable to

---------11:22----------
me to be able to start what I'm doing

---------11:25----------
and just blaze through it I don't want

---------11:27----------
to sweat a couple you know a couple of

---------11:28----------
bucks here and there on parts that cost

---------11:31----------
me cents I just want to get going that's

---------11:36----------
another reason that I tell you people to

---------11:38----------
not order off of Mouser and

---------11:40----------
digi-key I'm not saying that Mouser and

---------11:41----------
did you cure bad vendors Mouser and

---------11:43----------
digi-key or excellent excellent vendors

---------11:45----------
the problem is that do you want to wait

---------11:47----------
a week every time you want to

---------11:49----------
troubleshoot something so let's say you

---------11:50----------
need that you think the logic gate is

---------11:52----------
what you need but do you want to wait a

---------11:54----------
week just to figure out that you need a

---------11:56----------
logic gate you understand I do you want

---------11:58----------
to wait a week just to figure out that

---------12:00----------
you needed something but the 90.9 kills

---------12:02----------
like a long resistor it's it's a waste

---------12:04----------
of time if you have to continuously buy

---------12:06----------
stuff wait for the order to get there

---------12:08----------
you know and then just to figure out

---------12:10----------
that there was something else all along

---------12:12----------
that you actually needed so this is a

---------12:15----------
bypass capacitor C 60 908 so that little

---------12:18----------
bypass capacitor looks like crap and

---------12:20----------
also there is the actual you 6901 which

---------12:25----------
itself looks like crap and that pad

---------12:27----------
looks like crap so I'm just going to

---------12:30----------
take those off I don't even care if that

---------12:31----------
logic gate was good

---------12:33----------
honest I don't care for all I know that

---------12:35----------
logic board was that logic gate was good

---------12:37----------
and the only issue that I actually had

---------12:38----------
here was that that component itself was

---------12:41----------
just within the pad on the board which

---------12:44----------
is nasty really it really just could

---------12:46----------
have been an issue of the actual of the

---------12:49----------
actual pad hey come on back hmm

---------13:02----------
so I'm scratching this pad off yeah long

---------13:09----------
time no see I always work all right so I

---------13:16----------
actually had a somebody come in who I

---------13:17----------
haven't spoken to in about eight years

---------13:19----------
so I decided to turn the camera off for

---------13:21----------
a second so back to what I was doing

---------13:23----------
over here so yeah I don't know if the

---------13:26----------
actual chip itself was bad or four which

---------13:28----------
is the trace and since this component

---------13:30----------
when you take into account the cost

---------13:32----------
these boards probably cost me no more

---------13:35----------
than a few cents I can't say I really

---------13:38----------
care so what I'm doing right now is I'm

---------13:40----------
just going over these solder pads over

---------13:41----------
here with the iron and there's one pad

---------13:45----------
in particular that's interesting to me

---------13:46----------
because it's kind of destroyed and I'm

---------13:53----------
probably going to be running a wire to

---------13:54----------
it so let's just see what this looks

---------13:57----------
like after a little bit of cleaning yeah

---------14:02----------
this this looks like crap

---------14:04----------
you can tell that there's a pad right

---------14:08----------
here that's scratched away and this

---------14:11----------
actually got stuck on my tweezers shoe

---------14:13----------
so let's see what we can do about that

---------14:14----------
pet we're just going to etch away a

---------14:21----------
little bit at the copper on the board

---------14:26----------
see what I'm doing here I'm kind of

---------14:28----------
trying to edge away at the copper on the

---------14:30----------
board so I can make space to put some

---------14:31----------
solder see yeah now I'm going to do the

---------14:35----------
same over here sometimes it's just

---------14:39----------
totally burnt in there really is

---------14:40----------
you can do but sometimes it isn't and

---------14:44----------
there so on the pad for the capacitor

---------14:48----------
the etching worked on the other one

---------14:51----------
there's just that I can do so we're

---------14:54----------
going to put that new components on

---------14:55----------
there and then we're going to go from

---------14:58----------
there I like to minimize misery and

---------15:00----------
troubleshooting so I want to try to get

---------15:02----------
rid of as many problems as I can at once

---------15:03----------
and that's my goal and since this thing

---------15:09----------
really is less than 17 cents to me I can

---------15:13----------
I can't say I care I'm also going to try

---------15:18----------
my best to not reflow the SMC which is

---------15:19----------
right next door there's really no need

---------15:21----------
to reflow the SMC if it works that's

---------15:23----------
just a nightmarish thing to do there's

---------15:26----------
just no reason for it

---------16:32----------
now this is done I'm going to plug it in

---------16:43----------
as you can see I get a green light now

---------16:47----------
let's see if it actually turns on with

---------16:49----------
the green light and then we can go on

---------16:51----------
and continue my troubleshooting so I get

---------17:00----------
a green light but no power on it could

---------17:09----------
be no power on or it could just be that

---------17:11----------
this testing found that I've dropped in

---------17:13----------
the floor about 90 times a day since

---------17:15----------
moving this desk over here is dead so

---------17:18----------
let's try the power fan from the actual

---------17:19----------
machine

---------17:30----------
okay so it doesn't turn on so here I'm

---------17:33----------
going to try turning it on an SMC bypass

---------17:35----------
mode since I at least have a green light

---------17:37----------
which requires a keyboard

---------18:01----------
so turning this on an SMC bypass mode

---------18:04----------
means I'm going to hold down the power

---------18:05----------
button on the keyboard for a few seconds

---------18:08----------
and then I'm going to plug the charger

---------18:10----------
in unfortunately when I do that it still

---------18:19----------
doesn't turn on except for now when it

---------18:24----------
actually just did just turn on now that

---------18:27----------
it's on an SMC bypass mode the whole

---------18:29----------
idea is ignoring everything that the SMC

---------18:31----------
is saying to turn on

---------19:11----------
so this thing that's turned on but it

---------19:13----------
turns out in SMC bypass mode which means

---------19:15----------
I'm going to have to replace the SMC

---------19:16----------
most likely it's going to be an issue

---------19:18----------
with the SMC I'm not going to include

---------19:20----------
that in this video because the SMC is a

---------19:22----------
nightmare what I'm going to have to do

---------19:23----------
is I'm gonna have to go through a bunch

---------19:24----------
of boards that look like this all

---------19:26----------
up with holes in them and take the SMC

---------19:28----------
off then I'm going to reball them with

---------19:30----------
0.25 millimeter balls then I'm gonna

---------19:32----------
have to solder it onto this board so I'm

---------19:34----------
gonna have to do BGA rework in order to

---------19:36----------
fix this but it's not BGA rework once

---------19:38----------
it's where I'm gonna have to do BGA

---------19:39----------
rework two or three or four or five

---------19:41----------
times because a lot of these boards over

---------19:43----------
here that get thrown away they get

---------19:45----------
thrown away because of a bad SMC you

---------19:47----------
can't just buy an SMC and put it on the

---------19:49----------
board you have to take it off of another

---------19:50----------
board because it comes with programming

---------19:52----------
and it's a chip that cannot be

---------19:53----------
programmed simply so it's going to be

---------19:55----------
about now or two hours of me just

---------19:57----------
sitting here and cursing doing the same

---------19:59----------
thing over and over again this is truly

---------20:01----------
no reason for me to include that on

---------20:02----------
camera because that really is not

---------20:03----------
beneficial to you so as I said the point

---------20:06----------
of this video is I wanted to make one

---------20:07----------
video where I explain the one wire

---------20:08----------
circuit from beginning to end so I'm

---------20:11----------
going to go over it one more time to

---------20:12----------
explain how this works

---------20:24----------
and this is a very basic explanation of

---------20:26----------
it

---------20:36----------
this here is the DC Jack pin five of the

---------20:40----------
DC jack is adapter sense adapter sense

---------20:43----------
goes from the charger through the DC n

---------20:47----------
board to this chip you 6900 when you

---------20:51----------
6900 sees 3.3 volts on pin 1 and the

---------20:56----------
adapter sense signal it sends a trigger

---------20:59----------
via sis 1 wire which is a bi-directional

---------21:02----------
line that goes between this chip and the

---------21:04----------
system management controller or in plain

---------21:06----------
English when this sees that the

---------21:09----------
charger works and that the charging

---------21:11----------
circuitry on the board works it tells

---------21:13----------
the SMC hey you're allowed to use the

---------21:15----------
charger now so the first signal that I

---------21:17----------
have must be present is charger sense

---------21:19----------
from the adapter the first thing that

---------21:21----------
must be present is a proper adapter sent

---------21:23----------
signal from the adapter meaning you have

---------21:25----------
to have a working DC n board so this

---------21:27----------
will be different with a non-working

---------21:29----------
DC n board you'll see something like a

---------21:31----------
straight up 16 volts instead of a

---------21:33----------
standard 3 volt signal so if this is 16

---------21:36----------
volts this usually doesn't work right

---------21:38----------
and that often happens with a bad DC n

---------21:39----------
board if you change your DC and board

---------21:41----------
and it's still not working you have to

---------21:43----------
check this circuit so first things first

---------21:46----------
you need to have smc BC a coming in

---------21:49----------
over here smc BC a must be high if

---------21:52----------
smc BC a is high meaning this is

---------21:55----------
3.3 volts but you still don't have a

---------21:57----------
green light look over here and you have

---------21:59----------
a good DC n board it's most likely an

---------22:02----------
issue over here so one of these chips is

---------22:04----------
usually corroded because they're on the

---------22:05----------
edge of the board usually this one this

---------22:07----------
chip over here is attached to a main

---------22:09----------
power rail the machine main power rails

---------22:11----------
are what go bad on the machine main

---------22:13----------
power rails if they send the voltage

---------22:14----------
spike through it or what's going or

---------22:16----------
we're going to get damaged so over here

---------22:18----------
you have PP 3 V 4 to underscore g3 hunt

---------22:21----------
this is a main power rail connecting

---------22:22----------
over here this is a very very common via

---------22:24----------
to corrode also it very often takes this

---------22:28----------
chip out with it so if you see SM CBC a

---------22:30----------
car coming in here but it's not coming

---------22:33----------
out on pin 4 check this power line or if

---------22:36----------
this power line is here and SM CBC a

---------22:39----------
 is here but nothing's coming out

---------22:40----------
then you have a bad chip again the whole

---------22:43----------
point of the circuit is this one wire is

---------22:45----------
going to tell the SMC allow the charger

---------22:47----------
to turn green allow the light on the

---------22:49----------
chart

---------22:49----------
to turn green if the ascent signal is

---------22:53----------
present properly and there's voltage

---------22:55----------
here there will not be voltage here

---------22:57----------
unless this logic gate lets this through

---------23:00----------
it's not going to let this do if it's

---------23:02----------
not getting power or is screwed up in

---------23:03----------
some way if you don't have SMC BC a

---------23:06----------
then you need to start troubleshooting

---------23:08----------
why you don't have SMC BC a SMC BC

---------23:11----------
a comes out from charger a in

---------23:13----------
the area of you 7,000 come on render my

---------23:16----------
PDF I give you a good processing power

---------23:18----------
it's all jagged and whatnot charger a

---------23:21----------
 comes out over here charger a

---------23:23----------
which turns into SMC BC a is not

---------23:25----------
going to come out if this chip is

---------23:27----------
up is not going to come out if this chip

---------23:29----------
has a hole in it is not going to come

---------23:30----------
out if anything is wrong with the

---------23:31----------
circuit so the things that you're

---------23:33----------
looking for to be correct with the

---------23:34----------
circuit is charger AC in you need 4

---------23:36----------
volts on this pin the 4 volts on this

---------23:38----------
pin are created from a voltage divider

---------23:39----------
going from the adapter to our 70 10 and

---------23:42----------
our 70 11 a voltage divider is going to

---------23:45----------
take a higher voltage and turn it into a

---------23:46----------
lower voltage if you don't know what a

---------23:47----------
voltage divider is Google it because

---------23:49----------
you're going to need have to know how

---------23:50----------
this works in order to repair these

---------23:51----------
products that ding also means that my

---------23:53----------
nature GPU replacement is ready to go

---------23:54----------
now if you look over here there's also

---------23:57----------
something called a current sensing

---------23:58----------
circuit I'm going to get into this in a

---------24:00----------
different video the hole I don't want to

---------24:01----------
get too much to do in this video the

---------24:03----------
whole idea behind how this works there's

---------24:04----------
going to be a voltage drop across this

---------24:06----------
resistor this chip measures the voltage

---------24:08----------
drop across this resistor in order to

---------24:10----------
figure out how much current the computer

---------24:11----------
is actually using so you have this

---------24:13----------
resistor R 70 20 coming from the charger

---------24:16----------
then there's a ratan ohm resistor going

---------24:18----------
to you 7,000 and the beginning of this

---------24:20----------
and then at the end of this there's

---------24:21----------
another 10 ohm resistor going to you

---------24:22----------
77,000 it's going to be able to tell the

---------24:25----------
voltage difference between here and by

---------24:26----------
telling that it's going to be able to

---------24:27----------
tell the amount of current the system is

---------24:28----------
using I'm not going to get into the math

---------24:30----------
I'm not going to get into the formulism

---------24:31----------
how this is possible because you don't

---------24:33----------
need to know any of that and if I

---------24:34----------
explain things that you don't need to

---------24:35----------
know it's just going to result in

---------24:37----------
unnecessary confusion so let's keep it

---------24:39----------
simple if the current sensing circuitry

---------24:41----------
senses the charger is taking too much

---------24:42----------
power it may not turn on the charge or a

---------24:45----------
clock signal allowing the charger to

---------24:47----------
work so the whole point of this is

---------24:48----------
protection the whole point this is to

---------24:50----------
see how much power is the charge you're

---------24:52----------
using so if something's wrong here or

---------24:54----------
one of these resistors is out of whack

---------24:55----------
and it causes the u 7000 to think that

---------24:57----------
the charger is using 9,000 amps it's

---------25:00----------
obviously going to turn off the charger

---------25:01----------
meaning it's going to turn off this

---------25:02----------
you're a signal so if you don't

---------25:05----------
have SM CBC a if you don't have SM

---------25:08----------
CBC a over here check the news out

---------25:10----------
of the 7000 area if you do have M CBC a

---------25:14----------
 here then you have to check this

---------25:16----------
area to see what's wrong and again this

---------25:18----------
really is just following the numbers

---------25:20----------
following the lines to figure out the

---------25:22----------
issues this is a very very common issue

---------25:23----------
because this is if they have this

---------25:25----------
smallest via going to the smallest logic

---------25:27----------
gate right on the edge of the board it

---------25:29----------
loves to get up by water and is a

---------25:31----------
very very common fault so again I am

---------25:33----------
going to be going down a rabbit hole

---------25:34----------
with this board to make it work again

---------25:35----------
but I did solve what I set out to show

---------25:38----------
you in this video which is that how to

---------25:41----------
fix and how to troubleshoot one wire

---------25:43----------
circuit issues and that's about it for

---------25:45----------
today
