---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're gonna get started on an a 1989

---------00:03----------
that is not turning on

---------00:05----------
let's see fix this machine and make it

---------00:08----------
work again first thing to do is the

---------00:11----------
corona the machine Die Corona dye dye

---------00:17----------
Corona dye dye beer virus dye it reeks

---------00:23----------
of coffee this definitely smells like

---------00:25----------
the laptop of a drug addict

---------00:27----------
I say drug addict because I've dealt

---------00:34----------
with many people co-workers and

---------00:36----------
employees that will say and admit

---------00:39----------
themselves I cannot wake up without

---------00:42----------
coffee

---------00:43----------
I cannot get my job done without an

---------00:45----------
espresso I cannot do this so by their

---------00:47----------
own admission they are drug addicts and

---------00:49----------
I just kind of find it particularly

---------00:51----------
interesting that it's totally ok and

---------00:53----------
legal and cheap for one type of drug

---------00:55----------
that changes your state of mind to exist

---------00:58----------
in the way you make decisions yet it is

---------01:00----------
illegal for others to exist but such as

---------01:05----------
the world that we live in so let's see

---------01:10----------
what this does as always I am going to

---------01:12----------
unplug the battery battery cable plug

---------01:16----------
this in see you we get coffee smells

---------01:25----------
disgusting too so we have 5 volts 200

---------01:29----------
milliamps now we have 19 volts 83

---------01:32----------
milliamps 64 mill amps 200 milliamps 197

---------01:36----------
million four hundred sixty-six milliamps

---------01:37----------
the fan is spinning the fan is not

---------01:41----------
spinning

---------01:43----------
seems like this crap inside the fan and

---------01:45----------
we're stuck at 200 milliamps croissant

---------01:48----------
repair guide you made is fantastic thank

---------01:49----------
you James I'm glad that someone's making

---------01:51----------
use of it you know one of the things

---------01:53----------
that got me to stop teaching courses in

---------01:55----------
person is how discouraged I got when I

---------01:57----------
realized that people that paid to take a

---------01:59----------
class with me would not take the time to

---------02:01----------
read that guide that was incredibly

---------02:03----------
incredibly depressing all right so it's

---------02:06----------
turning on 200 milliamps fan spinning

---------02:09----------
this thing's probably booting most

---------02:12----------
likely if the liquid got

---------02:13----------
near the screen cable we're not getting

---------02:15----------
a picture on the screen because this the

---------02:17----------
data line was destroyed which I'm

---------02:19----------
guessing is the case here and we're

---------02:21----------
gonna take a look and confirm that in a

---------02:23----------
moment first thing we're gonna do is

---------02:30----------
turn on Paul Daniels as a software I

---------02:32----------
know it's a last resort

---------02:37----------
no backlight voltage so I'm gonna unplug

---------02:41----------
this thing and we're gonna take a look

---------02:44----------
at the screen cable area I can already

---------02:48----------
see that there is some corrosion around

---------02:50----------
the CPU MOSFETs over here so that means

---------02:53----------
it's not far-fetched to think that

---------02:54----------
corrosion got under there now the way

---------02:57----------
this works is the the backlight line for

---------03:04----------
screen backlight which is about 50 volts

---------03:06----------
is right next to the CPU data line for

---------03:09----------
image which is about 1.7 volts and

---------03:11----------
because this is a [ __ ] MacBook

---------03:13----------
because this is a MacBook they put them

---------03:16----------
right next to each other and every other

---------03:18----------
computer that I've ever opened they do

---------03:19----------
not put the 1 point 7 volt image data

---------03:23----------
line that goes straight to the CPU right

---------03:25----------
next to a 52 volt power line that is

---------03:28----------
designed to power a backlight like

---------03:30----------
lowest voltage line for data highest

---------03:32----------
voltage line for their backlight and in

---------03:37----------
MacBook they do that I can show you how

---------03:41----------
this looks on the schematic in a moment

---------03:43----------
and then I will show you what it looks

---------03:44----------
like on the board and then I will tell

---------03:46----------
you what the prognosis is for our

---------03:47----------
customer so let's go through that here

---------03:50----------
so if we take a look at the board you'll

---------03:53----------
see that the screen connector is gonna

---------03:55----------
be right over here right here Jay

---------04:02----------
8500 is for EDP connector which stands

---------04:05----------
for embedded DisplayPort not emotionally

---------04:07----------
disturbed person although admittedly you

---------04:09----------
would have to be an emotionally

---------04:10----------
disturbed person to be responsible for

---------04:12----------
the design of this product as I will

---------04:14----------
showcase once I have the connector on

---------04:16----------
the screen if you take a look here you

---------04:20----------
have the backlight line PBV out Sol CD

---------04:24----------
booklet and that's going to be right

---------04:26----------
next to

---------04:27----------
EDP and ox which is a data line that

---------04:33----------
goes to the CPU for the picture so take

---------04:36----------
a look over here so you have backlight

---------04:38----------
image backlight image now where does

---------04:42----------
image go image goes straight to the CPU

---------04:45----------
now do you think that the CPU likes

---------04:47----------
getting 50 volts no it does not and

---------04:50----------
here's what it's going to look like on

---------04:52----------
the machine itself when this happens and

---------04:55----------
by the way one of the things that you

---------04:56----------
should be aware of it's not like this

---------04:58----------
connector where they have 52 volts right

---------05:00----------
next to one volt is in some hidden away

---------05:02----------
part of the computer it's in the very

---------05:04----------
edge right here right on the edge where

---------05:08----------
the coffee is going to spill into see

---------05:14----------
this look at this so this over here is

---------05:21----------
where 52 volt backlight one point seven

---------05:25----------
volt data 52 volt backlight one point

---------05:29----------
seven volt data so it's not that the

---------05:31----------
computers not turning on the is turning

---------05:34----------
on but it has no image and there's

---------05:36----------
nothing in between that CPU data line

---------05:38----------
and here no choke no nothing just

---------05:41----------
straight to the CPU

---------05:43----------
so the CPU needs to be replaced on the

---------05:45----------
board now do you think I can just call

---------05:49----------
up Intel and get the CPU no do you think

---------05:52----------
our distributors lining up to make these

---------05:56----------
for sale to people like me not really so

---------05:59----------
what you need to do is you need to go on

---------06:01----------
Aliexpress and pay 2 to 600 bucks for a

---------06:04----------
CPU of questionable quality that for all

---------06:07----------
you know is ripped off of another dead

---------06:08----------
board and solder it onto here a very

---------06:12----------
high risk because you don't know if what

---------06:13----------
you're buying actually works be very

---------06:16----------
expensive so customer's gonna give you a

---------06:18----------
middle finger all of this could have

---------06:20----------
been resolved if the person designing

---------06:22----------
this pin out thought to themselves for

---------06:24----------
just a second maybe it's maybe it's a

---------06:28----------
bad idea to have the 52 volt power line

---------06:31----------
right next to the 1 point 7 volt data

---------06:33----------
line when that's right on the edge of

---------06:35----------
the computer where liquid is going to

---------06:37----------
fall in on a device that has no liquid

---------06:39----------
resistance

---------06:41----------
but I'm no engineer so what do I know

---------06:43----------
Thank You Jay Kurtz so this machine

---------06:46----------
needs a CPU probably going to be a very

---------06:48----------
unhappy customer but what do you what

---------06:52----------
are you gonna do what you gonna do and

---------06:55----------
you know what the funny thing is they

---------06:56----------
started designing this thing in 2016

---------06:58----------
it's 2020 and the MacBooks that Apple

---------07:01----------
are making now in 2020 of this exact

---------07:03----------
same design the extant design 52 volt

---------07:06----------
power line one point seven volt data

---------07:08----------
line right next to each other
