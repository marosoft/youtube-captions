---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're gonna be working on yet another

---------00:03----------
dead MacBook this is a MacBook Air that

---------00:06----------
says it needs board repair this is an

---------00:07----------
814 66 one of the last models made

---------00:10----------
before they took the El and started

---------00:12----------
using the butterfly keyboards and all

---------00:15----------
that rubbish so let's open this up and

---------00:18----------
see what's going on with it and see if

---------00:19----------
we can make it work again the area we

---------00:22----------
have the MacBook so first thing I'm

---------00:23----------
gonna do is I'm gonna unplug the battery

---------00:24----------
from this macbook after unplugging the

---------00:27----------
battery I'm going to plug in my MagSafe

---------00:31----------
power adapter and I'm also going to get

---------00:36----------
the charging amperage all that good

---------00:39----------
stuff showing up on the screen over here

---------00:41----------
so you can see how much amperage it's

---------00:42----------
taking knowing how much amperage it's

---------00:45----------
taking is gonna tell me interesting

---------00:46----------
clues now this one takes 66 ml amps has

---------00:50----------
no green light and the charger let's try

---------00:52----------
and figure it out while you don't have a

---------00:53----------
green light in the charger so first

---------00:55----------
thing I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna

---------00:56----------
remove the board from its casing so that

---------00:58----------
I can examine it properly the board has

---------01:02----------
been removed from the MacBook it's the

---------01:04----------
first thing we're gonna do since we

---------01:05----------
weren't getting a green light is check

---------01:07----------
and see that PP 3 v 4 to underscore g3

---------01:09----------
Honda's present and now it is present

---------01:11----------
Wow instead of taking 70 milliamps it's

---------01:14----------
taking 6 milliamps that's interesting

---------01:16----------
because we just went from one version of

---------01:18----------
broken to another version of broken

---------01:20----------
quite strange so the first thing I'm

---------01:23----------
gonna do here is check and see the P P 3

---------01:25----------
P 4 to underscore g3 on is present and

---------01:28----------
from what I see here it looks like it is

---------01:33----------
next up

---------01:34----------
P P bus g3 hot so what I'm doing here is

---------01:36----------
I'm going down a list of available power

---------01:38----------
rails this is an 8 - 0 - 0 0 165 board

---------01:43----------
and if I have the machine could come in

---------01:47----------
with an issue of not turning on that

---------01:48----------
what I'm gonna want to do is look

---------01:50----------
through the power else or no power let's

---------01:53----------
check out the power rails and see if any

---------01:54----------
of those rails are missing just like on

---------01:56----------
your desktop PC if those molex

---------01:58----------
connectors so we have the 12 volts 5

---------02:00----------
volts and ground on there you know you

---------02:02----------
get if you even if you don't really work

---------02:04----------
on laptop boards like this you have an

---------02:05----------
idea of what the what power rails mean

---------02:10----------
just from that basic understanding of

---------02:12----------
having

---------02:12----------
built a computer and that's what we're

---------02:14----------
looking at here now I go through this

---------02:17----------
list and I check out my rails

---------02:19----------
you know g3 hot rails are rails that are

---------02:21----------
always on as five rails are gonna be

---------02:24----------
rails that are only on when the machine

---------02:26----------
is off as for rails our rails that are

---------02:29----------
going to be on when the machine is

---------02:31----------
hibernating as a rails or rails that are

---------02:34----------
gonna be on when the machine is on and

---------02:35----------
as three rails or rails that are gonna

---------02:37----------
be on when the machine is sleeping so

---------02:39----------
we're gonna go through the list of rails

---------02:40----------
on this machine and see what's going on

---------02:42----------
with it so let's check out something

---------02:43----------
like ppv RTC underscore g3 hunt it's as

---------02:46----------
it's located on the other side of the

---------02:47----------
board so I just flip my board over and

---------02:50----------
make a quick measurement right here and

---------02:55----------
it's not showing up so let's take a look

---------02:58----------
there so remember I first I go through

---------03:00----------
all of my g3 hots

---------03:02----------
then my s 5 s then my s4 is in my series

---------03:05----------
in my esos so in order to have you and

---------03:07----------
s3 rail all your s fours got to be

---------03:09----------
present you know what I mean s4 rail all

---------03:10----------
your s fives have to be present in order

---------03:12----------
to have as five rails all of your dreary

---------03:14----------
haunts have to be present and so on and

---------03:16----------
so forth so I don't have ppv RTC

---------03:19----------
underscore g3 huh so we're gonna take a

---------03:21----------
look at the board and see what that oh

---------03:23----------
well there you go what do you all see

---------03:27----------
over here see that green stuff that's

---------03:32----------
corrosion that is corrosion now I wonder

---------03:37----------
if that capacitor over there has

---------03:40----------
short-circuited its way to ground and if

---------03:44----------
that's the result it's shorting that

---------03:46----------
power rail to ground well let's see so I

---------03:49----------
can turn my multimeter to resistance or

---------03:52----------
ohms mode and get this on the screen and

---------03:55----------
see what the resistance is here 1.4 ohms

---------04:01----------
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

---------04:03----------
professionally flick that off the board

---------04:05----------
like poof with that see I'm a

---------04:09----------
professional I could knock components

---------04:10----------
off like that don't try that at home

---------04:12----------
kids it's only left to professionals and

---------04:16----------
scrape their

---------04:23----------
let's see if my shirt is gone now

---------04:27----------
now we're getting 28 moans so it looks

---------04:31----------
like that capacitor that had that little

---------04:33----------
bit of corrosion on it was causing a

---------04:35----------
short-circuit and that short circuit was

---------04:37----------
keeping it from working so I'm going to

---------04:40----------
add a little bit of flux there some

---------04:43----------
solder and put a new camp there now this

---------04:46----------
is gonna work without that cap there

---------04:48----------
there's a lot of capacitors on ppv RTC

---------04:50----------
underscore g3 hot there's a lot of caps

---------04:53----------
on that rail already so if one of them

---------04:57----------
is missing in that area it's not gonna

---------04:59----------
be the ends of the world to you even

---------05:03----------
though this is close to the crystal but

---------05:05----------
I've had machines run just fine with

---------05:06----------
that missing and not freeze or anything

---------05:08----------
but it's still a good idea to put it

---------05:10----------
back all right so where I ripped that

---------05:15----------
cap off the board you're gonna see that

---------05:16----------
I just able to magically bring it back I

---------05:20----------
didn't even remove the pad again that's

---------05:21----------
not something that I would do at home

---------05:23----------
it's gonna be a lot of practice before

---------05:25----------
you can do stuff like that Jessa does it

---------05:27----------
on streem regularly and makes it look

---------05:29----------
easy but jess has been doing it for like

---------05:32----------
six years now so okay I'm going to take

---------05:39----------
another capacitor from a donor MacBook

---------05:43----------
Air and we're gonna replace it and when

---------05:48----------
I replace that it's probably going to

---------05:49----------
work and once it works Paul is going to

---------05:52----------
probably scream at me and the reason he

---------05:54----------
would scream at me is because I managed

---------05:57----------
to pick all these boards random and they

---------06:00----------
always managed to be fixable whereas the

---------06:02----------
boards that Paul chooses even when he

---------06:04----------
tries to choose ones he winds up getting

---------06:06----------
the ones that are not fixable

---------06:09----------
poor bastard

---------06:13----------
everybody type F in the chat for Paul

---------06:18----------
Paul s

---------06:24----------
now one of the things I was talking

---------06:26----------
about in the previous video is that I

---------06:28----------
keep the board I'm working on under the

---------06:30----------
microscope

---------06:31----------
and I if when I'm stealing a component

---------06:33----------
from a donor board I don't do that in

---------06:35----------
the microscope it makes things more

---------06:37----------
efficient for me so if I'm moving

---------06:39----------
something from one board to another with

---------06:41----------
my tweezers it's not I can't put this

---------06:43----------
down on the desk and then move

---------06:45----------
everything like that's not gonna work if

---------06:47----------
you look at this these components are

---------06:49----------
ridiculously small once I put that

---------06:50----------
component down is disappearing into the

---------06:52----------
fifth dimension so I have my desk this

---------06:54----------
is my donor board I use my eyes I pick

---------06:57----------
it up and I don't care if I'm knocking

---------06:58----------
stuff off around because this is a donor

---------07:00----------
board this board is a complete piece of

---------07:03----------
junk I don't care if I ruin it

---------07:04----------
so I remove my cap and then I go into

---------07:07----------
the microscope over here to do my actual

---------07:09----------
work it's it's much more efficient than

---------07:12----------
like then what many people will do which

---------07:15----------
is okay I'm gonna take the cap off of

---------07:17----------
here and I've had so many students do

---------07:18----------
this they take the cap of like oh

---------07:19----------
what do I do now and then they're like

---------07:21----------
the okay they they find a place to put

---------07:23----------
this board then they grab this and I'll

---------07:25----------
look this boards tangled on a wire so I

---------07:27----------
twist it and they do this and by that

---------07:30----------
time the component they had in their

---------07:31----------
tweezer it's gone it's done it flew away

---------07:33----------
because you know it's it's this tiny so

---------07:37----------
after the man named Paul indeed f-for

---------07:39----------
the man named Paul so anyway we replaced

---------07:42----------
that campus sitter and now we're gonna

---------07:44----------
see if this works and it probably is

---------07:46----------
gonna work and Paul's probably gonna be

---------07:47----------
really mad at me because I got one that

---------07:49----------
was fairly simple and straightforward

---------07:53----------
and what do you know the fan is spinning

---------07:55----------
look at that random random so as I was

---------08:00----------
saying about the power rails over here

---------08:01----------
and this is an important thing to know

---------08:03----------
very important it's something that I do

---------08:04----------
go over in my document that is linked

---------08:07----------
down below and that is a freely

---------08:09----------
available document that you can read

---------08:10----------
it's about a hundred 150 page guide on

---------08:13----------
introduction aboard repair it's an

---------08:14----------
important document and it's available as

---------08:16----------
I said for free so when you have no

---------08:18----------
power I like to go to this page on the

---------08:20----------
schematic called power aliases and it's

---------08:22----------
going to be called different things in

---------08:24----------
different for different schematics for

---------08:26----------
different machines but on the MacBook

---------08:27----------
it's the power Elias page and on that

---------08:29----------
list it's gonna give you a list of the

---------08:30----------
different power lines that are required

---------08:32----------
in that machine and if some of these are

---------08:33----------
missing it's not going to work right so

---------08:35----------
there's going to be preface as to all

---------08:37----------
those let's just go

---------08:38----------
/ what these things mean so there's a

---------08:42----------
prefix and a suffix the preface is

---------08:44----------
usually prefix is gonna tell you what

---------08:47----------
that power line is how many volts to

---------08:50----------
expect there and the suffix is gonna

---------08:51----------
tell you when to expect it so over here

---------08:54----------
let's just take an example of pp 3 V 3

---------08:57----------
underscore s 4

---------08:59----------
pp 3 V 3 underscore s 4 right then so P

---------09:06----------
P 3 P 3 underscore is 4 P P 3 V 3 3.3

---------09:10----------
volts the V is often a decimal point so

---------09:12----------
3.3 volts s 4 will be present when in s

---------09:15----------
4 state when the machine is hibernating

---------09:18----------
if we check out p pd c ng 3 hot DC n

---------09:22----------
like the charger anytime the charges

---------09:24----------
plugged in that rails gonna be on g3 on

---------09:26----------
it's on all the time PP but g 3 hot

---------09:28----------
that's a rail that's going to be present

---------09:30----------
all the time that's the rail for the

---------09:32----------
battery if we check out PP 5 es 5 5

---------09:36----------
volts that's gonna be present when

---------09:37----------
you're in an S 5 State and remember when

---------09:39----------
it comes to states G 3 hot always on as

---------09:42----------
5 that realism and the computers off as

---------09:44----------
for that rails are on when the computers

---------09:46----------
hibernating s 3 that rails on the

---------09:48----------
computer sleeping as o that rail is

---------09:50----------
gonna be on when the machine is actually

---------09:51----------
working in front of you and running

---------09:52----------
programs so for example an s3 rail would

---------09:56----------
be a rail for memory so when you put the

---------10:00----------
computer in sleep or suspend mode your

---------10:03----------
programs all it remembers what you're

---------10:04----------
doing in all your programs because the

---------10:06----------
RAM is what's storing everything so in

---------10:09----------
order for it to go to sleep the RAM has

---------10:11----------
to be getting power even if stuff like

---------10:12----------
the other screen or the CPU which RSO

---------10:14----------
rails are not and s Oreille is gonna be

---------10:18----------
something like the CPU the graphics chip

---------10:21----------
the screen backlight stuff like that

---------10:23----------
that those are rails that have to be

---------10:25----------
present when the machine is on and you

---------10:27----------
need your S 5 s and S 4 is in order to

---------10:30----------
get your s 3 s in s oh it's a capira mat

---------10:31----------
so if these are not present these rails

---------10:34----------
are actually often creating those rails

---------10:36----------
but further if these rails are not on

---------10:38----------
the computer checks itself and says well

---------10:40----------
these are not on we're not going to turn

---------10:41----------
on the rest what starts these then these

---------10:42----------
then these then these in a sequence so

---------10:45----------
let's say Y let's just bring up why it's

---------10:48----------
important so let's say that you check

---------10:50----------
and you see that PP 5 ESO is

---------10:52----------
present but the machine is not turning

---------10:53----------
on well you just save yourself some time

---------10:55----------
you don't got to go through this entire

---------10:56----------
list and check every single rail because

---------10:59----------
that's gonna be a waste of time

---------11:00----------
why am I gonna check all these s threes

---------11:02----------
and sus ng3 hot and s five and all that

---------11:06----------
other stuff no if the machine is not

---------11:08----------
turning on but you have a single Sol

---------11:10----------
present that means that all you got a

---------11:11----------
check or the other Essos now if you

---------11:13----------
check an S for rail and even the s for

---------11:15----------
rail is not present then that means that

---------11:18----------
that's gonna be a little bit less fun

---------11:20----------
because that means now you got a check

---------11:21----------
everything you're gonna have to go

---------11:23----------
through every single rail to figure out

---------11:26----------
which is the one that short circuit are

---------11:28----------
potentially not turning on it's less fun

---------11:29----------
so this machine turns on now we had a

---------11:32----------
short to ground on PPV RTC underscore g3

---------11:34----------
huh

---------11:35----------
that is a rail responsible for creating

---------11:37----------
the clock voltage and we knocked off a

---------11:40----------
cap fix the short replace the cap just

---------11:43----------
to be nice and it works we're gonna run

---------11:44----------
this board through the ultrasonic

---------11:45----------
cleaner because this board had a bit of

---------11:48----------
a liquid on it and even if that was all

---------11:51----------
I could see with my eyes I don't quite

---------11:52----------
trust it I can see this layer with my

---------11:55----------
eyes but I can't see underneath chips

---------11:57----------
like this so this over here I can't see

---------12:00----------
underneath the CPU or underneath the

---------12:02----------
system management controller I can see

---------12:04----------
this layer but chips like this that have

---------12:06----------
ninety balls under them or chips like

---------12:08----------
this that have 900 balls under them I

---------12:10----------
can't see that with my eye so I don't

---------12:12----------
know if this corrosion happening under

---------12:13----------
there so to prevent any sort of

---------12:14----------
corrosion from occurring into the future

---------12:15----------
I will put this board through an

---------12:17----------
ultrasonic cleaner available it's stored

---------12:19----------
on trosman group.com and that's it for

---------12:22----------
today and as always I hope you learned

---------12:24----------
something

---------12:54----------
excellent data recovery not the best

---------12:56----------
camera

---------13:02----------
what happened Steve what do you think is

---------13:08----------
gonna happen if you sit and think that

---------13:09----------
it's me to run through it you push
