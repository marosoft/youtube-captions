---------00:59----------
donation for the employee this donation

---------01:09----------
 like this Kevin gave this to me a

---------01:13----------
train oh let me take out the battery

---------01:16----------
before I just start shoving my tweezers

---------01:19----------
into stuff CPU inductor CPU and doctor

---------01:24----------
CPU MOSFETs ground CPU ground CPU Luis

---------01:39----------
come back please I need you okay let's

---------01:42----------
see let's see why this MacBook doesn't

---------01:44----------
turn on I'm gonna clean as much as I can

---------01:46----------
where's my brush please we're gonna make

---------01:49----------
this MacBook great again

---------01:53----------
come on come on please please I don't

---------01:56----------
want the zel now no more Zell no no boys

---------02:02----------
now help all time of the year

---------02:07----------
plug this in no green light

---------02:12----------
oh wait okay so we turning on chime no

---------02:24----------
you don't want to chime for me

---------02:30----------
huh you don't have green light which

---------02:34----------
isn't really an issue could be a DC and

---------02:38----------
board problem but we do have fence man

---------02:42----------
at five hundred million five hundred

---------02:45----------
milliamps so wanna see if this thing

---------02:49----------
turns on interesting oh cool nice uh I

---------02:57----------
should probably open these before if you

---------03:00----------
guys want a hot date you know and you

---------03:10----------
know what happened if you hate Kevin you

---------03:16----------
would do it okay so we have fans been do

---------03:23----------
we have backlight

---------03:28----------
this is confusing we have back late cool

---------03:31----------
so we should have Apple logo and we do

---------03:33----------
have that below go awesome

---------03:35----------
but do you boot completely it's supposed

---------03:38----------
to boot okay one sec so it says it

---------03:46----------
doesn't charge her battery yeah so let's

---------03:49----------
see if it's recognizing battery so the s

---------03:54----------
and C has to be alive for that to happen

---------03:56----------
and we get eight point five okay so it

---------04:00----------
she probably might just have a bad

---------04:01----------
battery okay I see okay she needs a new

---------04:04----------
DC and board could you get that for me

---------04:08----------
dude yeah so yeah there's corrosion on a

---------04:12----------
DC and board and pull at the microscope

---------04:13----------
for you guys so the thing in the thing

---------04:15----------
is with airs the one wire circuit is

---------04:20----------
actually on the DCN board itself and not

---------04:24----------
the not on the board kind of cool so

---------04:29----------
whenever you don't have a green light

---------04:30----------
issue you should check out your one wire

---------04:34----------
and make sure it doesn't look like this

---------04:36----------
if I can so here's the two chips

---------04:40----------
responsible for one wire circuit and

---------04:42----------
they're both I think this one just

---------04:48----------
completely off what is it yeah yeah

---------04:52----------
there's no legs on this one there should

---------04:54----------
be three legs there's no legs gross

---------04:57----------
feels bad oh well nice job Kevin you

---------05:02----------
didn't up

---------05:05----------
okay so back to desk and we're gonna

---------05:10----------
solve this we're gonna look at the rest

---------05:14----------
of the board see if there's any other

---------05:15----------
bits of corrosion we could probably

---------05:16----------
clean up Oh Kevin you know that issue

---------05:19----------
that you just told me yeah yeah I guess

---------05:21----------
where it comes from

---------05:24----------
no the the thing the thing you told me

---------05:27----------
where it comes from the DCN board okay

---------05:36----------
so Kevin did not want to tell me that

---------05:39----------
the customer was complaining that her

---------05:42----------
audio was muted on the state they got to

---------05:48----------
know why this MacBook isn't working the

---------05:50----------
audio comes from the DCN board a lot of

---------05:54----------
things come from the DCN board I might

---------05:56----------
run it through you when we open up the

---------05:58----------
board view for this but a lot of things

---------06:02----------
come from the DCN board which is really

---------06:04----------
necessary I'm surprised this is in a

---------06:06----------
dead CPU that's all I care about

---------06:10----------
I will Docs every one of our customers

---------06:14----------
as long as I don't get a dead CPU hand

---------06:19----------
me a 15 34 liquid damage that gold one

---------06:21----------
yes yes yes yes yes yes I will I will

---------06:25----------
gladly look at a 1534 why'd you give me

---------06:32----------
every single 1534 put that back I said

---------06:36----------
liquid damage no power not just no power

---------06:40----------
if it says no power it's dead

---------06:41----------
you know that that's what I was

---------06:44----------
referring to okay

---------06:46----------
so every connector is off the board you

---------06:52----------
know take it out up screw

---------06:56----------
the boards on these of course is they're

---------07:00----------
small they're useless that's how they

---------07:04----------
gets that's how that's how they get hot

---------07:06----------
so fast dude I'm losing it

---------07:09----------
I just ate and now I'm brains just there

---------07:14----------
we go okay now don't crack under

---------07:16----------
pressure well pressure is there Louis is

---------07:19----------
watching okay

---------07:24----------
so Kevin my lovely assistant has handed

---------07:29----------
me a new decian board smile to the

---------07:34----------
camera come on Kevin he's such a good

---------07:39----------
guy he's still here I don't know maybe

---------07:43----------
Louis likes him too much

---------07:44----------
you got that charm I can't move this

---------07:47----------
camera i'ma drop Louis's camera

---------07:49----------
Kevin turn around move away from the

---------07:51----------
microscope so they can see you that's

---------07:56----------
Kevin he winked at you Kevin is single

---------08:00----------
feel free I try I try making I'm not

---------08:03----------
single it doesn't work what's wrong with

---------08:07----------
the 1534 no power they don't get proper

---------08:11----------
heat dissipation so the cpu just goes

---------08:16----------
and and they expect us to like fix it

---------08:20----------
Louis expects me to fix it no okay so

---------08:27----------
we're gonna get our new decian board I

---------08:30----------
feel like the cable is fine so I'm just

---------08:33----------
gonna rip their cable inspect their

---------08:37----------
cable

---------08:40----------
their cable is not fine microscope can

---------08:50----------
[Music]

---------08:54----------
that's not a good cable that pin just

---------09:01----------
isn't

---------09:02----------
I missed a view in the front yeah yeah

---------09:07----------
get me a new cable oh crap crap crap

---------09:15----------
crap that's not good

---------09:17----------
we know that's from the DC oh thank god

---------09:19----------
it's from no it's 2013 here you want to

---------09:27----------
like put them side-by-side okay so what

---------09:34----------
I'll saying is that's can because I

---------09:36----------
can't do those yeah

---------09:37----------
so the pins are burnt on this side which

---------09:40----------
is great because that's coming from the

---------09:42----------
DCN board if it came from this side I

---------09:43----------
would have to look at this connector and

---------09:46----------
probably replace it which is pain in the

---------09:48----------
ass dude okay so new cable which one's

---------09:52----------
the new cable is the bad one get rid of

---------09:53----------
that so you got new cable new board

---------10:03----------
what what is it huh

---------10:06----------
I could probably do it it normally takes

---------10:12----------
30 minutes but I'm doing it so it's

---------10:13----------
gonna be an hour okay so now nudie scene

---------10:27----------
but we should have green light boom

---------10:29----------
green light Fenn Fenn Fenn Fenn hey hey

---------10:34----------
hey give me Finn's pin

---------10:35----------
what are you doing hello fans man hey

---------10:38----------
fixed okay okay cool

---------10:44----------
whoo so all this needs is probably just

---------10:50----------
a you see and a new board

---------10:52----------
it's a microscope and I'll just run

---------10:55----------
through see if there's any more

---------10:56----------
corrosion on his board so yeah these

---------11:01----------
look really bad but they're not

---------11:12----------
gross but not not destroyed totally fine

---------11:18----------
totally fine

---------11:20----------
let's see let's see

---------11:22----------
SMC reset little Cody that's fine that's

---------11:26----------
fine

---------11:26----------

---------11:34----------
right this is

---------11:43----------
