---------00:00----------
hello again and welcome back to another

---------00:01----------
episode of hunting liquid damage we're

---------00:04----------
gonna be giving this DP a define 88

---------00:06----------
microphone one more chance before I toss

---------00:09----------
it out the issue that I have is if you

---------00:11----------
move your head from left to right or up

---------00:13----------
or down it this thing whew it's so

---------00:16----------
 flimsy it is so flimsy so flimsy

---------00:19----------
compared to the DPA 40 65 it's a joke

---------00:23----------
this this wireframe mic you put it on

---------00:25----------
and it stays in place you put this on

---------00:27----------
and you can even see it vibrating back

---------00:29----------
and forth drives me absolutely out of my

---------00:31----------
mind but we're gonna give it one more

---------00:33----------
chance before I wind up giving this

---------00:35----------
thing away on YouTube for free to a

---------00:38----------
member the audience so today we're gonna

---------00:40----------
be going over an 8 to 0 3437 mic

---------00:44----------
motherboard and this motherboard does

---------00:46----------
not turn on we do get a light in the

---------00:48----------
charger and we are going to be hunting

---------00:50----------
some liquid damage as you can see over

---------00:52----------
here we do get a light in the charger

---------00:54----------
and we are gonna turn the light back on

---------00:56----------
and we are gonna look through this board

---------00:58----------
to see if we can find where the liquid

---------01:00----------
is so can you find it do you see it

---------01:06----------
first thing we got to do is make sure

---------01:07----------
the focus matches because for some

---------01:09----------
reason there is a little gremlin that

---------01:11----------
takes this and makes it out of focus

---------01:12----------
this thing does like to go out of focus

---------01:13----------
what I think happens is there's a

---------01:15----------
gremlin and I think that that gremlin

---------01:16----------
sneaks in after hours and make sure that

---------01:18----------
my microscope is out of focus all right

---------01:22----------
there we go

---------01:23----------
are we in focus we are in focus all

---------01:26----------
right we are zoomed out to 7 X 1 thing

---------01:29----------
that I like to bring up to all the

---------01:30----------
people that ask me about microscopes and

---------01:32----------
which one to buy and the zooming and all

---------01:34----------
that well that's on the SSD so that

---------01:36----------
doesn't really count you

---------01:38----------
it's a pube look it's a little pube say

---------01:42----------
hello to the little pube

---------01:44----------
it's a pube but that's growing in a

---------01:47----------
culture ooh

---------01:47----------
oh yeah and people say that Jagermeister

---------01:54----------
is the reason I'm gonna throw up while

---------01:56----------
I'm working

---------01:56----------
no anyway look there's another pube like

---------02:01----------
this was even moving back and forth in

---------02:02----------
the wind you guys see that look at that

---------02:05----------
little pube moving back and forth look

---------02:08----------
at it isn't it adorable just waving back

---------02:12----------
and forth in the wind alone

---------02:13----------
black pube and a sieve blonde and

---------02:17----------
brunette pubes anyway

---------02:20----------
as I say the reason that I like having I

---------02:24----------
don't care about superzoom is because

---------02:26----------
like you're not gonna find liquid damage

---------02:27----------
like this this is a pit this is this is

---------02:29----------
how this hurts you find it at a high

---------02:32----------
Magnificat at a lower magnification it's

---------02:34----------
like high up hey what do you know

---------02:36----------
look at this connector over here it has

---------02:39----------
liquid damage and we're gonna remove it

---------02:42----------
because it has liquid damage and I bet

---------02:45----------
that this is probably gonna work and

---------02:47----------
we're done so this is a good time to go

---------02:49----------
over what I believe a common

---------02:51----------
misconception is that people that people

---------02:53----------
get themselves into they Allah I'll find

---------02:56----------
a lot of people that they'll find liquid

---------02:58----------
on the board and one of these diagnostic

---------02:59----------
ports and they'll go oh well there's

---------03:01----------
liquid here but that doesn't matter the

---------03:03----------
liquid in that port doesn't matter

---------03:05----------
that's not important and the reason that

---------03:07----------
is BS is because this little port over

---------03:09----------
here is literally for everything so over

---------03:13----------
here we have okay we have BIOS so we

---------03:17----------
have let's the SPI we have a bunch of

---------03:18----------
SPI stuff we have SMC mod so this is

---------03:23----------
gonna set the SMC mode we have SMC reset

---------03:25----------
L which is going to select whether the

---------03:27----------
SMC turns on we have programming lines

---------03:30----------
for the SMC so right here we have a

---------03:33----------
direct line to the bios a direct line of

---------03:35----------
the SMC and also a five volt and a 3

---------03:38----------
volt power line and I'm pretty sure that

---------03:41----------
there's a ground on this connector as

---------03:42----------
well so pretty much every important part

---------03:44----------
of the Machine goes to this connector

---------03:46----------
BIOS SMC modes that to decide what mode

---------03:50----------
the SMC is gonna be in whether the SMC

---------03:52----------
will even turn on along with the 5 volt

---------03:54----------
a 3 volt power rail in ground if I

---------03:56----------
wanted to destroy this machine and I had

---------03:58----------
one drop of water and I had to choose

---------04:01----------
exactly where I put that one drop of

---------04:02----------
water to guarantee that I destroy the

---------04:04----------
Machine if this were a game show I would

---------04:06----------
drop it right on that connector but so

---------04:08----------
many people think that that connector is

---------04:09----------
not important

---------04:10----------
it doesn't matter and this is what kills

---------04:12----------
me so here's what we're gonna see if

---------04:14----------
this microphone is better than the

---------04:15----------
others by the way noise reduction when I

---------04:16----------
have a bunch of stuff on this is a

---------04:18----------
cardioid microphone and the whole idea

---------04:19----------
with a cardioid microphone is that it

---------04:21----------
blocks out noise from external sources I

---------04:23----------
will say that the shore s I'm 35 while

---------04:25----------
it sounded like

---------04:27----------
it did sound like it was better at

---------04:29----------
blocking out noise from the air filter

---------04:30----------
because it was cardioid one thing that I

---------04:32----------
was particularly surprised that when it

---------04:33----------
came to this microphone is that it

---------04:35----------
actually seemed worse at blocking out

---------04:37----------
noise from the air filter and other

---------04:39----------
sources than the 4065 and the reason I

---------04:41----------
thought this was silly is because the

---------04:43----------
DPA 4065 is omnidirectional whereas the

---------04:46----------
DPA define 88 is cardioid and I think

---------04:49----------
that's because it's so difficult to

---------04:50----------
actually figure out where to even point

---------04:52----------
this thing I'm gonna I'm gonna show you

---------04:55----------
that at the end of the video because I

---------04:56----------
don't want to ruin the sound right now

---------04:57----------
I'm not kidding this doesn't even have a

---------04:59----------
mark on it to tell you which end is the

---------05:01----------
end that you talk into like you can't

---------05:03----------
make this up it doesn't you don't

---------05:06----------
even know which end is the end that

---------05:07----------
you're supposed to be talking into

---------05:08----------
because the end that you talk into and

---------05:10----------
the end that reject sound on the DPA

---------05:12----------
define 88 that I received have the exact

---------05:15----------
same marking on it I mean you know if

---------05:17----------
it's a $50 microphone and I can't

---------05:20----------
but this thing's like six 500

---------05:22----------
bucks like anyway so we're gonna get rid

---------05:27----------
of all the liquid stuff here all the now

---------05:31----------
what I'm what I'm doing here is I'm

---------05:32----------
gonna keep track of the pads that look a

---------05:34----------
little screwed up because if it still

---------05:35----------
doesn't turn on that tells me where I

---------05:37----------
should be looking good so this over here

---------05:41----------
the second one on the top little

---------05:45----------
disappeared little burned out and over

---------05:47----------
here this one over here is burned

---------05:50----------
actually this is the first one the top

---------05:51----------
that doesn't count cause it's ground and

---------05:52----------
this one over here so the fifth one on

---------05:55----------
the bottom which you can't see unless I

---------05:57----------
do this here we go

---------05:58----------
this one over here it's totally missing

---------05:59----------
so if this doesn't turn on I'm going to

---------06:02----------
look over those sections and that's

---------06:03----------
where I'm going to continue my

---------06:04----------
troubleshooting from but if it does turn

---------06:07----------
on and it will be beautiful if it did oh

---------06:11----------
but it doesn't okay so yeah we actually

---------06:14----------
do have to do a little bit of thinking

---------06:16----------
here lame all right so let's see what

---------06:19----------
those connections are for so the first

---------06:21----------
one the top is gonna be pp 3 V 4 2 so

---------06:24----------
that means that there was ripple on pp 3

---------06:26----------
V 4 2 and then the next one is going to

---------06:30----------
be its v on the bottom so 1 2 3 4 ok so

---------06:36----------
p.m. clock run L had some corrosion on

---------06:39----------
it

---------06:40----------
and PP 3v4 - so let's think to ourselves

---------06:45----------
here PP 3 before - had corrosion so if

---------06:48----------
let's see where these items go

---------06:50----------
so p.m. clock run L p.m. clock run L

---------06:57----------
where do you go it might as well look it

---------06:59----------
up in here p.m. clock run underscore ell

---------07:03----------
p.m. clock run L okay that's a that is a

---------07:08----------
pull-up resistor for that signal Oh

---------07:10----------
lame PCH power management ah that is not

---------07:16----------
making me feel good math that okay

---------07:20----------
that's a way for the PCH to community

---------07:22----------
that's a way to communicate with the PCH

---------07:24----------
because it doesn't go to anything else

---------07:25----------
this is a pull-up resistor that will

---------07:26----------
pull up that signal and that's Adam is

---------07:30----------
that this is bi-directional so I'm

---------07:32----------
assuming it's some sort of data line but

---------07:34----------
that's a data line for it to communicate

---------07:35----------
with something outside the machine I

---------07:37----------
can't imagine how that would be

---------07:38----------
important now if that did get a hit of

---------07:40----------
16 or 12 or 5 volts that's not gonna be

---------07:43----------
a good thing for us because if it got

---------07:46----------
ahead of that then that means the PCH

---------07:48----------
got killed and I really hope the PCH

---------07:50----------
didn't get killed because if it did that

---------07:52----------
means that this entire thing is a waste

---------07:53----------
of time

---------07:54----------
now let's see what is Oh see if I get

---------08:03----------
any voltage at that point on the board

---------08:11----------
and I get nothing so that is interesting

---------08:14----------
that I get nothing over there

---------08:15----------
so that is being pulled down so clock

---------08:18----------
run low okay where is that resistor that

---------08:24----------
it's supposed to show up on that yeah

---------08:26----------
let's move this around so it makes sense

---------08:28----------
so p.m. clock run L is getting pulled up

---------08:32----------
by this resistor that is in the middle

---------08:36----------
and nowhere but that that gets pulled up

---------08:38----------
in the machine is in an Esso state we're

---------08:41----------
not in an Esso state so that's not

---------08:42----------
supposed to get pulled up yet all right

---------08:44----------
so we're going to move on to the rest so

---------08:47----------
what could P P 3 V 4 2 became corroded

---------08:50----------
PP 3 V 4 - at a shock now we're just

---------08:53----------
going to look for all the things that

---------08:54----------
could have been corroded along pp 3

---------08:56----------
before - and see if we find anything

---------08:59----------
that is nasty

---------09:10----------
let's see this is a long pp3 before - so

---------09:13----------
let's see what we over here do we have

---------09:16----------
something that looks healthy over here

---------09:17----------
oh you have to chase using the hints

---------09:21----------
that you have Oh

---------09:24----------
plug it back in what do you know

---------09:40----------
corrosion by the clock area well that's

---------09:45----------
a good hint now do keep in mind that the

---------09:48----------
clock chip is actually powered by PP 3 V

---------09:50----------
4 - which had ripple on it

---------10:01----------
so that doesn't yeah all right so let's

---------10:04----------
clean up this area just a little bit

---------10:06----------
just in case that corrosion is doing

---------10:07----------
something to our circuit get the air

---------10:11----------
filter back on and let's do a little bit

---------10:16----------
of preliminary cleaning yeah shouldn't

---------10:21----------
they got that on the crystal this chip

---------10:24----------
doesn't look great to me something

---------10:28----------
strikes me as funny about that chip

---------10:32----------
I'm not going to trust it

---------10:37----------
we did get water over there and it's

---------10:39----------
very easy for that chip to die as a

---------10:40----------
result of water so it's got to go now

---------10:46----------
we're gonna try to find a board that

---------10:47----------
doesn't have water on it to take that

---------10:49----------
chip from well I seem to have stolen it

---------10:53----------
from everything in my pile great now

---------10:57----------
here's one okay this okay so first thing

---------11:00----------
we got to do is take that thing off the

---------11:02----------
board

---------11:07----------
this is along the pp 3 before to line

---------11:10----------
and it had water around it so I am

---------11:14----------
satisfied that I have enough evidence

---------11:18----------
that support said this can be bad and it

---------11:28----------
flew

---------11:35----------
yes beep hako beep

---------11:38----------
hopefully the cardioid microphone is

---------11:40----------
blocking out its beeping we'll see we

---------11:46----------
will see keep in mind this microphone

---------11:49----------
should perform better than the other one

---------11:51----------
for the specific tasks I have because

---------11:52----------
I'm asking it to not but to a not pick

---------11:57----------
up noise when noise is all around it and

---------12:00----------
it's right next to my face for all the

---------12:02----------
things that the SM 35 failed that that

---------12:04----------
microphone was a cheap piece of crap the

---------12:07----------
one thing that it did better than the

---------12:08----------
DPA 4065 isolating no one getting rid of

---------12:12----------
the noise getting rid of the air filter

---------12:14----------
and all that may have sounded like a

---------12:15----------
piece of sound like I was

---------12:17----------
underwater you had to apply like a

---------12:19----------
high-pass filter at the 180 Hertz in

---------12:21----------
order for you to not sound like you were

---------12:22----------
underwater but it did do that right so

---------12:26----------
if this cardioid microphone at its prize

---------12:28----------
can't do that ride then they can get the

---------12:30----------
eff up out here that being said let's

---------12:36----------
get a clock chip I'm grabbing a clock

---------12:40----------
chip right next door

---------12:59----------
right

---------13:10----------
this is one powerful station

---------13:16----------
okay now we're just gonna get rid of

---------13:18----------
that solder blob on the side clean it up

---------13:21----------
make it look a little nice work a little

---------13:23----------
nice and see if we have a working board

---------13:29----------
get that

---------14:13----------
I have to put down

---------14:35----------
the best time to do the cleaning a

---------14:37----------
little bit of preliminary cleaning as

---------14:39----------
well it's still hot it'll help the

---------14:40----------
ultrasonic later then we'll Tristana

---------14:43----------
clean it is a good job but if you get

---------14:45----------
rid of them really nasty stuff while

---------14:47----------
it's still hot it helps everything out

---------14:50----------
helps everything along okay so we turn

---------14:53----------
on the charger on hand it's still dead

---------14:59----------
well great

---------15:00----------
okay so now we're just kind of flying

---------15:03----------
blind since all of our hints huh

---------15:09----------
what's you what bu this is for s Oh

---------15:15----------
power good circuitry that's for getting

---------15:17----------
it into an S this is for getting into an

---------15:20----------
S Oh state or sending all power good we

---------15:22----------
are so far from that that doesn't that's

---------15:25----------
irrelevant at this point

---------15:39----------
clearly was some dirt they got in this

---------15:41----------
area you can see all that red

---------15:44----------
coming off

---------15:59----------
I broke that trace Bishop even though it

---------16:04----------
was scraping it shouldn't I broke that

---------16:05----------
easily okay yeah that it didn't I I may

---------16:10----------
have ripped that off but it don't look

---------16:13----------
like it was exhibit was on there that's

---------16:15----------
secure to begin with anyway

---------16:18----------
good riddance to up let's

---------16:21----------
just take that off draw myself a wire

---------16:28----------
come on no patience go get outta here

---------16:35----------
yeah daddy all right good you're gone

---------16:41----------
now

---------17:26----------
not the nicest wire in the world but

---------17:28----------
this is not what I'm good at anyway so

---------17:32----------
come on these trees were stuck

---------17:44----------
yeah there we go

---------17:50----------
now let's get that component from

---------17:52----------
something

---------18:09----------
this mic is such a like as

---------18:13----------
the the wire moves at all the mic moves

---------18:16----------
and you may be thinking Louis get a clip

---------18:18----------
you get the clip but still even if you

---------18:20----------
clip it to your shirt if you move your

---------18:21----------
head between the clip and the microphone

---------18:24----------
that length of why I will have to

---------18:25----------
capability to move you genuinely have to

---------18:29----------
tape this thing near face written on

---------18:31----------
move I've just I've never been so

---------18:34----------
disappointed with anything made by DPA I

---------18:40----------
couldn't be an idiot that doesn't know

---------18:42----------
how to wear a microphone but still

---------18:52----------
that could not be on more jacket that

---------18:57----------
could not be more jagged man and you

---------19:03----------
know what and somebody else walks in

---------19:06----------
great that was a crybaby I told somebody

---------19:12----------
that we don't fix the iPhone six-plus

---------19:14----------
screen their best bet is Apple he just

---------19:16----------
stared at me for like 20 seconds before

---------19:18----------
going I don't know how you can do that

---------19:23----------
in front of your girlfriend I would

---------19:28----------
prefer to not show my girlfriend that

---------19:30----------
I'm a two-year-old but maybe I'm maybe

---------19:36----------
their thing again I am single so what

---------19:37----------
the do I know anyway but this type

---------19:41----------
of soldering where the hell is ever

---------19:42----------
gonna go out with me I will never get a

---------19:45----------
date as long as my soldering is this bad

---------19:47----------
as long as everything I put on is

---------19:48----------
crooked all right do I

---------20:05----------
and another person walked in and the

---------20:08----------
fans fun though we'll celebrate the fan

---------20:10----------
spinning Wow somebody asked me about a

---------20:13----------
while you wait data recovery I gave them

---------20:15----------
drive savers information you know what I

---------20:18----------
deserve in a drive savers affiliate

---------20:20----------
account

---------20:21----------
I refer so many people to drive savers I

---------20:23----------
refer a lot of people to drive savers

---------20:25----------
these days I mean you know like five

---------20:27----------
when they say oh three or four hundred

---------20:29----------
for phone data recovery here may want to

---------20:32----------
try these guys they're a little cheaper

---------20:34----------
I love doing that I love doing that like

---------20:37----------
I know it's mean but I just love doing

---------20:38----------
it people like you know I can't wait

---------20:40----------
three days for this or five days for

---------20:42----------
this all right try these guys wait till

---------20:46----------
they hear twenty four hundred bucks and

---------20:48----------
we get it when we get it anyway as you

---------20:50----------
can see here the fan is spinning which

---------20:55----------
is the end-all-be-all way of telling

---------20:57----------
that this is a working device so all we

---------21:01----------
did is we just follow the liquid damage

---------21:03----------
and let's just go over the piece that

---------21:06----------
was keeping this from turning on it

---------21:09----------
wasn't even a lot of measuring going on

---------21:10----------
here so the piece that was keeping us

---------21:13----------
for his cue 8150 so let's look up cue

---------21:16----------
8150 this is used

---------21:21----------
okay so pp5 VSO is gonna go in there pp

---------21:25----------
3 v 3 s o is gonna go in there and PP 3

---------21:29----------
V 3 s 5 has to work so ultimately if

---------21:31----------
these rails are good and PP 1 v 5s o is

---------21:35----------
there then it will let out all system

---------21:38----------
power good but PP 3 V 3 s 5 is to be

---------21:41----------
present PP 5 vs o PP 3 V 3 s o and peep

---------21:44----------
you want to be 5 s o if each one of

---------21:46----------
these rails is present you will get all

---------21:48----------
system power good now we did have a

---------21:50----------
broken trace over here we did have a

---------21:52----------
very damaged and and rusted looking

---------21:54----------
trace between our 81 53

---------21:58----------
where is re we go from here to the base

---------22:03----------
of Q 2 which is transistor 2 inside Q

---------22:07----------
8150 so Q 8150 is a transistor multiple

---------22:09----------
transistor package that just has what

---------22:12----------
looks like think 1 MOSFET and 3 bipolar

---------22:16----------
Junction transistors is it

---------22:18----------
that inside of one package so all says

---------22:22----------
power good is probably low because the
