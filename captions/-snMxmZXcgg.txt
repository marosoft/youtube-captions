---------00:00----------
why does it clean corrosion because it

---------00:02----------
gets paid to clean corrosion

---------00:04----------
why does it put the lotion on its skin

---------00:07----------
so it doesn't get the hose again

---------00:09----------
come on man what are you a crackhead

---------00:13----------
what kind of question is that hey

---------00:14----------
everybody how's it going so today we're

---------00:15----------
going to be working on a macbook it's an

---------00:16----------
a1466 macbook air

---------00:18----------
we're going to do this macbook is the

---------00:20----------
same thing we do with every other

---------00:21----------
macbook on this channel pinky

---------00:23----------
try to take over the world what are the

---------00:25----------
problems that you notice with this

---------00:28----------
macbook

---------00:30----------
what is broken what is wrong no battery

---------00:33----------
not connected is fine because if it got

---------00:34----------
liquid damage which

---------00:36----------
looks like it did

---------00:42----------
right over there then you want

---------00:46----------
the battery to be unplugged what else do

---------00:48----------
you notice

---------00:50----------
red dot is red indeed it is liquid

---------00:51----------
damage wi-fi cable yes

---------00:54----------
these are not routed properly definitely

---------00:56----------
correct

---------00:57----------
that should be routed differently what

---------00:59----------
else do we have here what else is wrong

---------01:02----------
what do we notice so the wi-fi cables

---------01:04----------
are supposed to be

---------01:06----------
behind here like this my right speaker

---------01:09----------
is

---------01:11----------
under the board so yeah the right

---------01:14----------
speaker does not go under the board it

---------01:16----------
goes

---------01:16----------
it goes into the connector you can see

---------01:18----------
the cable is

---------01:19----------
stuck under there so that that sucks

---------01:28----------
and every one of these things must be

---------01:30----------
noticed because even if i fix their

---------01:32----------
current problem if i don't fix

---------01:34----------
if i fix the problem they brought it to

---------01:35----------
me for that's not good enough you need

---------01:37----------
to fix

---------01:38----------
everything so you need to note

---------01:39----------
everything that's wrong with it to make

---------01:40----------
sure that when you're giving it back to

---------01:41----------
the customer

---------01:42----------
you're not giving it back to them with

---------01:43----------
anything wrong with it whatsoever

---------01:46----------
so i'm going to attach

---------01:50----------
my power supply

---------01:55----------
put it on the screen and i might even

---------01:58----------
use the good old-fashioned paul daniels

---------02:00----------
multimeter software

---------02:03----------
all right so it looks like we get 200

---------02:05----------
milliamps but no but

---------02:07----------
no green actually here we have a green

---------02:08----------
light no fan spin 200 milliamps

---------02:11----------
usually that speaks to a short to ground

---------02:13----------
on our pp bus of g3 huh

---------02:16----------
let's see if that's the case here

---------02:19----------
usually that's what that is so one of

---------02:20----------
the things i like to do is i

---------02:22----------
power the computer off of a power supply

---------02:23----------
it's a bench power supply

---------02:25----------
rather than off of a traditional mag

---------02:26----------
save so on the other end of this is just

---------02:27----------
tying into a power supply that's putting

---------02:29----------
out 18 volts

---------02:30----------
because i want to see how much power the

---------02:31----------
board is taking because it's going to

---------02:33----------
give me a shortcut way to tell

---------02:36----------
exactly what is wrong with that

---------02:38----------
particular board and a lot of the times

---------02:40----------
when it's taking two to 250 milliamps

---------02:42----------
but dead

---------02:43----------
our pp brush is shorted and this is

---------02:45----------
supported here by the fact that

---------02:47----------
pv-bus g3 hot which is supposed to be

---------02:50----------
showing up on the screen using paul

---------02:51----------
daniels the software

---------02:52----------
um here we go it's three volts

---------02:57----------
instead of eight now a short would bring

---------03:00----------
us down to one volt or so

---------03:02----------
not one to three that's a little weird

---------03:05----------
so i'm going to take the board out of

---------03:06----------
the case and we're going to examine it

---------03:07----------
but

---------03:08----------
you see do you understand why it is that

---------03:10----------
i'm always

---------03:11----------
checking the amperage that the board is

---------03:12----------
taking before doing any work

---------03:15----------
it gives me a shortcut instead of having

---------03:16----------
to measure and check every single line

---------03:18----------
the last time that i had pp bus i mean

---------03:21----------
the last time i had

---------03:22----------
uh figured out my problem was ppg3 hot

---------03:24----------
was short at the ground

---------03:25----------
i correlated that in my head with the

---------03:27----------
fact that the board had been only taking

---------03:28----------
250 milliamps when i had that problem

---------03:30----------
which is why i

---------03:32----------
always keep in my head and eventually if

---------03:35----------
i have if i were a smart business owner

---------03:37----------
i'd write it down

---------03:40----------
when i have a specific amount of

---------03:43----------
amperage being taken

---------03:44----------
and i would tie that to the problem we

---------03:47----------
need to fix the macbook to the point

---------03:48----------
where it becomes a thinkpad says

---------03:50----------
mario that's not going to happen

---------03:57----------
keep the wrong screw in the wrong hole

---------03:58----------
so see how the fan is kind of moving

---------04:00----------
around like this

---------04:01----------
it's because the screw is not tightly

---------04:03----------
hitting the top of the fan and it's not

---------04:04----------
hitting the top of the fan because you

---------04:05----------
got the wrong screw in the wrong hole

---------04:08----------
wrong screw wrong screw long

---------04:26----------
screw

---------04:50----------
first thing we're going to do is on pp

---------04:52----------
bus g3 hot i'm going to show you where

---------04:55----------
why it is i'm checking that in a moment

---------04:56----------
i'm going to check and see if i got

---------04:58----------
myself a short to ground

---------05:00----------
and open up the board view for the

---------05:03----------
820-00165 which this board happens to be

---------05:07----------
we're going to hit the schematic in the

---------05:09----------
board view

---------05:10----------
i'm going to put it on the screen so

---------05:12----------
here's a list of power rails in the

---------05:14----------
machine

---------05:14----------
remember all the rails at g3 hot comes

---------05:16----------
first then s5

---------05:18----------
s4 s3 nso g3 hot always on

---------05:21----------
s5 on when the machine is off s4 on when

---------05:24----------
the machine is

---------05:25----------
hibernating s3 on the machine is

---------05:27----------
sleeping nso on when the machine is

---------05:29----------
actually on and working

---------05:30----------
i'm sorry i don't understand what that

---------05:31----------
means i appreciate the 4.99 and thank

---------05:33----------
you very much

---------05:35----------
but i don't know what that means so we

---------05:37----------
are going to go back to this

---------05:39----------
let's check up on people g3hot which i

---------05:41----------
could find right over here

---------05:43----------
see if it showed at the ground

---------05:49----------
1.2 what do you know shorter the ground

---------05:53----------
now we can search around the board and

---------05:55----------
see if uh

---------05:56----------
something sticks out to us as a pb bus

---------05:59----------
short

---------06:02----------
maybe it will maybe it won't one way to

---------06:04----------
find out folks

---------06:07----------
one way to find out in a moment i'm

---------06:10----------
going to turn the microscope camera on

---------06:12----------
i keep forgetting that to get paul to

---------06:14----------
fix the buttons on my camera

---------06:16----------
i'm pretty sure he could figure it out

---------06:17----------
he's a smart guy he figures out all the

---------06:19----------
stuff that i wind up breaking and i bet

---------06:21----------
he'd help me figure this out but i

---------06:22----------
always forget the moment the stream is

---------06:23----------
done

---------06:25----------
maybe high high can remind me can you

---------06:27----------
guys email hi hi

---------06:29----------
rosman group.com and ask him when i'm

---------06:31----------
done streaming to give my microscope

---------06:32----------
camera to paul

---------06:33----------
to see if he can get the buttons to work

---------06:35----------
that's hi hi

---------06:36----------
h-i-h-i at rossmanngroup.com two s's and

---------06:40----------
two ends

---------06:42----------
don't delay spam high high today

---------06:45----------
spam hi hi like he's cheap canned meat

---------06:51----------
okay get the light on

---------06:54----------
yeah it'll be nice once i can get white

---------06:56----------
balance and all that back

---------07:17----------
yesterday's e-bike display stream

---------07:28----------
huh i still don't get it i'm sorry

---------07:32----------
so turn to the audience to your personal

---------07:34----------
assistants to have the other assistant

---------07:36----------
do work

---------07:38----------
you're starting to understand the way

---------07:39----------
this company works now man

---------07:42----------
all right so these caps near the cpu are

---------07:44----------
usually it

---------07:45----------
not it

---------07:51----------
there's some green on this transistor

---------07:55----------
but that's not it

---------08:05----------
corrosion around the capacitor but it

---------08:06----------
doesn't look blown up

---------08:11----------
green there's actually more damage to

---------08:15----------
the pp3v42 area i would expect this to

---------08:18----------
not be working

---------08:20----------
sensor area

---------08:23----------
thunderbolt chip well we have a couple

---------08:26----------
of different candidates

---------08:28----------
so what i like to do when i have a

---------08:29----------
couple of different candidates for what

---------08:31----------
it could be

---------08:32----------
is run some voltage to the board and see

---------08:34----------
what gets hot

---------08:36----------
first i'd like to just redo some of that

---------08:39----------
nasty pp3v42 underscore g3 hot area over

---------08:42----------
here

---------08:43----------
that's seen better days

---------08:46----------
and nothing crazy nothing crazy you know

---------08:48----------
just a little bit of

---------08:49----------
a little bit of flux a little bit of hot

---------08:51----------
air

---------08:53----------
and it'll be good you know yeah

---------08:56----------
no big deal

---------09:00----------
all right so i just want to use a little

---------09:02----------
bit of

---------09:03----------
hot air not too much

---------09:06----------
just to make sure that i reflow this

---------09:08----------
stuff and get rid of the corrosion

---------09:32----------
why the short on the wire this red wire

---------09:35----------
disappeared after you disconnected

---------09:36----------
the display

---------09:40----------
[Music]

---------09:41----------
oh so the display was always shorted

---------09:43----------
okay now i get it

---------09:50----------
did i check for the short before or

---------09:52----------
after disconnecting the display though

---------09:53----------
kind of curious

---------09:56----------
did i check it before and after just

---------09:58----------
getting the display off

---------09:59----------
or did i check it only after the wiring

---------10:01----------
harness was off

---------10:03----------
either way that display is in a better

---------10:05----------
place now

---------10:07----------
that place is in that display is now

---------10:10----------
safely thrown away into any waste

---------10:12----------
container where it belongs

---------10:18----------
that video had eli view numbers

---------10:22----------
last i looked it had like 3 000 views in

---------10:25----------
a channel with 1 million people and i

---------10:26----------
get it

---------10:27----------
it's boring it's not the most

---------10:29----------
interesting thing but like holy [ __ ]

---------10:31----------
one million subscribers my balls

---------10:34----------
my balls

---------10:38----------
you gonna convince me that that's not

---------10:40----------
like google

---------10:41----------
hyping their numbers up in some way by

---------10:43----------
getting bots to subscribe

---------10:45----------
no that's some

---------10:53----------
i don't know what it is

---------10:57----------
all right

---------11:00----------
every place we see a little green i want

---------11:14----------
to make sure this

---------11:15----------
solder connections were not [ __ ] up

---------11:18----------
anywhere where i got a little bit of

---------11:20----------
green

---------11:25----------
you know work on bike after that i added

---------11:28----------
a 10 ohm resistor

---------11:29----------
and the in line with the fuse as well

---------11:33----------
to for the screen so i'm hoping that

---------11:34----------
it's gonna if it's gonna

---------11:38----------
cut off the potential for like some of

---------11:40----------
the overages

---------11:44----------
so i've been i started messing with the

---------11:45----------
kp and ki settings again

---------11:48----------
i have not heard back from grin but

---------11:51----------
they're probably just thinking to

---------11:52----------
themselves

---------11:53----------
at this point what the [ __ ] is this guy

---------11:56----------
doing with our stuff

---------11:58----------
go away i don't know someone if someone

---------12:01----------
started asking me

---------12:03----------
do you have a poly fuse on the input or

---------12:04----------
output of x device that you sold me

---------12:07----------
i think the first thing that i would

---------12:08----------
tell kevin to do is say like just tell

---------12:10----------
them

---------12:11----------
they just make them stop make them stop

---------12:16----------
make it stop

---------12:20----------
you're asking questions at that point

---------12:22----------
that qualify you as a pain in the ass

---------12:24----------
customer

---------12:28----------
like i'm asking them questions that make

---------12:30----------
me a pain in the ass customer

---------12:36----------
poor foregrin

---------12:42----------
my other controllers appear to have come

---------12:44----------
back but before

---------12:45----------
the input and the output had zero like

---------12:49----------
.5 ohms of resistance and today none of

---------12:51----------
them do so i kind of want to see if they

---------12:53----------
if those

---------12:54----------
magically recovered speaking of recovery

---------12:56----------
no recovery will happen for this jtag

---------12:58----------
connector

---------13:04----------
die

---------13:06----------
i want you to die

---------13:09----------
die like a cycle analyst when i'm

---------13:11----------
changing my kp and ki settings

---------13:14----------
without a resistor or fuse in line

---------13:17----------
between

---------13:18----------
voltage out of my controller and my

---------13:21----------
screen

---------13:22----------
die

---------13:31----------
filthy jtag connector

---------13:34----------
get the [ __ ] out of here

---------13:43----------
so i've been writing company standards i

---------13:45----------
wanted to take all the company standards

---------13:47----------
and really like beef them up

---------13:48----------
but also so one of the things that i've

---------13:50----------
wanted to do and you guys please let me

---------13:52----------
know if you think that

---------13:53----------
if you have input or anything that you'd

---------13:55----------
be able to contribute

---------13:57----------
if you have someone to contribute please

---------13:58----------
email hi hi rossmangroup.com

---------14:01----------
so i've kind of been playing with this

---------14:03----------
idea of an industry trade association

---------14:06----------
that's going to do three different

---------14:07----------
things first it is going to support

---------14:10----------
people who create educational materials

---------14:13----------
like real educational materials stuff

---------14:14----------
that where once you learn it

---------14:16----------
you can active you can immediately turn

---------14:18----------
around and then offer services to

---------14:20----------
customers using that that allows you to

---------14:22----------
make money

---------14:23----------
i want to offer that and i want to make

---------14:25----------
it available for free

---------14:26----------
to people in the industry you know the

---------14:30----------
second thing i want to do

---------14:31----------
is advocacy let people know outside of

---------14:35----------
you know the

---------14:35----------
the text section of reddit that right to

---------14:37----------
repair is an issue you know normal

---------14:38----------
people

---------14:40----------
and the third thing would be the helping

---------14:43----------
teach people how to

---------14:44----------
lobby themselves so not really like

---------14:46----------
hiring charlie brown like lobbyists but

---------14:48----------
rather

---------14:48----------
teaching people how to advocate and deal

---------14:51----------
with their own politicians and

---------14:52----------
not on on them to death and not be

---------14:54----------
scared showing up it

---------14:56----------
because you know if you got a politician

---------14:57----------
that's had like 72 or 200 of their

---------14:59----------
constituents show up

---------15:00----------
you know one after the other after the

---------15:02----------
other then when you go to a hearing it

---------15:03----------
may be slightly different

---------15:06----------
and one of the things that i hear a lot

---------15:08----------
from

---------15:09----------
from the opposition politicians

---------15:12----------
is that there's no standards in this

---------15:14----------
industry they have no standards they're

---------15:16----------
not certified

---------15:18----------
well a lot of people have been saying

---------15:19----------
you know i should create a rosman

---------15:21----------
certification they'd take a rossman

---------15:22----------
certification over some eight plus ship

---------15:24----------
but to have a certification it means

---------15:26----------
that you're certifying someone to a

---------15:27----------
specific standard

---------15:30----------
so you can't have a certification before

---------15:32----------
you have standards

---------15:33----------
and i'd like to create i'd like to kind

---------15:36----------
of have a board of people that are

---------15:38----------
you know respected and experienced and

---------15:40----------
successful in the industry

---------15:42----------
work a lot you know like work with me to

---------15:44----------
develop

---------15:45----------
standards and we're going to start

---------15:46----------
really really basic at first with

---------15:48----------
conduct basics of having a repair shop

---------15:51----------
and then like later on we'll focus on a

---------15:53----------
specific device repairs or you know

---------15:56----------
here's how you know don't be stuff like

---------16:00----------
when fixing an a13 69 screen if you're

---------16:03----------
doing lcd cell only

---------16:05----------
without display assembly wear gloves so

---------16:07----------
you don't get

---------16:08----------
fingerprints and marks on the or oils on

---------16:11----------
the backlight diffuser layer you know

---------16:12----------
basic

---------16:13----------
stuff like that or every item in shop

---------16:16----------
must have an address so that you know

---------16:18----------
where it is in your shop at all times if

---------16:21----------
you separate

---------16:22----------
the ssd from the machine put a label on

---------16:24----------
it so it doesn't go like you know basic

---------16:25----------
[ __ ] like that i want to actually create

---------16:26----------
that

---------16:28----------
so that you we can say that we have a

---------16:31----------
set of standards

---------16:32----------
that actually mean something because

---------16:34----------
i've been reading about this wise

---------16:36----------
certification

---------16:37----------
and like ctia is trying to do the same

---------16:39----------
[ __ ] but they don't have any buy-in from

---------16:40----------
the industry nobody likes ctia they

---------16:42----------
lobby against right to repair they're

---------16:43----------
not repair people themselves they're

---------16:45----------
they have no idea what the [ __ ] they're

---------16:47----------
doing in my opinion they don't have

---------16:48----------
authority in the industry nobody is

---------16:50----------
really like oh my god

---------16:51----------
i'm ctia certified this is amazing no

---------16:54----------
nobody's really bragging about that but

---------16:56----------
i think if the people who are the best

---------16:57----------
in this industry could come up with

---------16:58----------
something

---------16:59----------
maybe it's something that could actually

---------17:01----------
be made to work

---------17:04----------
you know if the people that are actually

---------17:06----------
people do want to have businesses that

---------17:08----------
are similar to theirs or people who are

---------17:10----------
in their shoes making the certification

---------17:12----------
but you need standards

---------17:13----------
first and i would like to if possible

---------17:17----------
get input from as many people as there

---------17:20----------
are

---------17:20----------
and do this in some sort of open way

---------17:22----------
where i'm taking in as much information

---------17:24----------
as i can from others

---------17:25----------
the issue is that there are many people

---------17:27----------
out there who are going to think to

---------17:28----------
themselves

---------17:29----------
wait a second standards are a part of my

---------17:31----------
business why am i going to give you what

---------17:33----------
i spend time developing

---------17:34----------
but at the same time i think that it

---------17:36----------
would be good for the industry

---------17:38----------
if we could say listen we have a set of

---------17:40----------
standards here's some

---------17:41----------
basic agreements so it's not you need to

---------17:43----------
use a dymo label versus a piece of

---------17:45----------
artist tape to label the ssd if you

---------17:46----------
separate it from the computer

---------17:48----------
just the basic [ __ ] like label this so

---------17:49----------
that you don't lose the customer's data

---------17:52----------
some some basic

---------17:55----------
good faith stuff like that and i'd like

---------17:58----------
to get input from the community

---------17:59----------
and eventually once it's all done i'd

---------18:01----------
like to be able to post it into some

---------18:02----------
sort of wiki

---------18:04----------
and not allow everybody to edit it i

---------18:06----------
don't want to do that but what i want to

---------18:07----------
do is allow everybody to submit

---------18:09----------
potential changes that then a group of

---------18:12----------
people then go over and debate amongst

---------18:14----------
themselves

---------18:15----------
who are considered you know

---------18:16----------
authoritative in the industry that this

---------18:18----------
is worth it

---------18:26----------
and i actually don't want to restrict

---------18:28----------
the content when people join the

---------18:30----------
association

---------18:31----------
i actually want it to be the opposite i

---------18:32----------
want every single customer

---------18:34----------
potential customer of our business to be

---------18:36----------
able to view these so if we have a

---------18:38----------
standard like you know the machine must

---------18:40----------
leave the store with everything it came

---------18:41----------
with

---------18:42----------
every machine that comes in should be

---------18:43----------
cleaned

---------18:45----------
before and after so that like it should

---------18:48----------
nobody should think to themselves it's

---------18:49----------
not my job to clean it

---------18:50----------
the person should get it back cleaner

---------18:52----------
than it was basic [ __ ] like that

---------18:54----------
if you're doing a water damage repair

---------18:57----------
and you see that there's an item

---------18:59----------
like let's say over here technically

---------19:00----------
this circuit worked but it had corrosion

---------19:02----------
on it

---------19:03----------
don't leave it like that don't only fix

---------19:05----------
the problem that's keeping it from

---------19:06----------
turning on

---------19:07----------
fix everything that's going to keep

---------19:08----------
that's going to cause this thing to

---------19:09----------
potentially come back

---------19:10----------
within the warranty period and outside

---------19:12----------
the warranty period i think if consumers

---------19:14----------
had the ability to read this list of

---------19:16----------
standards and understand that we

---------19:18----------
take this seriously as an industry that

---------19:20----------
they would feel a little bit

---------19:21----------
less stressed out about going to an

---------19:23----------
independent repair shop

---------19:24----------
and this is something that's go that i'd

---------19:26----------
like to actually do full time and i am

---------19:28----------
putting in

---------19:29----------
a bit of work to establish this

---------19:32----------
get myself to a point where i can

---------19:34----------
establish this is my full-time job so

---------19:36----------
rather than my full-time job

---------19:38----------
being doing you know working at my

---------19:41----------
business and building my business or

---------19:42----------
just making videos for my business like

---------19:44----------
this stuff

---------19:45----------
my full-time job would then become at

---------19:49----------
running a trade association that

---------19:52----------
helps people in the business that

---------19:55----------
advocates for the good of the business

---------19:58----------
and that doesn't do this as a hobby it's

---------20:00----------
not something where i show up at a

---------20:01----------
hearing you know

---------20:03----------
once every year and a half or so and say

---------20:05----------
my piece to a politician and then go

---------20:07----------
home

---------20:07----------
something where my job is making sh is

---------20:10----------
coming up with ways to actually add real

---------20:13----------
value

---------20:14----------
not and i'm it's something i'm something

---------20:17----------
i'd like to

---------20:18----------
put some time and effort into i think it

---------20:20----------
would be

---------20:23----------
you know can i get certified to solder

---------20:28----------
with two ds yes you can

---------20:31----------
i'm gonna be evil because my banana clip

---------20:32----------
broke off and i'm going to solder

---------20:35----------
the ground wire over here i'm going to

---------20:38----------
do this before we set industry standards

---------20:39----------
though

---------20:41----------
i'll be grandfathered in

---------20:44----------
all right but this is something that i

---------20:48----------
think would be a really interesting way

---------20:49----------
to spend

---------20:50----------
my my 30s and i want to actually get

---------20:53----------
something done i wouldn't want this to

---------20:54----------
be this type of uh

---------20:56----------
you know what i'm talking about this

---------20:57----------
kind of [ __ ] philanthropy where

---------20:59----------
people pretend that we're providing

---------21:00----------
education or something when in reality

---------21:02----------
you're just updating a school's

---------21:03----------
textbooks from

---------21:04----------
1999 textbooks to 2000. it doesn't make

---------21:07----------
any sort of tangible difference

---------21:08----------
in the lives of the students but you

---------21:10----------
technically get to say that you provided

---------21:12----------
them with

---------21:12----------
updated textbooks through your

---------21:14----------
organization or foundation i want this

---------21:15----------
to be the type of thing

---------21:17----------
that actually creates real change in

---------21:19----------
people's lives that allows people

---------21:21----------
who started out the way i did instead of

---------21:24----------
having to

---------21:25----------
risk their own money their own finances

---------21:27----------
and their own sanity

---------21:28----------
figuring out how to do everything from

---------21:29----------
scratch where people who are good at

---------21:32----------
what they do

---------21:33----------
actually have an incentive structure to

---------21:34----------
produce content similar to me

---------21:36----------
because there'll be a means within which

---------21:38----------
to compensate them

---------21:39----------
because i produced all this [ __ ] that i

---------21:41----------
produced and how to do everything after

---------21:43----------
i figured it out and tortured myself for

---------21:45----------
years to figure it out

---------21:46----------
and also for free and i realize most

---------21:48----------
people are they're not going to enter an

---------21:50----------
industry where every single thing you

---------21:52----------
have to figure out on your own from

---------21:53----------
scratch

---------21:54----------
and if they do all that work of figuring

---------21:56----------
out from scratch they sure

---------21:58----------
should are not going to want to give it

---------21:59----------
away it is what it is and i've tried to

---------22:01----------
get people to realize that with business

---------22:03----------
models like mine i have given away

---------22:06----------
every single piece of information i've

---------22:07----------
learned on how to run a business how to

---------22:09----------
deal with every element of it it's

---------22:10----------
somewhere in this youtube channel

---------22:12----------
every little piece of how to run a

---------22:13----------
business or what makes us different sets

---------22:15----------
us apart or makes us special

---------22:17----------
is all out there already nothing is

---------22:20----------
being

---------22:21----------
you know held close to the best and the

---------22:23----------
business has not suffered

---------22:25----------
because of it but in spite like i get

---------22:29----------
that people are not going to do that i'd

---------22:30----------
like to actually have some sort of

---------22:31----------
proper professional framework

---------22:34----------
within which when i find people who are

---------22:35----------
providing good resources to the

---------22:36----------
community i can actually

---------22:39----------
make sure they continue doing that and i

---------22:41----------
want to keep it as technician focused as

---------22:42----------
possible

---------22:43----------
nothing offered here should be pretty

---------22:46----------
pretty

---------22:46----------
uh kind of fluff crap it needs to be

---------22:49----------
something that someone in the industry

---------22:50----------
would say wow that's actually useful to

---------22:52----------
me

---------22:56----------
but i think but to do something like

---------22:58----------
this there's going to be there's going

---------23:00----------
to be a requirement for a lot of buy-in

---------23:02----------
and by buying i don't mean money i mean

---------23:04----------
buy-in as in

---------23:05----------
people that are smarter than me that may

---------23:08----------
have something that i don't are willing

---------23:10----------
to contribute

---------23:11----------
their thoughts their time or resources

---------23:14----------
and by resources again i don't mean

---------23:16----------
money or items i mean

---------23:17----------
they're like let's say if we're making a

---------23:20----------
standards list and i want to look at

---------23:21----------
everything that everybody

---------23:23----------
i'd like to see the ideas that everybody

---------23:25----------
else has or what it is they've put

---------23:26----------
together for their own personal

---------23:28----------
businesses so that we can come up with a

---------23:29----------
framework of what works what doesn't

---------23:30----------
what's good what's bad

---------23:32----------
and really kind of

---------23:35----------
put something together that's not a joke

---------23:37----------
because when you look at the wise

---------23:38----------
certification and stuff like that i mean

---------23:39----------
that shit's a [ __ ] joke i mean there

---------23:42----------
was some line in there i don't remember

---------23:43----------
because it's been a while since jessa

---------23:44----------
showed it to me we were laughing on the

---------23:45----------
phone about it

---------23:46----------
it was by the way i'm injecting an amp

---------23:48----------
into the uh of one volt into the board

---------23:50----------
right now at 0.6 amps we're going to see

---------23:52----------
what gets warm in a moment

---------23:54----------
it says something like updating the

---------23:56----------
customer's phone when you do certain

---------23:57----------
repairs

---------24:00----------
never [ __ ] update the customer's

---------24:02----------
phone without their permission or

---------24:03----------
explicitly asking them if you want to do

---------24:05----------
it

---------24:06----------
and telling them there's a risk that

---------24:07----------
after i do this your phone dies

---------24:09----------
[ __ ] never do that that certification

---------24:11----------
is so

---------24:12----------
beyond [ __ ] stupid it makes me sick

---------24:16----------
and the people who wrote it most likely

---------24:17----------
have nothing to do with repair

---------24:19----------
and if i really really wanted to get

---------24:20----------
depressed those people who wrote that

---------24:22----------
certification and are responsible for

---------24:24----------
promoting it

---------24:24----------
likely all have more money right now

---------24:27----------
than i will make throughout the rest of

---------24:28----------
my natural life

---------24:30----------
life's not fair you know it was never

---------24:32----------
advertised as such but

---------24:34----------
i'd like to i'd like to start something

---------24:36----------
that is not a joke

---------24:38----------
where you know the input is actually

---------24:39----------
coming from the community so we don't

---------24:41----------
release something stupid like that

---------24:42----------
and i'm coming up with the

---------24:44----------
organizational framework to make this

---------24:45----------
happen

---------24:46----------
before i go ahead and fully finish

---------24:49----------
starting the organization because

---------24:50----------
starting an organization like this is

---------24:52----------
something that would take time

---------24:54----------
and since it's going to take time to

---------24:55----------
start it i figure i might as well hit

---------24:57----------
the ground running

---------24:58----------
with all the stuff that i know i'm going

---------25:00----------
to need later all right so we're going

---------25:01----------
to up this right now a little bit

---------25:03----------
i'm going to put my finger over here

---------25:05----------
nothing hot

---------25:07----------
put my finger over here when i yell ow

---------25:10----------
that means we've found the component

---------25:16----------
the police broke cameras in the other

---------25:17----------
room ow

---------25:19----------
ow ow

---------25:22----------
okay so i think it's right around here

---------25:25----------
the owl test always works this got to go

---------25:28----------
in the standards book

---------25:30----------
the owl test really does get

---------25:33----------
get the job done who's the joke most of

---------25:37----------
us are alas is vladimir

---------25:39----------
you guys are not the joke

---------25:43----------
okay is it the one on the right or the

---------25:44----------
one on the left

---------25:46----------
is it the one on the right or the one on

---------25:48----------
the left

---------25:49----------
they're both evaporating at the same

---------25:51----------
time you son of a [ __ ]

---------25:53----------
all right you know we're gonna do we're

---------25:54----------
gonna take both of them off at the same

---------25:55----------
time two caps at the same time baby

---------25:58----------
two caps at the same time

---------26:01----------
yeah the omfg that hertz test that's

---------26:04----------
definitely going to be in the

---------26:04----------
certification right there

---------26:12----------
coffee tip or whatever your poison is by

---------26:13----------
thank you i actually have a protein

---------26:15----------
shake next to me it is

---------26:17----------
coconut water banana and some protein

---------26:22----------
data

---------26:24----------
all right let's see which i'm going to

---------26:25----------
remove the cap let's see which one

---------26:28----------
gets rid of the short the left of the

---------26:30----------
i'm going to start with the left one

---------26:33----------
i think that may be a crack see that up

---------26:35----------
there that is a crack

---------26:37----------
that is a crack that is a crack

---------26:40----------
right there

---------26:44----------
see that crack crack in the corner of

---------26:47----------
the kappa sitter

---------26:49----------
die kappa sit or die die

---------26:52----------
capacitor die get off of the board

---------26:55----------
kappa sitter it's time for you to get

---------26:58----------
off of the board

---------26:59----------
kappa sitter wait a second

---------27:02----------
i have my iron set to 300 degrees the f

---------27:05----------
[ __ ]

---------27:07----------
god damn it of course you're not going

---------27:09----------
to come off the board

---------27:12----------
love listening streams all working

---------27:14----------
recently replaced my dell latitude

---------27:16----------
with the thinkpad l40 thoughts i think

---------27:19----------
that you replaced your computer

---------27:24----------
yeah sorry i'm probably more boring than

---------27:26----------
you expected

---------27:28----------
i don't know i haven't tried either of

---------27:30----------
those two machines so i really have

---------27:31----------
nothing to say on either

---------27:33----------
if anything you're the one who replaced

---------27:35----------
the computer so i should it's your

---------27:37----------
thoughts

---------27:39----------
i didn't replace my computer

---------27:43----------
i have no all right turn the power

---------27:46----------
supply off

---------27:47----------
you can see the short one away once we

---------27:49----------
did that

---------27:51----------
so i'm going to replace this capacitor

---------27:53----------
we're going to put the board to the

---------27:54----------
ultrasonic cleaner afterwards because

---------27:55----------
you never know there may be corrosion

---------27:56----------
hiding under something and that may be a

---------27:57----------
standard

---------27:58----------
another standard yes standards

---------28:14----------
but

---------28:16----------
i think this is going to be really

---------28:17----------
important because we are

---------28:19----------
one of the things about my business is

---------28:21----------
that i entered this business when i was

---------28:23----------
broke and destitute in a recession

---------28:25----------
economy and we are about to enter

---------28:26----------
something way worse in 2008

---------28:28----------
because we spent way worse than 2008 and

---------28:30----------
we'll leverage way more than 2008

---------28:32----------
so we're about to enter something way

---------28:34----------
worse than that and an industry that

---------28:36----------
allows people to start with nothing

---------28:38----------
and really make something of themselves

---------28:41----------
with a really low barrier to entry low

---------28:43----------
cost entry

---------28:44----------
this is going to be really important for

---------28:45----------
people to get back in and recover

---------28:48----------
and there is more stuff to be fixed out

---------28:50----------
there than you can ever imagine

---------28:51----------
particularly since people are not going

---------28:52----------
to be able to afford to buy new anymore

---------28:54----------
so this type of business being able to

---------28:56----------
thrive is going to be really important

---------28:58----------
and as time goes on we are taken less

---------29:00----------
seriously repair is taken less seriously

---------29:02----------
people are

---------29:04----------
you know the policies that many of the

---------29:05----------
companies have are becoming more and

---------29:07----------
more anti-repair

---------29:09----------
and there's really no one standing up

---------29:11----------
and pushing back against it full time

---------29:14----------
like full time getting people to

---------29:17----------
actually learn how to enter the business

---------29:19----------
full time making sure that we're

---------29:21----------
advocated for

---------29:22----------
as if

---------29:27----------
and i i think that i think i could put

---------29:30----------
together something that can make that

---------29:31----------
happen it's going to depend on whether

---------29:33----------
or not i have

---------29:34----------
earned the authority from the people

---------29:36----------
that are in the industry

---------29:38----------
to be able to get what it is i that i

---------29:41----------
need

---------29:42----------
when i need it have i earned the

---------29:43----------
authority because you don't get

---------29:45----------
authority because you have a million

---------29:46----------
subscribers

---------29:47----------
no one gives a [ __ ] about that

---------29:48----------
definitely nobody gives a [ __ ] about you

---------29:50----------
know having an organization or anything

---------29:52----------
you're an authority from people

---------29:55----------
by producing then after you produce

---------29:57----------
something

---------29:58----------
showing them how they can produce

---------29:59----------
something and then getting them to teach

---------30:01----------
other people how to produce something

---------30:03----------
like you have to keep going up like that

---------30:04----------
it's not like people in the industry are

---------30:06----------
just going to help me because

---------30:08----------
look i have a million subscribers or

---------30:10----------
look i have an organization like what

---------30:11----------
have you done for me

---------30:13----------
what have i done for you i got to earn

---------30:15----------
it and i guess i'm going to find out if

---------30:16----------
i've earned it from the

---------30:17----------
people in the industry when i decide to

---------30:20----------
start pursuing this and i

---------30:22----------
really hope that i get the opportunity

---------30:23----------
to work

---------30:25----------
to show that i can

---------30:28----------
that i can represent the industry well

---------30:31----------
and that the directions that i the

---------30:34----------
things i choose to focus on and

---------30:36----------
the help that i need is worth giving

---------30:40----------
i guess that's you know one of the fears

---------30:42----------
when you start anything

---------30:46----------
are you worth what you're asking for

---------30:55----------
i'm excited to start

---------31:00----------
over the past two or three weeks of the

---------31:02----------
business i've

---------31:03----------
taken a role of noting what other people

---------31:08----------
are doing the standards to which they're

---------31:09----------
doing it

---------31:10----------
without me actually doing any of it to

---------31:12----------
see how things would run

---------31:14----------
if i were not here and to see how things

---------31:17----------
would run

---------31:18----------
if i decided to let's say take on this

---------31:20----------
challenge of doing a trade association

---------31:22----------
as a full-time job

---------31:26----------
and so far

---------31:30----------
i've been really really above and beyond

---------31:33----------
humbled

---------31:34----------
and honored at the fact that the people

---------31:36----------
that i have doing their jobs here

---------31:38----------
do them so well that i'm really pretty

---------31:41----------
much obsolete

---------31:42----------
i would be i think i'd be necessary if i

---------31:43----------
wanted to

---------31:45----------
take the business forward to another

---------31:46----------
step i don't think that things would

---------31:48----------
continue moving

---------31:49----------
forward like you know way more efficient

---------31:51----------
ways of doing certain things or entering

---------31:53----------
certain

---------31:54----------
new services the same way but i think

---------31:56----------
that we've gotten pretty far as is

---------31:59----------
and the amount of additional work i

---------32:01----------
could put into my business i think would

---------32:03----------
lead diminishing returns

---------32:05----------
versus the returns that i could get for

---------32:07----------
the entire industry if i make this

---------32:10----------
my full-time job there's so many things

---------32:13----------
to do and so many places to

---------32:15----------
there's so much stuff to get done

---------32:16----------
there's so much ground that hasn't been

---------32:17----------
covered

---------32:26----------
and just reflowing the areas that had

---------32:28----------
little bits of

---------32:29----------
green on them

---------32:34----------
before don't let any green go unnoticed

---------32:37----------
on your board

---------32:45----------
we're going to check the other side and

---------32:46----------
make sure nothing is corroded on the

---------32:47----------
other side

---------32:51----------
then i'm going to plug it in and once i

---------32:53----------
see the fan spin

---------32:55----------
i will leave and never come back

---------32:59----------
ever again

---------33:09----------
that's probably flux from the other side

---------33:16----------
you'll never see me again

---------33:29----------
what are you one of our two brain dead

---------33:31----------
presidential candidates

---------33:33----------
what kind of question is that

---------33:41----------
oh yeah

---------34:04----------
it accepts charger dc in or else it gets

---------34:07----------
the hose again

---------34:13----------
oh power supply is still at two volts

---------34:23----------
[Music]

---------34:26----------
no oreo bad oreo

---------34:33----------
and we've got fan spin

---------34:37----------
that's it for today ladies and gentlemen

---------34:39----------
and as always i hope that you learned

---------34:41----------
something i'll see you all in the next

---------34:45----------
video bye now
