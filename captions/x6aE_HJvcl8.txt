---------00:00----------
all right so today I'm gonna go over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero 33:30 motherboard that was

---------00:04----------
having issues with the USB port the

---------00:05----------
client stated that they had no no USB

---------00:08----------
ports working so the first one and the

---------00:09----------
second one were both dead I tried it out

---------00:12----------
and I noticed that actually one of the

---------00:13----------
port's worked it was only one of them

---------00:14----------
that was dead

---------00:15----------
and I decided to go from there and try

---------00:18----------
to get a little an idea of what it was

---------00:19----------
that was going on now as you can

---------00:21----------
probably tell the microphone pop filter

---------00:23----------
that I'm using has gotten larger and

---------00:25----------
larger so as I said I just recently did

---------00:28----------
a video on why I use the DPA 4065 over

---------00:31----------
every other microphone on why I find it

---------00:32----------
to be one of the best literally the

---------00:34----------
video after I did that my DPA 4065 died

---------00:38----------
which brings me back to this piece of

---------00:40----------
crap which is the cheap short SM 35 it's

---------00:42----------
like $100 microphone you get what you

---------00:44----------
pay for it sounds like a piece of crap

---------00:46----------
and one of the problems with it is

---------00:48----------
plosives constant non-stop plus a like

---------00:51----------
if you if you breathe the wrong way this

---------00:53----------
microphone you need just just yeah it's

---------00:55----------
just garbage so what I did is I have a

---------00:58----------
shotgun microphone not the the Centaurs

---------01:00----------
of one I'm not going to touch the

---------01:01----------
Sennheiser one the one that civil lizard

---------01:03----------
guy I'm keeping that one because I'm

---------01:05----------
gonna use that for stuff but the little

---------01:06----------
shitty crappy garbage Sony microphone

---------01:09----------
that comes with the Sony camcorder has

---------01:10----------
is huge pop filter that's meant for a

---------01:13----------
shotgun microphone so I actually just

---------01:15----------
cut it with a set of scissors and I put

---------01:17----------
it over the pop filter that goes on here

---------01:19----------
all these little pop filters that you

---------01:21----------
get to go on the end of headset mics

---------01:22----------
they're meant to look nice but they

---------01:25----------
don't actually do much again especially

---------01:27----------
if your headset mic is a complete

---------01:28----------
steaming pile of like this sure SM

---------01:31----------
3/5 is so I yeah I don't give a if

---------01:34----------
I look silly I actually think it looks

---------01:35----------
kind of cool that it's completely

---------01:37----------
totally non proportional to anything

---------01:39----------
going on here so anyway let's say I've

---------01:41----------
already fixed this and I want to go over

---------01:43----------
a little bit of what's wrong because I

---------01:44----------
know that this is something that's going

---------01:45----------
to trick a lot of people so if you look

---------01:47----------
over in the in the USB area over here

---------01:50----------
you're gonna see that I've replaced a

---------01:52----------
couple of things under the microscope

---------01:54----------
you'll see some flux so yeah you see a

---------01:58----------
filter and you'll see another filter and

---------02:04----------
you'll see another filter and I want to

---------02:10----------
talk

---------02:10----------
about a couple of ideas because just

---------02:13----------
things that I know we're gonna get new

---------02:15----------
people so a lot of what I do when I'm

---------02:17----------
talking about with a what I'm doing to

---------02:19----------
fix these boards it's not really me

---------02:21----------
wanting you to do exactly what I did

---------02:23----------
because your problem is going to be

---------02:25----------
different than my problem so it doesn't

---------02:27----------
really make sense for you to take my

---------02:29----------
solution and apply it to your problem

---------02:31----------
because your problem was gonna be

---------02:32----------
different you may have no USB but when I

---------02:35----------
say that from problem I don't mean that

---------02:36----------
I have no USB and you have no USB I mean

---------02:38----------
that on mine you know the difference the

---------02:40----------
first differential payer has a bad

---------02:42----------
filter on the USB data line and on yours

---------02:44----------
the second high superspeed differential

---------02:46----------
pair has a bad filter on the data line

---------02:48----------
we're always gonna have something

---------02:49----------
different there's always gonna be

---------02:50----------
something different with my problem than

---------02:52----------
yours but what I want you to do is I

---------02:54----------
want you to pick up my mindset because

---------02:56----------
if you pick up my mindset you'll be able

---------02:58----------
to apply that mindset to all different

---------03:00----------
types of problems and you'll be able to

---------03:01----------
solve them on your own rather than be

---------03:03----------
forced to look on the internet for

---------03:04----------
somebody else to provide you with a

---------03:05----------
solution so one of the concepts I want

---------03:08----------
to get across in this video is that when

---------03:10----------
an inductor is used as a filter on a

---------03:12----------
data line to keep out you know Aaron is

---------03:15----------
noise that very often that filter is

---------03:18----------
gonna measure properly on a multimeter

---------03:20----------
and what I mean when I say a filter

---------03:22----------
let's just go over to the schematic here

---------03:24----------
on the PDF so that I can show you what

---------03:25----------
I'm talking about so this is the USB

---------03:27----------
port that wasn't working this is J 4700

---------03:30----------
now J 4700 over here is has so we have

---------03:34----------
the SuperSpeed stuff the SuperSpeed

---------03:36----------
stuff and then we have our basic

---------03:37----------
differential pair the standard crap that

---------03:40----------
gets used for USB so this over here is

---------03:43----------
for the USB 2 L 4700 you have these

---------03:46----------
diodes going to ground you have this

---------03:49----------
filter going between the first

---------03:50----------
differential pair which is the data line

---------03:51----------
for USB 2.0 and that is going to go to a

---------03:57----------
MUX chip and then that MUX chip over

---------04:00----------
here is going to go straight over to the

---------04:03----------
PCH and you really want to hope that

---------04:05----------
it's not the PCH because there's the PCH

---------04:07----------
it's it's not something that's going to

---------04:08----------
be worth doing you don't want to take a

---------04:10----------
board that fully works besides one USB

---------04:12----------
port and then replace a chip that you

---------04:14----------
can only get on ebay from knows who

---------04:17----------
replace that thing where there's a good

---------04:19----------
chance you could break the board

---------04:20----------
replacing it there's a very high chance

---------04:22----------
to chip you by is and then

---------04:24----------
have a dead board or a beeping board or

---------04:26----------
a board that turns off it doesn't do

---------04:27----------
anything for your customer so we don't

---------04:29----------
 with the PCH on boards that where

---------04:32----------
everything works we don't want to do

---------04:33----------
that that's that's not something that

---------04:34----------
you're gonna do you're not a PCH we we

---------04:37----------
replace or for hire that's a bad idea so

---------04:39----------
this is a filter this is another filter

---------04:42----------
then this is over here this is gonna be

---------04:44----------
for the SuperSpeed portion this is what

---------04:46----------
makes USB 3 USB 3 which is that extra

---------04:48----------
data line and this over here is going

---------04:51----------
directly to the PCH and then you have

---------04:53----------
another one more stuff for SuperSpeed

---------04:55----------
now here's the thing about the filter

---------04:57----------
here's the thing about the filter when

---------05:00----------
you go to measure this in resistance

---------05:01----------
mode on your multimeter say this is a

---------05:03----------
do-more 90 ohm whatever like that this

---------05:05----------
is the important part that a lot of

---------05:06----------
people are gonna get wrong it's gonna

---------05:07----------
it's gonna screw up a lot of people a

---------05:09----------
filter can be bad that filter cannot be

---------05:12----------
equipped or suited for USB 3

---------05:15----------
transmission or even USB 2 transmission

---------05:17----------
but on your multimeter it will measure

---------05:19----------
just fine do you know why I don't

---------05:21----------
measure finding your multimeter but not

---------05:23----------
provide usb on the board because your

---------05:25----------
multimeter is sending one boring ass

---------05:26----------
little signal just some boring flat

---------05:29----------
little voltage and then it's waiting for

---------05:31----------
that little boring flat voltage to come

---------05:33----------
back on the other end

---------05:34----------
whereas USB in USB 3 when you have 3 6

---------05:38----------
gigabit per second speeds going through

---------05:40----------
it I forget what USB 3 is if it's like 3

---------05:42----------
or 4 or 5 whether it's gigabit per

---------05:44----------
second transfer speeds that you have

---------05:45----------
going on there when you have that

---------05:46----------
gigabit per second speed going on you

---------05:49----------
have a lot of data moving back before

---------05:51----------
it's you have pulse no pulse pulse no

---------05:52----------
pulse pulse no possible and that filter

---------05:55----------
all the nice to do is get one of those

---------05:57----------
millions of pulses a second wrong and

---------05:59----------
you have no USB where as again the

---------06:02----------
multimeter all it's sending one static

---------06:04----------
pulse through and just hoping that it

---------06:06----------
gets it back on the other end that's

---------06:07----------
what the multimeters doing

---------06:08----------
but again what USB is doing is millions

---------06:10----------
of pulses per second and only one of

---------06:13----------
those pulses is to be up for this

---------06:16----------
to not work so even if the filter

---------06:18----------
measures perfectly fine on your

---------06:20----------
multimeter it could still actually not

---------06:22----------
work and cause you to have non-working

---------06:24----------
USB so your question at this point may

---------06:26----------
be well gee if I can't test it then what

---------06:28----------
do I do because a lot of people who come

---------06:31----------
to the the tutoring course here a lot of

---------06:32----------
people who also went to Jess's class a

---------06:34----------
lot of them one of the main questions is

---------06:36----------
you know how do we measure these

---------06:37----------
components

---------06:38----------
so we can fix these boards what are we

---------06:39----------
looking for how do we measure them and

---------06:41----------
the answers the end again the reason

---------06:43----------
that a lot of the times

---------06:44----------
answering these questions can be a

---------06:46----------
nightmare on the Internet especially

---------06:48----------
when people like you know or say things

---------06:49----------
like I will pay for you to answer this

---------06:51----------
one question the reason that's a

---------06:52----------
nightmare is because a lot of the times

---------06:54----------
I'm giving people answers that they

---------06:55----------
don't want so when somebody will say how

---------06:57----------
do I measure this inductor by USB I'll

---------06:59----------
say you replace it and you see if it

---------07:01----------
works and they don't like that answer

---------07:02----------
but the real answer is gonna be well you

---------07:05----------
buy a $40,000 spectrum analyzer and tone

---------07:08----------
generator and you read what comes out on

---------07:10----------
the other end but you don't like that

---------07:12----------
answer because that answer involves you

---------07:14----------
spending forty thousand dollars and then

---------07:16----------
the other answer is well you replace him

---------07:17----------
but you don't like that answer because

---------07:19----------
you don't have donor boards because you

---------07:20----------
don't have a pile like me where you can

---------07:22----------
just take another one of those filters

---------07:23----------
of the exact same specification rip it

---------07:25----------
off and put it on there you don't like

---------07:27----------
that I don't have the exact answer to

---------07:28----------
the question that you want but that is

---------07:30----------
the answer the practical way to measure

---------07:32----------
that filter is to replace it

---------07:34----------
the impractical but you know the proper

---------07:38----------
way to measure that fills room is that

---------07:40----------
$40,000 with the test equipment put a

---------07:42----------
bunch of little signals in see exactly

---------07:44----------
what comes out overlay them over one

---------07:46----------
another do some differential analysis

---------07:49----------
and you'll figure out what you get but

---------07:50----------
that's no you you get it you get a

---------07:53----------
 fifteen or thirty dollar donor

---------07:55----------
board you take off those little one cent

---------07:57----------
components from them you don't buy them

---------07:59----------
from Mouse or you don't buy them from

---------08:00----------
digi-key you don't wait one or two at

---------08:02----------
six weeks for it to come here because

---------08:03----------
your customer who had a perfectly

---------08:05----------
working computer besides one USB

---------08:07----------
port is going to rip you a new one if

---------08:09----------
they're waiting weeks on you to order

---------08:10----------
all this from mouse or to figure

---------08:11----------
out what's gone what's wrong what you do

---------08:13----------
is you replace them so I just started

---------08:16----------
over there so what the other thing that

---------08:18----------
I did here just to make sure that I

---------08:19----------
wasn't getting myself into a rabbit hole

---------08:21----------
to hell is I measured in diode mode to

---------08:23----------
ground or you can do this with

---------08:25----------
resistance mode if your multimeter

---------08:26----------
doesn't have dialed mode diet mode is a

---------08:27----------
bit easier and it'll just quicker to

---------08:30----------
work with what I did is I also measured

---------08:31----------
on the other side so you see how this

---------08:34----------
USB ext B goes to a MUX chip so let's

---------08:38----------
find that so that goes to this thing

---------08:41----------
over here and then this is going to go

---------08:44----------
to the PCH so what I did is I go to the

---------08:46----------
PCH is USB section over here so you have

---------08:50----------
USB

---------08:51----------
eech i know you can't see so you have

---------08:55----------
USB e CH i USB XE h i and all this other

---------08:59----------
USB crap so you know what I'm doing over

---------09:01----------
here is I'm measuring a dialed motor

---------09:04----------
ground my red probe on ground my black

---------09:05----------
probe on there or if you don't have that

---------09:07----------
you can use resistance mode I'm

---------09:08----------
comparing my values to unknown working

---------09:10----------
ward and what this is gonna do is it's

---------09:12----------
gonna tell me if my PCH is dead so if my

---------09:16----------
PCH is my values are gonna be

---------09:18----------
very very different

---------09:19----------
and if thing if the issue was with my

---------09:21----------
PCH then this is over then I'm you know

---------09:25----------
no you're gonna you're gonna you're

---------09:26----------
gonna buy yourself a little USB hub but

---------09:29----------
you're just gonna live with the

---------09:30----------
fact that you have one USB port and use

---------09:32----------
your firewire your Thunderbolt cuz hell

---------09:34----------
if I'm hell if I'm replace again I am

---------09:37----------
NOT replacing a PCH on a known good

---------09:39----------
board there's a small chance of me

---------09:41----------
 up the soldering there's a

---------09:43----------
really big chance of the PCH that you

---------09:46----------
buy on the internet being complete pile

---------09:48----------
of you know and like we can knock

---------09:50----------
on an inner soles door and say hi inner

---------09:52----------
cell I'd like a PCH here's 50 bucks will

---------09:55----------
you give me one outlet that that doesn't

---------09:57----------
happen that that's not how the world

---------09:58----------
works unfortunately you know again

---------10:00----------
someday we're gonna let some day people

---------10:02----------
are gonna laugh over the fact that we

---------10:03----------
had a scavenge and dumpster dive to find

---------10:06----------
stuff to fix anything someday the world

---------10:07----------
will laugh but right now the way the

---------10:09----------
world works it is a joke we fix stuff by

---------10:12----------
dumpster diving and it's wrong and it's

---------10:14----------
 and it's crap that's you know

---------10:17----------
the world isn't perfect and what you

---------10:19----------
just have to live with it so the USB

---------10:21----------
port that wasn't working was this one

---------10:23----------
over here so I'm gonna plug this thing

---------10:25----------
in

---------10:26----------
and what I want you to see is that it's

---------10:28----------
going to see my USB 3 enclosure with an

---------10:31----------
SSD plugged into it over there and it's

---------10:33----------
gonna show me a little external drive

---------10:34----------
icon on the screen and when I see a

---------10:36----------
little external drive icon I'll know

---------10:38----------
that that USB is good where it was not

---------10:41----------
good before I don't think I plug the

---------10:46----------
keyboard in all the way so instead of

---------10:47----------
show me that I kind of may just start

---------10:49----------
booting into an operating system which

---------10:51----------
is also good because that'll also show

---------10:53----------
you that USB works um why do you always

---------11:01----------
have to do something stupid or not work

---------11:03----------
when I turn the camera on

---------11:05----------
is it absolutely necessary to make me

---------11:06----------
look like an idiot for every video is it

---------11:08----------
really necessary motherboard okay so I

---------11:11----------
don't plug the keyboard in all the way

---------11:12----------
whatever it's it's it's 4:00 in the

---------11:14----------
morning I'm tired that but what you

---------11:17----------
can see over here is that I am booting

---------11:19----------
into the operating system that is on my

---------11:23----------
little SSD with this USB 3 it's a SATA

---------11:28----------
Startech thing I got on Amazon for 12

---------11:30----------
bucks really useful little tool it's

---------11:32----------
great because it's it's USB 3 it's a

---------11:34----------
really adorable wire and although the

---------11:37----------
entire chipset is inside of here it's

---------11:38----------
made to be used by people you know like

---------11:41----------
us that are not using it with it with a

---------11:44----------
drive where we're gonna keep it in there

---------11:46----------
like an Inc you know like a backup drive

---------11:48----------
that we're gonna build for ourselves

---------11:50----------
this is meant to be used by people who

---------11:52----------
are just handling raw drives and just

---------11:54----------
leaving them out for testing purposes so

---------11:56----------
as you can see here I am able to boot it

---------11:59----------
is gonna take a while because I don't

---------12:02----------
have a trackpad or a battery plugged in

---------12:04----------
so it's gonna run slow but it does work

---------12:08----------
actually yeah this is the wrong SSD this

---------12:11----------
is the one that has a SD on it and since

---------12:13----------
it's not the a SD for that machine

---------12:14----------
well it ain't never gonna boot but you

---------12:18----------
get the idea so we have working USB and

---------12:20----------
and the really the lesson that I want

---------12:22----------
you to get from this video is to

---------12:23----------
understand that measuring components

---------12:26----------
yeah and this is this is what really

---------12:27----------
sucks for new people but it's something

---------12:29----------
that I wish was pointed out to me again

---------12:30----------
if somebody had pointed this out to me

---------12:32----------
you know 10 years ago my life would have

---------12:34----------
been a lot easier for a long time what I

---------12:36----------
would have wished somebody pointed out

---------12:37----------
to me is that what you can you the way

---------12:39----------
you measure is not always just

---------12:42----------
mathematically it's not sometimes you

---------12:44----------
measure with your eyeballs sometimes

---------12:46----------
your eyes are gonna tell you that

---------12:47----------
something looks like crap when it

---------12:49----------
mentions 47 ohms on the multimeter and

---------12:50----------
it's gonna tell you that while the

---------12:51----------
component is actually good at the solder

---------12:54----------
joint under it it is not the V is right

---------12:57----------
by it is nasty or sometimes it's gonna

---------13:00----------
be that the component actually measures

---------13:01----------
fine because it because the signal that

---------13:04----------
you're sending through it's for

---------13:04----------
measuring is is is a very basic signal

---------13:08----------
but the signal that's actually going

---------13:10----------
through it on the board is a very

---------13:11----------
complex signal and that complex signal

---------13:13----------
can't make it through that component

---------13:15----------
once that component has failed but the

---------13:17----------
simple signal will make it through

---------13:18----------
it's these types of things that are

---------13:20----------
gonna drive you nuts it's these type of

---------13:21----------
things that are gonna keep you up at

---------13:22----------
night it's these types of things that

---------13:24----------
are gonna make you look like an idiot

---------13:25----------
it's these types of things that have

---------13:26----------
made me look like an idiot so I feel

---------13:29----------
like sharing so that you don't look like

---------13:31----------
an idiot so as always I hope you learned

---------13:33----------
something
