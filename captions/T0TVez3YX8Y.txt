---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna be

---------00:01----------
working on a MacBook Pro Retina that is

---------00:03----------
not turning on not charging the battery

---------00:05----------
not giving a green light in the charger

---------00:07----------
when I first plug in the charger you'll

---------00:11----------
see a green light flicker on for a quick

---------00:13----------
second and by you I mean me because I

---------00:15----------
know that with the shitty lighting in

---------00:17----------
this office there is no way in hell

---------00:19----------
you're going to see that actually

---------00:21----------
flicker yeah Who am I kidding there so

---------00:25----------
I'm gonna plug in a known good DC and

---------00:27----------
board I don't trust this person's DC and

---------00:29----------
board yeah it's a rainy shitty day

---------00:37----------
outside yeah I'll show you under the

---------00:40----------
microscope you have a actual chance of

---------00:42----------
seeing it there you just turn the light

---------00:44----------
off on the camera so I plug it in and

---------00:48----------
you get that I don't know if you were

---------00:53----------
able to see that it turns on/off

---------01:04----------
and then it's done so let's go over and

---------01:09----------
try to figure out why this is shall we

---------01:10----------
so first thing to do here is see if

---------01:14----------
there's anything going on with the

---------01:15----------
current sensing circuit however before

---------01:16----------
we even go over current sense you know

---------01:17----------
how current sends it could influence

---------01:18----------
this let's go over some of the areas

---------01:21----------
that have some corrosion left this is

---------01:23----------
something that was clean with the

---------01:24----------
standard toothbrush and alcohol and

---------01:26----------
you'll get to see just how bad that is

---------01:28----------
is to just a microscope camera so it

---------01:30----------
doesn't look like anymore there we

---------01:32----------
go hopefully that tearing stuff is gone

---------01:34----------
and you're seeing a nice fluid 60 frames

---------01:37----------
per second without the you know the

---------01:39----------
lines and the stuff showing up so you

---------01:40----------
got some corrosion around here here and

---------01:48----------
let's take a look at what this thing is

---------01:49----------
for what it does now we're also going to

---------01:52----------
talk a little bit about how the charger

---------01:55----------
and how the MagSafe charger works while

---------01:57----------
we're here the first thing to do here is

---------02:01----------
open up a schematic diagram for the

---------02:03----------
eight to zero 34 76

---------02:15----------
then here we are

---------02:27----------
now what we're looking at over there I

---------02:31----------
believe is q70 180 and I say I believe

---------02:33----------
because I don't remember oh that's not

---------02:36----------
that's q70 130 I'm losing it all right

---------02:40----------
let's see so where is q70 180 oh wait a

---------02:45----------
second

---------02:45----------
yeah I am losing it I thought that was

---------02:48----------
huh-huh

---------02:49----------
okay so q70 130 is the one with the

---------02:51----------
corrosion around it so q70 130 is gonna

---------02:53----------
be over here and this is the transistor

---------02:55----------
involved in making peepee buzz g3 hot

---------02:57----------
it's the transistor involved in the buck

---------02:58----------
regulator that's making peepee buzz g3

---------03:01----------
OTT so first thing we're gonna do here

---------03:02----------
since this is corroded and has a direct

---------03:04----------
path to ground I'm going to check and

---------03:06----------
see if there's a short to ground over

---------03:07----------
here so let's take a look in that area

---------03:11----------
I'm gonna measure on pin 1 of L 71 30s

---------03:16----------
so L 71 31 and we're gonna get over in

---------03:24----------
check see what we get so let's see if

---------03:26----------
there's any type of short to ground that

---------03:28----------
could be causing this behavior make sure

---------03:31----------
you can see in there so yeah that's fine

---------03:40----------
there's nothing wrong here I was

---------03:43----------
checking a couple of others points that

---------03:45----------
I'm used to being a screwed up

---------03:54----------
hmm okay so this one's going to suck I

---------03:59----------
thought it was Q 7180 you know why that

---------04:02----------
sucks is because I thought I had a

---------04:04----------
chance of this actually being easy man

---------04:09----------
welcome to the videos that never make

---------04:11----------
their way to YouTube where I actually

---------04:13----------
actually use my brain and figure it out

---------04:16----------
for myself I want to use my brain

---------04:19----------
everybody else gets along not using

---------04:21----------
their brain why do I have to use mine

---------04:24----------
okay time for brain this part sucks

---------04:29----------
alright let's explain how the charger

---------04:31----------
works a little bit here so the charger

---------04:33----------
is not going to let power through to the

---------04:34----------
machine unless it sees a load and if

---------04:36----------
this transistor is not opening Q 7180

---------04:39----------
it's not going to actually see a load

---------04:41----------
which means it's going to turn on for a

---------04:42----------
quick millisecond illiterate self right

---------04:45----------
off right so there are a couple of

---------04:47----------
things that could cause us to not open

---------04:49----------
the il-62 5:9 could cause it to not open

---------04:51----------
it itself could be bad which could be

---------04:53----------
causing this if there's corrosion over

---------04:54----------
here I don't know maybe something around

---------04:56----------
it got screwed up so we're just going to

---------04:58----------
check some of the standard things that

---------04:59----------
caused this to happen let's see if the

---------05:01----------
current sensing section over here is

---------05:03----------
working the way it's supposed to

---------05:06----------
amber current if you don't know what

---------05:08----------
current sensing is view the videos that

---------05:09----------
I've done on consensus it will make

---------05:11----------
every all of this make a lot of sense so

---------05:13----------
this is going to tell how much power the

---------05:16----------
charger is pulling the this chip is

---------05:18----------
going to read the difference in voltage

---------05:20----------
between the top and the bottom this is

---------05:22----------
gonna be a bigger voltage difference

---------05:23----------
depending on you know if there's gonna

---------05:25----------
be a bigger voltage difference if the

---------05:27----------
computer is using more current which is

---------05:29----------
how they use 70 100 will tell however if

---------05:31----------
anything in this loop is blown it's not

---------05:33----------
gonna work right so we're gonna check by

---------05:34----------
our 71 21 and all right 71 22 and I'm

---------05:42----------
going there let's see where is Karen

---------05:44----------
sensing here where are you hiding okay

---------05:47----------
this is one of them I'm measuring the

---------05:50----------
entire circuit here

---------05:53----------
that's diode Margo what the hell not

---------05:56----------
diode MO you want resistance alright so

---------06:00----------
this one is probably the battery one

---------06:01----------
because why why you don't want you to

---------06:03----------
beep off

---------06:06----------
this is probably the battery one the

---------06:09----------
battery one below is the one that's

---------06:10----------
about 2 point 2 ohms altogether yeah so

---------06:14----------
see the battery also has ocurred sit

---------06:16----------
Sixth Circuit attached to it well you

---------06:18----------
won our seventy one fifty two and that's

---------06:20----------
two point two plus zero plus zero point

---------06:23----------
zero zero five all right so now we're

---------06:24----------
going to check the charger current

---------06:27----------
sensing circuit just gonna be this one

---------06:29----------
over here what I'm doing is I'm

---------06:31----------
measuring the entire resistance of the

---------06:33----------
circuit and twenty ohms

---------06:36----------
alright so could be a couple of

---------06:38----------
different things remember the the green

---------06:39----------
light is present when PPE 3v4 to

---------06:42----------
underscore g3 hot as presents so I'm

---------06:44----------
just gonna plug in my MagSafe here and

---------06:47----------
cfpb three before to underscore g3 hot

---------06:49----------
is present where it's supposed to be for

---------06:51----------
those of you who don't usually follow

---------06:52----------
these videos I would suggest you check

---------06:54----------
out my one wire circuit videos so that

---------06:56----------
you know what I mean when I say that I

---------06:57----------
need P P 3 V 4 to be present in order

---------07:00----------
for me to have a green light

---------07:01----------
so I don't want to check up here and I'm

---------07:03----------
going to see if P P 3 V 4 2 is present

---------07:07----------
it's not present I have now I'm

---------07:12----------
gonna check to see if I have a short to

---------07:14----------
ground on that particular rail it's not

---------07:23----------
no short to ground all right so now what

---------07:26----------
I'm going to do is I'm we want to check

---------07:28----------
the beginning of the circuit so all

---------07:47----------
right do you think I should go for it or

---------07:49----------
are they being salespeople I'll go for

---------07:57----------
it

---------07:59----------
 now thank you

---------08:04----------
sounds like my JBC is getting fixed it

---------08:07----------
sounds like steve's attempts to bargain

---------08:09----------
with JBC have failed

---------08:10----------
oh well 289 bucks for that nozzle though

---------08:16----------
that's 280 I mean you can buy a hot-air

---------08:19----------
station for that much money but it's

---------08:21----------
worth it it's a good station you know

---------08:24----------
people are like Lois you should ask

---------08:26----------
these companies if they want to sponsor

---------08:27----------
your show they Co are you kidding me I

---------08:29----------
keep kidding me

---------08:31----------
that's not happening in my lifetime

---------08:33----------
anyway back to business here so now

---------08:36----------
we're gonna check the beginning of the

---------08:37----------
pp 3 before 2 circuit

---------09:10----------
all right so let's see if I have power

---------09:11----------
coming in here are 70 20s so this is the

---------09:15----------
going to be the input to this circuit so

---------09:16----------
the whole idea is I'd like to check the

---------09:18----------
beginning in the end of a circuit the

---------09:19----------
reason is you should if there's a larger

---------09:22----------
problem I always kind of want to be

---------09:23----------
aware of the larger problem before I

---------09:25----------
continue down the rabbit hole so if I

---------09:27----------
start going let me troubleshoot you 70

---------09:29----------
90 let me troubleshoot an issue with the

---------09:31----------
PP 3 before 2 generator a regulator chip

---------09:33----------
then you know if there's a problem

---------09:35----------
before it I'm never gonna know but the

---------09:37----------
way I'm doing it right now if there's no

---------09:39----------
power going into you 70 90 I'm gonna

---------09:41----------
figure it out immediately so plug it in

---------09:43----------
and we're gonna check on our 70 20 here

---------09:46----------
go back to voltage mode in the meter

---------09:54----------
yeah you 1 0 spikes and goes down spikes

---------10:05----------
and goes down spikes and goes down hmm

---------10:08----------
now knowing that the charger is not

---------10:10----------
going to output voltage if it doesn't

---------10:12----------
see a load but maybe it's not seeing the

---------10:15----------
system load because Q 70 71 80 is blown

---------10:21----------
wouldn't it be cool if the actual

---------10:24----------
problem with the board was the problem I

---------10:25----------
thought it was in the beginning yeah

---------10:28----------
let's go with that

---------10:29----------
trusty

---------10:34----------
I trust my instincts turn on that Whaler

---------10:39----------
gonna make sure that I'm really really

---------10:42----------
patient here because you know thing

---------10:44----------
takes forever to actually get hot

---------10:52----------
mmm

---------10:56----------
once upon a time I thought that was the

---------10:58----------
best station ever

---------10:59----------
I miss my JBC I have to fix that thing

---------11:12----------
the JBC kicks the ever-loving out

---------11:15----------
of the hakko and the Weller I love it

---------11:19----------
man 289 bucks to fix that thing $289

---------12:04----------
yeah that's worth 289 bucks yeah waiting

---------12:09----------
this long is

---------12:24----------
would you like some with your flax

---------12:26----------
milk hey my flux ran away

---------13:05----------
what am i doing it's fine stop soldering

---------13:08----------
you with my attempt to make it

---------13:14----------
perfect I'm just making it worse and

---------13:19----------
we're gonna get a new transistor on

---------13:21----------
there

---------14:59----------
looks like somehow 9,000 right

---------15:01----------
there if I up by changing all

---------15:06----------
these settings there we go Hal 9000

---------15:16----------
charging MOSFET now for the ultimate

---------15:22----------
test we got to make sure that every

---------15:23----------
function on this works I have to make

---------15:26----------
sure every function works because I'm

---------15:28----------
getting trolled in these videos you know

---------15:29----------
okay you showed us the light works but

---------15:31----------
does that mean that everything works

---------15:33----------
does that mean that everything is good

---------15:36----------
how do we know that you're not lying at

---------15:39----------
the end you're not coming you're not

---------15:41----------
coming back here and not telling us when

---------15:42----------
stuff doesn't fully work are you well

---------15:45----------
guess what how about this right here I'm

---------15:48----------
gonna show you beyond any reasonable

---------15:49----------
doubt that everything on this device

---------15:52----------
works ready check it out check it out

---------15:59----------
see that that's a spinning fan which

---------16:07----------
means we're done and that's it for today

---------16:12----------
as always I hope you learned something

---------16:15----------
but just to go over in case you didn't

---------16:18----------
know these Apple chargers will not give

---------16:21----------
out voltage they won't give out if

---------16:22----------
they don't see a load if it doesn't see

---------16:24----------
a load for whatever reason it's not

---------16:26----------
going to work so it needs to see a load

---------16:28----------
and if that transistor is blown and you

---------16:32----------
just look at the board and you kind of

---------16:33----------
get an idea of where the corrosion was

---------16:35----------
then you start thinking about what it

---------16:36----------
could have affected and you start

---------16:37----------
looking at your problem you start

---------16:39----------
comparing what could be have been

---------16:41----------
affected by the Spill what is actually

---------16:43----------
going on and eventually your detective

---------16:46----------
brain will lead you to what it is and

---------16:48----------
that's it for today this video brought

---------16:54----------
to you by Weller WH a knight now

---------16:57----------
off outta here

---------16:58----------
I can't wait to get this thing back in

---------17:00----------
the student workstation where it belongs

---------17:01----------
I miss you j bc i miss you you know how

---------17:05----------
I broke the JVC I broke the JBC in a

---------17:07----------
really dumb way so when i'm when i'm

---------17:10----------
replacing macbook air screens I use I

---------17:12----------
use this and I showed you that I heat i

---------17:14----------
heat this so that when i as soon as I

---------17:16----------
put the spatula in I can just go around

---------17:19----------
it and the adhesive just melts right off

---------17:21----------
well I didn't have a nozzle on this

---------17:23----------
because I was moving an iPhone shield as

---------17:24----------
my last job which by the way why you

---------17:26----------
should never fix iPhones because if you

---------17:28----------
fix iPhones it'll cause you to ruin your

---------17:30----------
$1,800 hot-air station so and I shove

---------17:33----------
this right up in there thinking oh I'm

---------17:35----------
gonna get it I'm gonna get it to heat up

---------17:37----------
faster and I'm touching the heating

---------17:38----------
element and I'm shorting the heating

---------17:40----------
element to the case like you're

---------17:41----------
like an idiot which is why I'm now

---------17:43----------
paying the $289 idiot fee to get my JVC

---------17:47----------
back cuz I miss it I don't I don't I

---------17:49----------
don't want to use this anymore I'm sorry

---------17:51----------
I know I spoke nice of you months ago

---------17:53----------
but you clean that thing is just so much

---------17:55----------
better especially with this like

---------17:58----------
you see how long this is you see how

---------17:59----------
long the hot part is this is one of the

---------18:00----------
things that I didn't notice until later

---------18:02----------
on because there's no shield over this

---------18:04----------
like the hacker at least has that crappy

---------18:05----------
plastic shield over it right but this is

---------18:08----------
really thick really long this doesn't

---------18:11----------
sound right it's really thick

---------18:13----------
it's really long it's black oh this is

---------18:17----------
sounding even worse

---------18:18----------
and the ID there's no recovering from

---------18:22----------
that is there and the whole idea here is

---------18:24----------
when I'm heating it and I have let's say

---------18:26----------
I have my tweezers here and I have this

---------18:30----------
here this is gonna burn my hand and it

---------18:34----------
sucks

---------18:34----------
whereas this this JBC one which is

---------18:38----------
wrapped around my chair and in the

---------18:40----------
machine and a bunch of other stuff the

---------18:44----------
handpiece is up here this part is thin

---------18:46----------
it's closer to the bottom and it's not

---------18:48----------
that long so it's it's less likely to

---------18:52----------
burn you and it's just that I prefer it

---------18:54----------
that way I like I like having a lower

---------18:56----------
likelihood of having my hand burned over

---------18:58----------
the course of a repair that being said

---------19:00----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------19:03----------
you learned something and I hope this

---------19:05----------
was actually in sync

---------19:13----------
you
