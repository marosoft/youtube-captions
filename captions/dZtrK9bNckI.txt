---------00:00----------
here we have yet another MacBook this

---------00:02----------
MacBook has no power it needs to be

---------00:04----------
fixed this is an a 1398 MacBook let's

---------00:07----------
open this MacBook up and figure out

---------00:08----------
what's wrong with it it's 2:45 in the

---------00:10----------
morning and we're gonna fix a MacBook

---------00:12----------
this is an 8 to 0 de 33:32 board they

---------00:16----------
say it doesn't turn on but is that

---------00:17----------
really the case something tells me

---------00:19----------
you're a you 8900 issue masquerading as

---------00:21----------
a no power nope

---------00:22----------
you are indeed ed 30 milliamps taken no

---------00:25----------
turning on let's get to the bottom of

---------00:27----------
this so I'm plug everything from this

---------00:29----------
MacBook and see why it doesn't want to

---------00:31----------
turn on going home is going to suck it

---------00:33----------
as a straight up freezer outside this

---------00:36----------
takes a hundred milliamps

---------00:37----------
ok so 100 milliamps typically that's PP

---------00:39----------
but g3 hot missing or else's power good

---------00:41----------
missing one way to find out where the

---------00:44----------
problem here lies let's check through

---------00:47----------
our power rails and see what we have

---------00:49----------
let's get to Paul Daniel software

---------00:50----------
running pray that it works today our pp

---------00:53----------
best g3 hot is twelve point six o clock

---------00:58----------
voltage three point three PP v vs v 5.0

---------01:04----------
PP v vs 4 5 volts ok let's skip ahead

---------01:10----------
and check out PP v vs o let's see if

---------01:15----------
we're making it to an Esso state PP v vs

---------01:19----------
o present alright so we're in an Esso

---------01:23----------
state meaning we're gonna be missing one

---------01:25----------
of the s o rails so let's go through and

---------01:27----------
see if all says power good is present

---------01:29----------
because all says power good is going to

---------01:31----------
be present when all the rails that I

---------01:34----------
need to get CPU vcore are there so the

---------01:37----------
way this works is g3 hard with the rails

---------01:38----------
that always have to be present as five

---------01:40----------
of the rails present unsought off as for

---------01:43----------
the rails president when it is suspended

---------01:44----------
to disk as three of the rails that are

---------01:46----------
present when it suspend - Ram has over

---------01:49----------
the panel rails that have to be present

---------01:50----------
for the machine to be on so for example

---------01:52----------
a power rail to allow the machine to

---------01:54----------
charge would be considered a g3 hot rail

---------01:56----------
a rail that's on all the time because

---------01:58----------
even if your computer is completely

---------01:59----------
turned off you want it to be able to

---------02:00----------
charge whereas a rail for LCD backlight

---------02:04----------
would be an Sol because you don't need

---------02:06----------
the light of the screen to be on when

---------02:07----------
the machine is sleeping hibernating or

---------02:09----------
off but you do need to be on when it's

---------02:11----------
on so we're going to scroll over to the

---------02:12----------
list of

---------02:13----------
rales after we actually first know even

---------02:16----------
better than that would be to check out

---------02:17----------
the all see our good circuit I'm gonna

---------02:20----------
go here and see which rails are missing

---------02:23----------
in what I'm need so let's take a look so

---------02:27----------
we need PP 5 ves let's see pp 3 V 3 s oh

---------02:31----------
let's check that one and see if P P 3 v

---------02:34----------
3s I was present I'm gonna go through

---------02:35----------
every single one of these and measure

---------02:38----------
each of them because if all these rails

---------02:40----------
are not present the machine will not

---------02:41----------
turn on all right we got I think we've

---------02:44----------
got 5 or 6 boards working tonight and

---------02:46----------
one that I wasn't able to fix so this is

---------02:48----------
going pretty well I'm gonna keep going

---------02:49----------
as long as my slowest by luck continues

---------02:53----------
as long as I continue to get lucky I

---------02:55----------
don't get lucky very often I would be

---------02:57----------
expecting VP 3 V 3 s Oh on this pad over

---------03:00----------
here and that is present so the next up

---------03:04----------
is going to be PP u 1 V 5 PP 1 v 5s oh

---------03:11----------
okay let's let's find you so I would

---------03:16----------
expect to find you where show me show me

---------03:24----------
show me show me show me show me

---------03:32----------
Paul what the why don't we not have a

---------03:35----------
line going through every single part

---------03:37----------
that it supposed to that's one of the

---------03:39----------
features of this program the core

---------03:40----------
features can't get anything to work

---------03:43----------
right here

---------03:44----------
pp 1 B 5 underscore s oh okay so I

---------03:50----------
double click I hit search and which pad

---------03:55----------
is it fall so this one is it this one is

---------03:57----------
it this one is it this one tough Paul is

---------04:00----------
planting bugs in this software

---------04:02----------
while I sleep I'm gonna guess that what

---------04:04----------
I'm looking for is over here I say guess

---------04:07----------
because you can never be certain when it

---------04:10----------
comes to Paul Daniels and Australian

---------04:12----------
software can never be certain one point

---------04:17----------
35 volts is there

---------04:19----------
next up P P 1 vo 5s o 1 P P 1 vo 5 s o

---------04:24----------
is present okay next okay next up p1 v5

---------04:29----------
SOP good

---------04:31----------
p1 v8 SOP good around cp1 viateur so P P

---------04:37----------
we're closed

---------04:38----------
 3m you bastard get the out

---------04:45----------
of my store 1.8 volts all right next up

---------04:51----------
P 5 vs 4 P good we have that I already

---------04:53----------
checked that one

---------04:54----------
I had CPU VCC io v CC IO

---------05:31----------
I comes out of you 7600 you 7600 let's

---------05:38----------
see so I can see if I'm getting that on

---------05:42----------
all right 7640 that's supposed to be one

---------05:47----------
point zero five volts and I can measure

---------05:50----------
the output of that on pins two and four

---------05:52----------
but you're gonna be over here that's

---------06:00----------
there okay next up pc h vc cio okay what

---------06:04----------
rail is this that's something I could

---------06:07----------
measure here are ninety eight forty I'm

---------06:10----------
tense 103 it's one point zero five volts

---------06:15----------
as I expected it all right I think

---------06:17----------
there's only one more rail left here

---------06:36----------
then we have PPV CCS Oh reg and this

---------06:46----------
little current sensing resistor right

---------06:49----------
over here is where I can measure it okay

---------06:57----------
I think we have our answer

---------06:59----------
this is the rail that's missing so the

---------07:02----------
rail that's missing is PPV si si si s o

---------07:05----------
reg that's created by you

---------07:08----------
7100 you 7100 can be found on the board

---------07:14----------
let's see where do we find you you 7100

---------07:18----------
show us yourself that can be found over

---------07:23----------
here and this chip is going to be

---------07:27----------
enabled by P PVC PVC si si enable which

---------07:31----------
is going to be on pin 15 which is gonna

---------07:33----------
be up here so let's see if our enable is

---------07:36----------
probably no enable wait no that's not

---------07:44----------
the enable this is the enable okay we do

---------07:46----------
have enabled so enable is present output

---------07:49----------
is not all right that's what I would

---------07:53----------
expect this is going to the CPU after

---------07:56----------
all so 8 ohms the ground that's not a

---------07:57----------
short-circuit it's just normal

---------07:59----------
nano Q 70 100 is gonna be responsible

---------08:01----------
for making that here Hugh 70 100 looks

---------08:05----------
pretty Hardy I wouldn't say that there's

---------08:07----------
much wrong with this but there is an

---------08:09----------
issue it could be potentially that I

---------08:11----------
have an issue with this IC itself and

---------08:13----------
this is right along that fault lines you

---------08:15----------
have you 8900 here and then this chip

---------08:19----------
over here so you never know so we're

---------08:21----------
gonna do is we're gonna replace that

---------08:22----------
with another one

---------08:30----------
notice these are the good tweezers I

---------08:32----------
just found them

---------08:38----------
I've often dreamed of fixing a Macbook

---------08:40----------
actually Jonathan there are many times

---------08:42----------
in the beginning when I first started

---------08:44----------
out that I would spend hours on a

---------08:47----------
machine get nowhere and then I go home

---------08:49----------
might go to sleep

---------08:50----------
I'd have a dream and my in my dream I

---------08:52----------
went over the problem and then fixed it

---------08:54----------
and then I got back to the I would ride

---------08:56----------
my bike to the store at 3:00 or 4:00 in

---------08:58----------
the morning because I couldn't wait till

---------08:59----------
the next day to see if that solution if

---------09:01----------
I end up being the solution that worked

---------09:03----------
and fix the macbook and oftentimes it

---------09:05----------
did I've come up with some of my best

---------09:07----------
fixes in a dream

---------09:59----------
now it's time to see if we get fan spin

---------10:02----------
as you can see we have fan spin now

---------10:08----------
seeing that this is an eight to zero

---------10:09----------
dash 33:32 it's likely going to have GPU

---------10:12----------
kernel panics if we don't reflow the you

---------10:14----------
8900 area so I will get to that right

---------10:16----------
now and then we will call it a day since

---------10:19----------
that will be it yet another fixed

---------10:21----------
macbook those are some of the worst

---------10:23----------
solder joints I've ever seen in my life

---------10:25----------
typical quality for Apple and good stuff

---------10:30----------
good stuff

---------10:36----------
so once is there genuinely concerned for

---------10:38----------
my health well the purpose of health is

---------10:42----------
to be able to fix a Macbook so why not

---------10:46----------
just skip over the health part and just

---------10:47----------
get to the fixing MacBooks that's what I

---------10:50----------
figured

---------10:54----------
my health is worthless however my

---------10:58----------
macbook repair team is worth quite a bit

---------11:04----------
customers could give a crap less if I'm

---------11:07----------
healthy but they care about is that

---------11:09----------
their MacBook is fixed in a reasonable

---------11:11----------
timeframe

---------11:14----------
okay

---------11:29----------
beautiful

---------11:38----------
[Music]

---------11:39----------
that's quality so it looks like this

---------11:42----------
power rail for PPV CCSA the chip that

---------11:45----------
was supposed to be creating it was not

---------11:47----------
that is along the fault line of where

---------11:50----------
the u 8900 trip breaks on this board as

---------11:52----------
well where this board is constantly

---------11:54----------
flexing this board goes into a case

---------11:56----------
where it's flexing all the time so it

---------11:58----------
may have just needed to be reshot or not

---------12:00----------
replaced but i figure you know might as

---------12:01----------
well and it went working again we were

---------12:04----------
able to find it by checking all the

---------12:06----------
rails that are supposed to be present in

---------12:08----------
the AUSA's power good sequence all says

---------12:10----------
power good is what was required to get

---------12:12----------
the CPU to work and everything else

---------12:13----------
typically if you're in an Esso state but

---------12:15----------
one rail is missing you want to go

---------12:16----------
through the list of rails required for

---------12:18----------
also power good to be present in that

---------12:19----------
machine to figure out what's wrong with

---------12:22----------
it so that's it for this one and as

---------12:24----------
always I hope you learned something it

---------12:26----------
is 3:15 in the morning which means it's

---------12:28----------
time to fix yet another MacBook but

---------12:30----------
you'll have to wait until the next video

---------12:31----------
to check that one out

---------12:40----------
you

---------12:48----------
do you have a Macbook that needs to be

---------12:49----------
fixed come by our store which is open to

---------12:52----------
the public at 186 First Avenue in

---------12:54----------
Manhattan are you located outside of New

---------12:56----------
York no problem

---------12:57----------
send us a machine from anywhere in the

---------12:59----------
world by going to our website and

---------13:01----------
clicking on the mailbox or simply

---------13:03----------
heading over to send your macbook comm

---------13:05----------
that send your macbook comm will you be

---------13:08----------
redirected to our mail and instructions

---------13:10----------
page that includes the form and the

---------13:13----------
directions on how to send us a Macbook

---------13:18----------
can speak with us about the repair that

---------13:19----------
you need a phone number where a

---------13:21----------
representative will pick up during our
