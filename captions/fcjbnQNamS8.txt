---------00:04----------
don't delay by today so this here is a

---------00:08----------
touch bar MacBook as you can see here

---------00:11----------
this is nineteen point eight volts 0

---------00:12----------
amps so where's our pp bus the first

---------00:15----------
thing we need is a proper pp bus twelve

---------00:19----------
point six seems good screw going through

---------00:22----------
rails one by one

---------00:23----------
aha alright so after doing that let's

---------00:32----------
see if this MacBook much bar touch bar

---------00:35----------
turns on much bar is still dead zero

---------00:43----------
amps are being used

---------00:52----------
nastiness hmm is that capacitor on a

---------00:55----------
line that could be short-circuited that

---------00:57----------
capacitor is on want PP 12v SSD what's

---------01:02----------
its resistance to ground so one volt

---------01:04----------
rail so I expected to have a fairly low

---------01:07----------
resistance to ground 19 point 43 kilo

---------01:09----------
ohms so as nasty as this area's that's

---------01:13----------
not a point of contention for me no a

---------01:18----------
little bit of corrosion over there but

---------01:20----------
that's a negligible and according to the

---------01:22----------
schematics Kemetic schematic that's

---------01:26----------
something else for the SSD boring SSD

---------01:29----------
power rails not shorted hello what's

---------01:31----------
this oh boy

---------01:35----------
what are you for your UB 700 what do you

---------01:42----------
do you create PP 5 e for s for

---------01:45----------
thunderbolt 5 volt regulator PP 5 V s

---------01:48----------
for s underscore t underscore USB C and

---------01:53----------
I can measure the output of that on lb

---------01:56----------
700 where is lb 700 perhaps it's on the

---------02:02----------
other side of the board yes it's right

---------02:06----------
here right to the left or left to the

---------02:10----------
right over this

---------02:11----------
let's see if that short-circuited to

---------02:13----------
ground MacBook actually no kilohm hmm

---------03:17----------
how can Apple use such underrated high

---------03:20----------
side low side MOSFETs chokes and caps

---------03:22----------
and VRMs for i7 i9 products there's a

---------03:25----------
very simple answer to that my friend is

---------03:27----------
a very simple answer are you ready for

---------03:29----------
it

---------03:29----------
are you ready for it because you're

---------03:32----------
gonna buy it anyway as long as you're

---------03:34----------
going to buy it anyway and as long as

---------03:36----------
the users are going to continue to

---------03:37----------
defend the company that makes poor

---------03:39----------
design decisions they will continue to

---------03:40----------
get away with it so as long as you

---------03:42----------
continue to buy it they'll continue to

---------03:44----------
put it out there and they're gonna keep

---------03:45----------
pushing a lemon and see how much can we

---------03:47----------
cheap out how much engineering can we

---------03:49----------
outsource to somebody else how much

---------03:51----------
engineering can we have done by an

---------03:52----------
intern instead of a paid employee what

---------03:54----------
can we get away with and what they can

---------03:57----------
get away with is exactly what you let

---------04:00----------
them get away with there can be a lot of

---------04:02----------
things that are corroded but only one of

---------04:03----------
them that's actually relevant you gotta

---------04:04----------
come to learn what's actually relevant

---------04:06----------
like on the older boards I look and I go

---------04:08----------
USB circa corroded yon sensor corroded

---------04:11----------
yon PP bus circuit Oh interesting

---------04:13----------
I have to get to a point where I know

---------04:14----------
what stuff is needed and what is not on

---------04:16----------
here that's gonna be a while all right

---------04:18----------
so this is trackpad can SPI connection

---------04:23----------
this hit this is something to do with

---------04:26----------
the trackpad SPI can I that has nothing

---------04:28----------
to do with why my thing is not working

---------04:31----------
so I don't care that that's corroded

---------04:33----------
just yet this has a little bit of

---------04:36----------
nastiness near it

---------04:42----------
what are you for that's you 7,000 this

---------04:45----------
chip creates PP bus g3 ha which happens

---------04:48----------
to be present so I can ignore that and

---------04:50----------
move on to the oh my god what's this

---------04:54----------
what's all this stuff over here so it's

---------04:57----------
a bunch of pull-up resistors PM Ricimer

---------04:59----------
isset PM sleep s 3l bingo sm c PM g 2 en

---------05:05----------
so this is where all the enables are for

---------05:08----------
all the different power lines this is

---------05:11----------
important

---------05:12----------
PM IC and power control ding-ding-ding

---------05:14----------
we have found our answer as to what is

---------05:16----------
actually important and what needs to be

---------05:18----------
fixed on this board so we're just gonna

---------05:20----------
put a little bit of flux

---------05:22----------
that's one micro pall of flux one micro

---------05:28----------
Paul see we found the important the

---------05:32----------
corroded section so it can be a lot of

---------05:37----------
corroded sections but only one of them

---------05:38----------
is going to be one that's actually worth

---------05:40----------
putting time into

---------05:55----------
shake it off

---------06:00----------
scrape it off shake it off scrape it off

---------06:07----------
shake it off scrape it off

---------06:16----------
melt crappy solder joint sorry hot

---------06:26----------
yes good crappy solder joints now cool

---------06:32----------
yourself crappy solder joints

---------06:50----------
variety I think we found the cause of

---------06:52----------
our problem can anybody say they see

---------06:55----------
what the cause of our problem is see

---------06:58----------
what I said about finding the right area

---------07:00----------
this is the area that's important all

---------07:03----------
the enable signals are and will you look

---------07:09----------
at that wow I'm barely scraping and it's

---------07:12----------
just gone look at that

---------07:16----------
[Music]

---------07:30----------
[Applause]

---------07:32----------
[Music]

---------07:41----------
all right so we've scraped away the

---------07:43----------
coppery on the PCB now we're going

---------07:51----------
to run a jumper wire we're gonna put a

---------07:57----------
tiny one micro pall of flux

---------08:13----------
now I don't know if that piece under it

---------08:15----------
is actually going to ground or something

---------08:17----------
else I'm gonna run my wire around this

---------08:20----------
you never know in case I dug too deeper

---------08:26----------
did something stupid damn these tweezers

---------08:29----------
are destroyed

---------08:36----------
these are no longer tweezers

---------09:01----------
need to get a new set of tweezers I'm

---------09:05----------
gonna scrape with the exacto and tweeze

---------09:07----------
with the tweezers I'm gonna make a new

---------09:09----------
year's resolution to myself starting

---------09:11----------
immediately

---------09:12----------
- never scrape with tweezers again but

---------09:16----------
it's very tempting to do that but it's

---------09:18----------
very bad to do that okay we plug it in

---------09:24----------
let's see if we get any change as can be

---------09:28----------
seen here our touch bar is drawing power

---------09:33----------
and it's working this touch bar has been

---------09:37----------
made great again by that little jumper

---------09:39----------
wire but we have PP 5v underscore PMI CL

---------09:43----------
do so that comes out of you 7800 which

---------09:46----------
looks like PMI C and power control where

---------09:50----------
does it go has to go to something

---------09:54----------
alright it goes to one part of banjo

---------09:57----------
which is the same chip so it goes from

---------10:00----------
one side of banjo to another really this

---------10:03----------
is a BGA p.m. ice you 7800 this is an IC

---------10:10----------
you 7800 okay this this genuinely

---------10:19----------
confuses me why would this signal why

---------10:21----------
would that trace missing even matter

---------10:23----------
look at this am I am I losing it is this

---------10:27----------
am i being silly here no seriously look

---------10:29----------
so p.m. BP 5 e p.m. I see L do the

---------10:32----------
jumper wire for it was broken but it

---------10:34----------
seems like a signal that's completely

---------10:36----------
self-contained within you 7800 look it's

---------10:39----------
going to you 7,800 ball m10 it's going

---------10:42----------
to use 7800 ball a 13 it's going to use

---------10:47----------
7800 ball and 7 it's going to use 7800

---------10:51----------
are seven eight six six beef before this

---------10:55----------
is zero ohm resistor before it goes to

---------10:57----------
another part of you 7800 this signal

---------11:01----------
appears to be entirely self-contained

---------11:03----------
within one ship so this makes no sense

---------11:07----------
this makes absolutely no sense why would

---------11:10----------
it matter if a trace was broken because

---------11:11----------
think about that signal is entirely

---------11:13----------
created with

---------11:15----------
one ship it's created and distributed

---------11:17----------
within that one ship so if a trace on

---------11:20----------
the board is broken and that trace is

---------11:22----------
for that signal why would it matter if

---------11:24----------
that is entirely self-contained within

---------11:26----------
one ship so let's figure out where you

---------11:29----------
7800 is so you 7800 is gonna be the

---------11:36----------
power management chip which is though

---------11:42----------
yeah so that's going to be the chip

---------11:44----------
that's right over here so that signal

---------11:47----------
that we reattach with that jumper wire

---------11:49----------
on this side of the board we read it's

---------11:53----------
not like that signal comes from the CPU

---------11:55----------
and then goes to the PM IC or it goes

---------11:57----------
from the PM IC to the charging IC or

---------12:00----------
goes from the PM IC to the SMC or the

---------12:04----------
chip that creates the five volt rail or

---------12:06----------
anything like that that signal is

---------12:08----------
entirely self-contained within this one

---------12:10----------
chip yet for some reason if a trace gets

---------12:13----------
corroded on the board that chip with the

---------12:16----------
dimension the board just stops working

---------12:17----------
you understand why this makes no sense

---------12:20----------
it's it's it's like saying that if I'm

---------12:24----------
sitting next to you right let's say

---------12:26----------
somebody named Chris was sitting next to

---------12:28----------
me and our cell phones were broken

---------12:30----------
that's like saying that we're no longer

---------12:32----------
able to talk to each other or

---------12:33----------
communicate because both of our cell

---------12:35----------
phones are broken but I'm sitting right

---------12:37----------
next to the person so how is it that

---------12:38----------
we're unable to communicate you know

---------12:40----------
it's just silly it's stupid it doesn't

---------12:41----------
make a damn bit of sense I mean that

---------12:46----------
that just really like why and now let's

---------12:53----------
say that that signal was linked from one

---------12:56----------
part of that trip to the other chip

---------12:58----------
let's say it was something that's stupid

---------12:59----------
and crazy why is it that that's

---------13:01----------
happening on the other side of the board

---------13:03----------
if you wish to combine several pads

---------13:05----------
internally why not simply have traces on

---------13:08----------
this side of the board under the chip

---------13:09----------
why run that trace on the other side of

---------13:12----------
the board so that a signal can duplicate

---------13:16----------
itself or something within one chip

---------13:18----------
I don't get it really really and I'm the

---------13:25----------
one with the brain injury

---------13:28----------
Apple if you're hiring I think finally

---------13:32----------
got the qualifications all right that's

---------13:34----------
it for today and as always I hope you

---------13:36----------
learned something

---------13:44----------
don't delay by today
