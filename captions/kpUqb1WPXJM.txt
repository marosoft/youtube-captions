---------00:00----------
today we're gonna be working on an 8 to

---------00:01----------
0-4 9 to 4 board that's not turning on

---------00:04----------
my useless assistant here

---------00:06----------
introduce yourself useless assistant is

---------00:09----------
eating and he is not fixing stuff

---------00:11----------
because well no I'm kidding he's a good

---------00:13----------
guy he's a good guy come here big hug

---------00:15----------
big hug ok doesn't want a big hug he's

---------00:17----------
meeting his hashtag meeting because I

---------00:19----------
did that any so today we've got a 8 to

---------00:22----------
0-4 9 to 4 board here and it appears to

---------00:25----------
be dead we're gonna try and figure out

---------00:26----------
why that is now one cool thing that I

---------00:27----------
did is actually realize I could switch

---------00:30----------
the lenses from my NEX ei 50 and my a

---------00:32----------
5100 because I don't need a zoom lens

---------00:34----------
for my face but I do need a zoom lens

---------00:37----------
for the desk so now there's no you may

---------00:39----------
notice that there's no more digital zoom

---------00:41----------
this is pure beautiful old style analog

---------00:45----------
zoom and look at how detail this can get

---------00:47----------
if I want do keep in mind this camera is

---------00:50----------
still this is still some piece of crap

---------00:52----------
$480 camera however for 480 bucks this

---------00:57----------
is pretty sweet look at that you get a

---------00:59----------
really nice look at the board from high

---------01:01----------
up and I bet you could even zoom in on

---------01:03----------
individual components on it from here

---------01:08----------
somebody said it's slow yeah but I can

---------01:11----------
make the servo faster look at that look

---------01:14----------
at this like you can solder with this so

---------01:16----------
this board looks pretty nasty so that's

---------01:18----------
the board on the desk let's figure out

---------01:20----------
why this thing doesn't have a green

---------01:21----------
light so when I take a charger and I

---------01:27----------
plug it in as you can see there's no

---------01:31----------
light on the charger see that no light

---------01:35----------
look at that InFocus MagSafe right there

---------01:37----------
so there's no light in the charger now

---------01:39----------
if we have no light in the charger

---------01:40----------
that's typically because bad SMC bad DC

---------01:44----------
and board missing pg3 before to SMC not

---------01:47----------
turning on so let's just get the

---------01:50----------
multimeter in place and see if pp3

---------01:52----------
before 2 is present on this model board

---------01:54----------
so this is the adapter this is the way

---------01:57----------
the adapter plugs into the board 18

---------01:59----------
volts is going to go to the Machine

---------02:01----------
adapter sense is where the sense line

---------02:04----------
from the adapter is going to speak to

---------02:06----------
the Machine so this is how the computer

---------02:08----------
tells that the adapter is connected

---------02:09----------
sends adapter that's going to go to the

---------02:12----------
SMC on the Syst

---------02:13----------
one wire line this chip is going to

---------02:15----------
decide whether or not adapter sense gets

---------02:18----------
to talk to the SMC

---------02:19----------
if this DC and board dies and it decides

---------02:21----------
instead of sending adapter since the

---------02:23----------
computer wants to send 18 volts because

---------02:24----------
it's an evil doctor robotnik DC and

---------02:27----------
board this chip is gonna say nah bro fu

---------02:29----------
you're not going to my SMC in order for

---------02:32----------
this trip to work it needs it's VCC

---------02:33----------
voltage on SM which is sm c bc AC okay

---------02:36----------
VCC and that's going to come from you

---------02:38----------
seventy seven thousand one which if PP

---------02:42----------
three before two is present and sm c bc

---------02:44----------
AC okay is present will take PP three

---------02:45----------
before two and shoot it through so you

---------02:47----------
need PP three before two first for any

---------02:48----------
of this stuff to function so let's see

---------02:51----------
if we have PB three before two on this

---------02:52----------
board so we're gonna see it's right

---------02:54----------
there let's let's find it

---------02:57----------
ah that's killing my eyes headache ow

---------03:00----------
much headache it looks like we get 0

---------03:05----------
volts on PP 3 before 2 so let's turn the

---------03:08----------
charger off for a moment and see if

---------03:09----------
there's a short 2 grounds on PP 3 before

---------03:11----------
- because it's short to ground the pp 3

---------03:12----------
before ii would mess up my whole system

---------03:14----------
and it seems like we don't have a short

---------03:16----------
to ground we have 3.9 kilohms which is a

---------03:19----------
little on the high side i mean a little

---------03:20----------
on the low side a little on the low side

---------03:22----------
but still it works are you sponsored by

---------03:25----------
Paul Daniels or is that have kindness

---------03:26----------
that you keep advertising it I have not

---------03:29----------
been paid by Paul Daniels I just chill

---------03:32----------
it because it's really good software

---------03:33----------
have you know here's the thing

---------03:35----------
trial and Reks test link then try Paul

---------03:38----------
Daniels is software and you tell me that

---------03:40----------
you wouldn't become a lifetime

---------03:41----------
evangelist because to keep in mind

---------03:43----------
Lander X test link has been in there

---------03:45----------
since 1995 it has not been updated in 23

---------03:49----------
years Paul Daniels and clora died where

---------03:52----------
the two people end and PR enough that

---------03:54----------
came by and saved us from that garbage

---------03:57----------
land rex oft where and i remember the

---------03:59----------
people that remember me so that's that

---------04:03----------
I'm loyal to those that helped me so PP

---------04:06----------
3 before 2 is missing let's just browse

---------04:08----------
over to the pit B 3 before to circuit

---------04:10----------
down here and let's so if there's no

---------04:12----------
short to ground so let's see if the

---------04:13----------
voltage in is coming to my chip this

---------04:16----------
chip is going to create the pit B 3

---------04:18----------
before to C right over here on output is

---------04:20----------
d 3 before 2 and it says down here 3.42

---------04:25----------
volt

---------04:26----------
g 3 hot supply

---------04:27----------
so let's see if I'm g3 hot poor g3 not

---------04:31----------
no I wish I could go back in time and

---------04:33----------
undo that that was terrible so let's see

---------04:36----------
what we get on pin 6 so pin 6 of you 70

---------04:39----------
90 now one thing that I can do in Paul

---------04:41----------
Daniels is amazing software is

---------04:42----------
right-click and when I right-click it'll

---------04:45----------
bring me straight to the chip I can

---------04:47----------
click on pin 6 and check the voltage

---------04:49----------
available immediately thanks to the

---------04:50----------
beauty of Paul Daniels is multimeter

---------04:52----------
software not only can I show you exactly

---------04:54----------
where that is on the board but I can

---------04:56----------
show you the measurement on screen

---------04:57----------
without having to read it out removing

---------04:59----------
any possibility that I'm dishonestly

---------05:02----------
giving you random voltages just to

---------05:04----------
pretend that I'm fixing warts

---------05:05----------
not only does Paul Daniels of software

---------05:07----------
make my life easier it also keeps us

---------05:09----------
honest so as you can see we have 0 volts

---------05:14----------
on input why do we have zero volts on

---------05:17----------
input why is that not turning on well

---------05:19----------
you never know maybe there's a short to

---------05:21----------
ground on input as you can see we've got

---------05:24----------
three capacitors that go to ground on

---------05:26----------
this rail on the input two 3.42 volt

---------05:30----------
supply so I'm gonna turn off the charger

---------05:34----------
and check to see if there's a short to

---------05:36----------
ground on PP 3 before 2 input and it

---------05:39----------
seems like open line so that's not it

---------05:42----------
that's not it at all so it looks like we

---------05:45----------
have 0 volts at this point now we're

---------05:48----------
gonna keep checking our way back we

---------05:50----------
could check over here behind the diode

---------05:52----------
we could check here behind the resistor

---------05:54----------
but and then we can check here and here

---------05:56----------
and here and that's a big waste

---------05:58----------
of time because let's say that the issue

---------06:00----------
is that we don't have 18 volts up here

---------06:02----------
then I'm screwing myself so what I need

---------06:04----------
to do is instead of checking over here

---------06:07----------
and there and there and there I checked

---------06:09----------
at the end now I'm gonna check around

---------06:11----------
the beginning so it looks like J 7,000

---------06:15----------
is the DCN board the charging port for

---------06:18----------
the machine and we are going to run

---------06:21----------
through and see if this there right in

---------06:22----------
the beginning right where that fuses so

---------06:24----------
let's check it f7 0 0 5 at the DCN fuse

---------06:28----------
the one part of a Macbook that's never

---------06:30----------
gonna break because it's supposed to so

---------06:33----------
let's check at the fuse so it looks like

---------06:35----------
we get 18 volts as expected the fuse is

---------06:38----------
not blown why would the DC in fuse blow

---------06:40----------
and there's a problem

---------06:41----------
two macbook fuses are not supposed to

---------06:43----------
blow in a macbook so we're gonna

---------06:45----------
continue on to the end see where the

---------06:48----------
problem lies now if you follow this

---------06:51----------
it seems that 18 volts is going to show

---------06:53----------
up on q70 10 q70 10 is a transistor

---------06:56----------
that's going to open and allow voltage

---------06:59----------
through to my PIPA 3 before 2 circuit so

---------07:01----------
let's check out where q70 10 is and

---------07:03----------
let's see what we get on the source pin

---------07:05----------
5 and the drain pin one source is pin 5

---------07:09----------
and drain is pin 1 to whatever this is

---------07:15----------
now as you can see the transistor on the

---------07:18----------
board view is tall like a basketball

---------07:22----------
player and the transistor on the board

---------07:23----------
is wide like a reddit / r / phat logic

---------07:27----------
wider than it is tall so what I'm gonna

---------07:29----------
do is I'm gonna check we're gonna click

---------07:31----------
on pin 5 because I want to see what's on

---------07:33----------
input and I don't know what pin 5 is I

---------07:35----------
don't know where that is but I do know

---------07:36----------
that that attaches to these two things

---------07:38----------
next to it and those two things I know

---------07:40----------
where they are tall thingy tiny thingy

---------07:43----------
and over there we get 18 volts 18 volts

---------07:49----------
so next up we're going to check the

---------07:54----------
output the output is pin 1 and this kind

---------07:57----------
of looks like pin 1 because it has 2 1 3

---------08:00----------
all over it and that attaches to things

---------08:04----------
like our 70 20 pin 1 and our 70 20 pin 1

---------08:07----------
is over here and that is the drain and

---------08:12----------
we get 0 volts which means this

---------08:14----------
transistor is not open now this is a

---------08:16----------
p-channel transistor which means that

---------08:17----------
this transistor is going to open when

---------08:19----------
the voltage on the gate and the gate

---------08:21----------
over here is pin 4 see where it says G G

---------08:24----------
stands for gate is lower than the source

---------08:28----------
which is s source and 5 now there is a

---------08:32----------
couple of reasons that this could be

---------08:33----------
this circuit in its default state is

---------08:36----------
supposed to have about 5 volts on the

---------08:38----------
gate 5 or 10 volts and you could tell

---------08:40----------
that because there's this voltage

---------08:41----------
divider here a voltage divider is going

---------08:43----------
to be a resistor between the high

---------08:44----------
voltage where you want the lower voltage

---------08:46----------
to be and another resistor between what

---------08:48----------
you want the voltage to be in ground and

---------08:49----------
the person who wants an explanation as

---------08:51----------
to why this board doesn't work just ran

---------08:53----------
away

---------08:54----------
in turn oh well it he could watch

---------08:58----------
the video when it comes out anyway so

---------09:00----------
this here is gonna act as a voltage

---------09:03----------
divider our seventy ten and then D

---------09:07----------
seventy 10 so you're gonna have some of

---------09:09----------
the voltage go to the gate of the

---------09:11----------
resistor some of the voltage will go to

---------09:13----------
the gate of the resistor but the rest

---------09:14----------
will go to ground that's what this diode

---------09:17----------
does D seventy 10 now there's two

---------09:19----------
possibilities as to why the voltage and

---------09:21----------
the source and the gate are the same

---------09:22----------
behind door number will actually three

---------09:24----------
possibly behind door number one q70 ten

---------09:26----------
is internally shorted the source is

---------09:27----------
short it's of the gate behind door

---------09:29----------
number two this capacitor that sits

---------09:31----------
between the source and the gate is

---------09:32----------
shorted behind door number three the

---------09:34----------
diode is bad now we can figure out a Phi

---------09:36----------
if one or two of the case by measuring

---------09:38----------
the resistance between the source and

---------09:40----------
the gate if we have a low resistance

---------09:42----------
between the source and the gate then we

---------09:44----------
know the cause of the problem so c7 t12

---------09:46----------
is between the source and the gate of

---------09:48----------
the transistor so I'm gonna right-click

---------09:50----------
it and see if it shows up on the board

---------09:52----------
we're gonna measure then what resistance

---------09:55----------
to begin we get 110 kilohm so that's not

---------09:57----------
the case

---------09:58----------
likely the case is the diode is bad or

---------10:01----------
missing so let's check with it let's

---------10:03----------
check the diode because if the diode is

---------10:04----------
missing then the voltage is going to be

---------10:06----------
a little bit too high on the gate it's

---------10:10----------
not gonna be any way to lower it

---------10:11----------
so let's we're gonna zoom in on the

---------10:13----------
diode and get a nice good look at this

---------10:15----------
little bastard

---------10:36----------
the left pad looks messed up to me

---------10:39----------
inside the scope it looks more it's hard

---------10:42----------
for me to hold it okay so we're gonna

---------10:44----------
wipe that off the board and after that

---------10:47----------
everything's gonna work again yeah just

---------10:54----------
transistors is all all you got to do is

---------10:56----------
you have to trace back each point so we

---------10:59----------
open this to full screen yeah so you

---------11:05----------
don't you're missing PP 3 before - so

---------11:07----------
you're getting voltage into it no so

---------11:10----------
you're getting voltage here no you're

---------11:13----------
getting both the cheer know you're

---------11:14----------
getting voltage here no see you chase it

---------11:16----------
back are you getting voltage here no are

---------11:18----------
you getting both the cheer yes ah hmm

---------11:21----------
problem here okay what is this thing

---------11:23----------
what is this - that's a transistor okay

---------11:25----------
how does it open

---------11:26----------
well you go if you don't know how it

---------11:28----------
opens you Google so you Google and after

---------11:32----------
you Google you realize that this is a

---------11:34----------
p-channel so we look at this okay so how

---------11:36----------
does it open you gue if you don't know

---------11:38----------
your Google what is this transistor how

---------11:40----------
do okay what type of transistor how does

---------11:42----------
it open blah blah blah so the voltage in

---------11:44----------
the gate is to be lower than the source

---------11:45----------
okay what is the voltage in the gate

---------11:46----------
same as the source okay so now you have

---------11:47----------
it you have identified the cause and the

---------11:49----------
fault of your problem what do you do

---------11:51----------
from there okay well how is this going

---------11:53----------
to get lowered well there's a ground

---------11:55----------
over here

---------11:56----------
your first thing you have to do is

---------11:57----------
figure out what it was they were trying

---------11:58----------
to do so when you look at that circuit

---------11:59----------
you have to configure what they're

---------12:01----------
trying to do is get the voltage in the

---------12:02----------
gate to be lower so how do you get the

---------12:04----------
voltage and they get to be lower ground

---------12:05----------
what's the pathway to ground here in

---------12:07----------
here so you'd measure this resistor

---------12:08----------
resistor good resistor good diode mad so

---------12:14----------
I have faith that you'd have figured

---------12:16----------
this out on your own

---------12:16----------
this would have taken a little bit of

---------12:18----------
time yeah and even if you didn't notice

---------12:22----------
the pad it would it would have get

---------12:24----------
narrowed down to that little diode just

---------12:27----------
by process of elimination

---------12:36----------
all right diode is gone now before I do

---------12:38----------
too much I'd like to examine what that

---------12:40----------
looks like underneath and man looks like

---------12:42----------
one of those pads is missing

---------12:53----------
alright so the left pad seems to be

---------12:56----------
problematic so the right pad is good the

---------13:03----------
left pad see a little bit of gentle

---------13:05----------
scraping and it looks nice again that's

---------13:12----------
all I needed and man you wouldn't you

---------13:15----------
would have probably never seen that upon

---------13:17----------
first look and here's what's interesting

---------13:18----------
if you actually take a look at this

---------13:20----------
entire board and this is that this is

---------13:21----------
the fun part that I told him right

---------13:23----------
before we started you would think that

---------13:25----------
this was the problem that and this is by

---------13:28----------
the way this is after cleaning this is

---------13:30----------
after I took a q-tip to it some alcohol

---------13:32----------
you'd think that this is the problem the

---------13:34----------
area that's clearly corroded and nasty

---------13:36----------
and disgusting but the actual problem

---------13:39----------
with the board has to do with the spot

---------13:40----------
that has zero corrosion on it whatsoever

---------13:43----------
and no visible signs of damage without

---------13:46----------
actually taking something off so this is

---------13:49----------
one of those really fun cases where the

---------13:50----------
thing that's actually wrong is the part

---------13:51----------
that you'd never guess was wrong yeah I

---------13:57----------
mean there was corrosion on this thing

---------13:58----------
over here

---------14:00----------
yeah but the actual part that was

---------14:03----------
damaged was the part that didn't look

---------14:05----------
corroded this is this board was a this

---------14:08----------
board was a bit of a troll alright so

---------14:10----------
now I just need to get myself another

---------14:11----------
diode

---------14:27----------
don't run away little diode

---------15:02----------
let's see how bad did we burn the DCN

---------15:05----------
board not that bad

---------15:07----------
that's a nice-looking dcn board barely

---------15:11----------
got burned yeah it's lovely

---------15:35----------
plug it in turn on the power supply and

---------15:38----------
we have a light and we also have a fan

---------15:42----------
spin meanwhile there's no fan so you

---------15:44----------
can't see the fan spin but it's drawing

---------15:46----------
point six amps and if I check you'll

---------15:49----------
also notice that I'm getting CPU vcore

---------15:51----------
so watch yeah I'll show you prove it to

---------15:53----------
you I'll prove it to you that this thing

---------15:54----------
is on and running look at that

---------15:57----------
CPU vcore one point eight six seven

---------15:59----------
volts that's it for today and as always

---------16:01----------
I hope you learned something

---------16:10----------
you

---------16:14----------
I'm such a headache

---------16:23----------
must record content must edit video must

---------16:28----------
respond such criticism have not enough

---------16:30----------
good content on main channel must find

---------16:33----------
somebody to edit video I usually have it

---------16:38----------
just in this last week my head's been

---------16:39----------
killing me so I haven't edited any video

---------16:42----------
so instead of editing video I've been

---------16:44----------
uploading bug videos and people have

---------16:46----------
been raging apparently when you create

---------16:48----------
content that's based on electronics

---------16:50----------
repair and engineering and then you'd

---------16:51----------
replace that content with zooming in on

---------16:53----------
bugs people get mad imagine that okay

---------16:58----------
let's see does this work are we live hey

---------17:02----------
it looks like we're live okay so I have

---------17:04----------
to pretend they don't have a headache

---------17:05----------
anymore so today we're gonna be working

---------17:07----------
on an 8 - 0 - 4 9 - 4 board that's not

---------17:10----------
turning on my useless assistant here

---------17:21----------
you
