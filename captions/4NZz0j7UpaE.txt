---------00:00----------
okay so today I'm gonna be going over a

---------00:01----------
macbook air boy that's not turning on

---------00:03----------
this is an eight to zero dash 3209 I

---------00:05----------
want to go over a little bit of the

---------00:07----------
troubleshooting process how I figure out

---------00:08----------
what's wrong with it so this board has

---------00:10----------
already been through an ultrasonic

---------00:11----------
cleaner it came in for liquid damage

---------00:13----------
from my friend Sonny who has taken my

---------00:17----------
practical board repair course no less

---------00:20----------
than three times already which is why

---------00:22----------
I'm a little fed up this is here but I

---------00:26----------
digress

---------00:27----------
so let's get started on what's wrong

---------00:30----------
with it so the first thing that I like

---------00:31----------
to do with any of these boards as I like

---------00:33----------
to talk about you know what I call the

---------00:34----------
Holy Trinity of MacBook power which is

---------00:37----------
12 volts 5 volts and 3 volts or in this

---------00:40----------
case it's going to be 8 volts 5 volts

---------00:42----------
and 3 volts so these boards have three

---------00:44----------
main voltage rails which is pp bus g3

---------00:47----------
hot which is twelve point six volts or

---------00:48----------
eight volts in an air pp 3 v 4 2 which

---------00:51----------
is the three point 42 volt power line

---------00:53----------
you need up for the one wire circuit to

---------00:54----------
work and then you have the 5 volt rail

---------00:57----------
so PP 5 es 4 is 4 PP 5vs5 or PP 5 es 3

---------01:01----------
whatever it is in your particular

---------01:02----------
machine so in this machine I check for

---------01:04----------
PP bus g3 hot and my multimeter is

---------01:07----------
telling me that I have 8.3 good I have

---------01:11----------
an orange light in the charger so

---------01:13----------
obviously I have my pp 3 v mi PPE 3 V 4

---------01:17----------
2 now let's check for other voltages on

---------01:19----------
this board okay at this point I'm going

---------01:21----------
to check for PP 5 vs 3 so let's see

---------01:26----------
where that is so I check and I look over

---------01:29----------
here and of course the board is in a

---------01:32----------
different orientation than it is to make

---------01:33----------
aah hurts my brain let's say so I have

---------01:39----------
right over here I'm gonna check ok so I

---------01:44----------
do have PP 5 vs 3 now I'm also

---------01:48----------
interested in what state I'm in so if I

---------01:49----------
f PP 5 es 3 the machine is clearly

---------01:51----------
making it to an S 3 state now I may be

---------01:55----------
interested to see if it's in an Esso

---------01:57----------
state but mean because the DIA and the

---------01:59----------
air the newer air is all these core i5

---------02:01----------
platforms they're supposed to turn on as

---------02:03----------
soon as you plug the charger and it's

---------02:04----------
not like it waits for you to hit the

---------02:06----------
power button to turn it on so let's see

---------02:08----------
what I got I get 4 PP 5 eso

---------02:13----------
all right also if you want to know where

---------02:15----------
I'm finding these lists of voltage rails

---------02:18----------
if you erased it if you want to see

---------02:21----------
where I'm finding this list of all the

---------02:22----------
drills it's actually right here in the

---------02:24----------
schematic make sure there we go yeah so

---------02:28----------
you're gonna see a page that lists all

---------02:30----------
the voltage rails and the voltage that

---------02:31----------
you should expect to see at that

---------02:32----------
particular location and you'll learn

---------02:35----------
over time which ones you want to check

---------02:37----------
first and which ones you want to check

---------02:38----------
later so now that I've checked PP 5vs5

---------02:48----------
PP 5 es 3 let's check PP 5 es o because

---------02:52----------
if I have that voltage then that means

---------02:53----------
that the computer itself is turning on

---------02:55----------
and it means that I need to figure out

---------02:57----------
what a so voltage is missing so PP 5 ESO

---------03:02----------
is present I have five point zero four

---------03:05----------
volts there that means that the machine

---------03:06----------
itself is in an Esso state which means

---------03:09----------
that I have an SL power rail that is

---------03:11----------
missing so let's see which SL power rail

---------03:13----------
is missing so there are different states

---------03:15----------
for the machine as five off as three

---------03:17----------
sleeping s ou on so this machine right

---------03:21----------
now believe it or not it's actually on

---------03:23----------
the fan isn't spinning nothing shows up

---------03:25----------
on the screen but there are voltage

---------03:26----------
rails on for it to be on it wants to be

---------03:28----------
on so let's look for PP 3 V 3 s Oh make

---------03:32----------
sure open broadcaster is still recording

---------03:34----------
here okay people where can I measure PP

---------03:39----------
3 v 3s Oh

---------03:47----------
but it turned the board around again

---------03:49----------
roar

---------04:04----------
pp 3 B 3 s I was there okay let's go to

---------04:08----------
the next one so the next s over line is

---------04:10----------
going to be P p1 v8 underscore s all

---------04:13----------
underscore reg pp 1 v8 underscore s so

---------04:17----------
where does that show up ok this shows up

---------04:19----------
over let's see where is that power line

---------04:26----------
ok shows up over here so I go to measure

---------04:30----------
and I seen one point seven eight and a

---------04:38----------
little bit of corrosion and the machine

---------04:43----------
itself actually just turned on it's

---------04:45----------
pretty interesting because this was not

---------04:48----------
turning on before it was actually dead

---------04:49----------
this is pretty interesting let's show

---------04:57----------
you that area

---------05:03----------
so this does this look like stuff that I

---------05:06----------
want to keep here so keep in mind I'm

---------05:08----------
missing an SL power rail that's why this

---------05:10----------
board is here I'm missing an Esso line

---------05:12----------
and this is what one of my lines

---------05:15----------
looks like so what I'm gonna do right

---------05:17----------
now again this is kind of funny because

---------05:18----------
this board did not work and as soon as I

---------05:20----------
went to measure it showed up and it

---------05:21----------
worked which is really funny because the

---------05:24----------
fan was actually spinning it was not

---------05:26----------
spinning just just a second ago

---------05:34----------
that is funny and the preliminary tests

---------05:37----------
also showed that it was missing an S oh

---------05:39----------
wow and it's decided to start working

---------05:42----------
because I was filming it it's pretty

---------05:44----------
cool cuz this was dead like I mean I

---------05:47----------
know people are not gonna believe me now

---------05:48----------
but does this was dead before hey

---------05:50----------
what I'm not making this up oh man well

---------05:54----------
I made the point I'm trying to get

---------05:55----------
across here that was supposed to

---------05:57----------
measure zero a point I'm trying to get

---------06:01----------
across here is if you see that you're in

---------06:04----------
an Esso state meaning that you have SL

---------06:06----------
power rails showing up on your machine

---------06:16----------
you

---------07:22----------
all right you have a nice day man all

---------07:27----------
right

---------07:36----------
my soldering goes downhill terribly when

---------07:38----------
I'm trying to multitask and sell a

---------07:41----------
douchebag while simultaneously soldering

---------07:43----------
so yes so the world war was okay so this

---------07:46----------
was missing an Esso rail because I knew

---------07:49----------
that much because it was in an Esso

---------07:51----------
state but it wasn't on and I know that

---------07:53----------
from the moment I plugged this

---------07:54----------
charger and that the fan wasn't spinning

---------07:56----------
I know that much and I know that when he

---------08:00----------
brought it that the fan wasn't spending

---------08:01----------
because I was actually at his shop

---------08:03----------
trolling him on what could potentially

---------08:04----------
be wrong with this board and I know that

---------08:07----------
it was dead I know that the other guy

---------08:09----------
here put it on my desk because it was

---------08:11----------
dead and when I decide to put it up to

---------08:13----------
start doing a video and I get to

---------08:15----------
the rail that was most likely the one

---------08:17----------
that didn't work they decided to turn on

---------08:18----------
I have no explanation for this but

---------08:22----------
it's how it works

---------08:23----------
it really is it just it's set up to make

---------08:25----------
me look like an idiot

---------08:26----------
all the time anyway it was just another

---------08:32----------
10-minute phone call with somebody that

---------08:34----------
wants to know why I can't fix their

---------08:36----------
motherboard and guarantee your

---------08:38----------
motherboard repair inside of less than a

---------08:40----------
day and that's the thing like this is a

---------08:42----------
pretty good chance that I actually can

---------08:43----------
do that stuff pretty quickly it's just

---------08:45----------
just just don't start doing that

---------08:47----------
where you're like trying to get me to

---------08:48----------
guarantee it cuz that's just that's not

---------08:51----------
gonna happen I mean that's all I have to

---------08:54----------
say there so this little resistor is

---------08:57----------
gone and oh boy it looks like it goes to

---------09:00----------
something that's gonna be a to get

---------09:03----------
a wire going to so are 79 86 that pad is

---------09:06----------
 and that's not gonna be a fun

---------09:09----------
thing to run a wire to I just know that

---------09:12----------
that's gonna be a signal that I'm not

---------09:13----------
gonna find anywhere other than near the

---------09:14----------
CPU or something so p.m. p1 v8s oen so

---------09:19----------
here is the problem so let me let me let

---------09:21----------
me explain what was going on here let me

---------09:23----------
explain why guy took my course three

---------09:26----------
times still breaking ports to me

---------09:28----------
remember when I said check your power

---------09:30----------
rails to see what's not turning on this

---------09:33----------
page tells you all the power wells that

---------09:35----------
should be present in your machine so

---------09:36----------
when you go to this page over here

---------09:38----------
you should check every single one of

---------09:40----------
these with your multimeter and if one is

---------09:41----------
not showing up then you should go to

---------09:42----------
that area and see why and when I went to

---------09:47----------
that area for

---------09:48----------
pp1 VA de sol i see a huge honking thing

---------09:52----------
of water right over here right by the

---------09:55----------
Enable now just to be safe

---------09:56----------
just to be safe so this doesn't

---------09:58----------
come back I did replace this chip and

---------09:59----------
there was a good chance of that chip

---------10:00----------
itself was actually fine I replaced it

---------10:02----------
just to be safe the most likely issue

---------10:04----------
here was that this big pile of green

---------10:06----------
 on the Enable was keeping p.m.

---------10:08----------
sleep s 3rl from going to the p1 v8 s Oh

---------10:13----------
enable of the chip this chip was not

---------10:15----------
being told to turn on there was no

---------10:16----------
voltage at the enable because the sleep

---------10:17----------
signal p.m. sleep s 3 RL which I have to

---------10:20----------
find out on a wire to that resistor was

---------10:23----------
not getting to that chip and oh wow this

---------10:26----------
is pretty nice there's actually a probe

---------10:27----------
point here where I can grab that

---------10:28----------
resistor - what's up Tashi

---------10:31----------
all right so I was being bothered

---------10:33----------
non-stop yesterday so unfortunately I

---------10:35----------
wasn't able to do the soldering on

---------10:36----------
camera on the weekend instead of having

---------10:38----------
my regular staff here I have one

---------10:40----------
part-timer and just about any time

---------10:43----------
somebody wants to give them a hard time

---------10:45----------
for no reason because they can kind of

---------10:47----------
sense that somebody who is not the owner

---------10:50----------
is there they will just dig their claws

---------10:52----------
and and I just had a help with that and

---------10:56----------
since I had to keep answering the phone

---------10:57----------
I didn't have time to show you how this

---------10:59----------
was done so anyway so what I wound up

---------11:01----------
doing here to make this work is I

---------11:03----------
scraped away where that resistor was

---------11:06----------
where that was messed up so let me just

---------11:08----------
show you that on here on the on the

---------11:10----------
board view software I me just open up

---------11:11----------
the board view software and switch it

---------11:13----------
over so that you could see what it is

---------11:14----------
I'm talking about so as I said the

---------11:16----------
problem was that this chip was not being

---------11:18----------
told to turn on at the area just kind of

---------11:20----------
look like

---------11:21----------
let's just fine the chip here we go so

---------11:23----------
right over here where p1 v8s oen is p1

---------11:28----------
VA de sol en that is created from PM

---------11:31----------
sleep s 3 RL and this pad over here was

---------11:34----------
gone and that area looked like complete

---------11:35----------
 so I kept scraping and scraping and

---------11:38----------
scraping away and eventually I saw there

---------11:40----------
was a very very small little piece of

---------11:41----------
copper that I could solder it to and

---------11:43----------
when I did that the board turned on and

---------11:44----------
worked but I didn't want to necessarily

---------11:46----------
trust that that was going to be enough

---------11:47----------
so what I did is I put a wire from where

---------11:52----------
p.m. sleep s whatever was and I ran a

---------11:55----------
wire to that point so if that pad just

---------11:57----------
so happens to fail which I doubt it will

---------11:59----------
but if the pad just so happens to fail I

---------12:01----------
now have a

---------12:02----------
why are there and let me just show you

---------12:03----------
what the wire looks like and the

---------12:05----------
microscope so yeah I also conformal

---------12:09----------
coded it so that I wouldn't have to

---------12:11----------
worry about the thing moving around and

---------12:12----------
after I could inform oh yeah so after I

---------12:14----------
did all the soldering I put it in the

---------12:16----------
ultrasonic cleaner after the ultrasonic

---------12:18----------
cleaner I put it in the alcohol then I

---------12:19----------
put it in the oven to get rid of any of

---------12:22----------
the residue after the oven I applied the

---------12:24----------
conformal coating then I put it back in

---------12:26----------
the oven to cure and this is what it

---------12:28----------
looks like so yeah it's it's kind of a

---------12:32----------
pile of green but it's a pile of

---------12:34----------
green that I don't have to worry

---------12:35----------
about so you know let's say this wire

---------12:37----------
here do you know something touches it

---------12:38----------
the wire doesn't move like over here I

---------12:41----------
touched and the wire is not you know

---------12:43----------
it's not moving I'll have to worry about

---------12:45----------
the wire moving I don't worry about

---------12:46----------
things coming off which is a great part

---------12:48----------
of conformal coating and I green wire

---------12:50----------
this whole thing all the way over there

---------12:52----------
so it's a big ole mess of green and just

---------12:55----------
to go back to the schematic to reiterate

---------12:56----------
what it is I did so let's go back over

---------12:59----------
here to the schematic for this

---------13:00----------
particular model and open it up in full

---------13:03----------
screen so that it's easy to see okay so

---------13:09----------
Sonny said check Q 7950 so what I want

---------13:12----------
to do here is I want to look and see

---------13:13----------
just how close Sonny was to being right

---------13:15----------
so Q 7950 is a logic gate for the Esso

---------13:19----------
rail P good circuit so what this does is

---------13:22----------
if P P 3v3 s o is present pp 1 B 5 s 3

---------13:26----------
RS o is present and P P 1 vo 5 s o over

---------13:29----------
here is present if those three signals

---------13:31----------
are present you get all system power

---------13:33----------
good and all system power good is one of

---------13:36----------
the signals that is required in order

---------13:37----------
for the Machine actually turn on so you

---------13:39----------
were very very close you noticed that

---------13:41----------
your machine is not giving you an S o P

---------13:43----------
good which means that something is wrong

---------13:45----------
with the s o States OS l rails are

---------13:48----------
coming on but you notice that you're

---------13:49----------
missing all system power good and you

---------13:51----------
were on the right track the problem is

---------13:53----------
that after noticing that your s l rails

---------13:55----------
were not there one of the done one of

---------13:58----------
the right things to do would have been

---------13:59----------
to go to page seven of the schematic

---------14:00----------
here and when you go to page seven of

---------14:02----------
the schematic you'll get a list of power

---------14:07----------
rails and you should have went through

---------14:09----------
and checked every single one of your s l

---------14:10----------
rails let's see which one is missing

---------14:11----------
again when your machine is not working

---------14:13----------
go through this list and go

---------14:16----------
to the rails and then when you figure it

---------14:17----------
and then try to figure out why one of

---------14:18----------
them is not working if one of them is

---------14:20----------
missing so if you're missing one go to

---------14:21----------
that area is there corrosion is it not

---------14:23----------
being told to turn on is another chip

---------14:25----------
not sending the signal that's needed for

---------14:27----------
that to turn on and over here when I got

---------14:29----------
to P P One V ADA so I decided let me see

---------14:32----------
where P P 1 V ADA so is created and I

---------14:36----------
hit enter on here a few times and

---------14:38----------
eventually it brings me to a page where

---------14:40----------
I get to see what chip is responsible

---------14:42----------
for creating P P 1 v8s oh and what's

---------14:46----------
responsible for creating PP 1 v8s Oh is

---------14:48----------
you 7720 I decided let me look on the

---------14:50----------
microscope for where you 7720 s which

---------14:53----------
means in the board view I type C then I

---------14:55----------
tell you 7720 this is gonna tell me

---------14:57----------
where you 7720 is and then when I zoomed

---------14:59----------
in on it in the microscope I noticed

---------15:01----------
that it looked like complete now

---------15:03----------
one of the things you're also going to

---------15:03----------
notice here is that P P 1 v ADA so is

---------15:05----------
responsible for creating P P 1 vo v so

---------15:09----------
let's see how P P 1 V 8 s o is required

---------15:11----------
for creating P P 1 vo 5 P P 1 vo 5 now

---------15:15----------
check the sound queue let's see you said

---------15:18----------
that Q 7950 was the one that you were

---------15:22----------
suspect of so P P 1 vo 5 is one of the

---------15:25----------
voltages that's required for all system

---------15:27----------
power good one of the other things that

---------15:28----------
I keep telling you is if power L is

---------15:30----------
missing

---------15:31----------
don't just troubleshoot that power L

---------15:32----------
check the power rail above it so for

---------15:34----------
example if P P 5vs5 is missing see if

---------15:37----------
you have P P bunch D 3 hot first if your

---------15:39----------
5 volt rail is missing then check the 12

---------15:41----------
volt rail to see if the 12 volts RL is

---------15:43----------
there the 5 volt rail is created from

---------15:45----------
the 12 volt rail so if your 12 volt rail

---------15:47----------
is missing your 5 volt circuitry can be

---------15:49----------
perfectly fine but it's not actually

---------15:50----------
gonna create 5 volts since you're

---------15:51----------
missing the 12 over here you need those

---------15:54----------
three voltage drill so pp 1 B 5 s 3 you

---------15:56----------
need PP 3 V 3 and which are rails that

---------15:58----------
we had any but you don't have P P 1 vo 5

---------16:01----------
I know you don't have P P 1 vo 5 because

---------16:03----------
you don't have P P 1 V 8 you need pp 1 B

---------16:05----------
8 to create P P 1 vo 5 so if you you

---------16:08----------
were very very close you saw that Q 7950

---------16:11----------
is where you is where something messed

---------16:13----------
up for you so you notice that you're not

---------16:14----------
getting all system power good now if you

---------16:16----------
checked here you would see that you have

---------16:17----------
P P 1 V 5 s 3 RSL you would have checked

---------16:20----------
then you would have seen that you had pp

---------16:21----------
3 V 3 s oh but you were missing P P 1 vo

---------16:23----------
5 so you go to P P 1 vo 5

---------16:31----------
and you could see in this diagram over

---------16:34----------
here the PP one bo v is created from PP

---------16:36----------
1 v 8 and this is where the trouble this

---------16:39----------
is where you got stuck in the

---------16:40----------
troubleshooting and sadly this is where

---------16:43----------
having taken 200 bucks for ten minutes

---------16:45----------
of my time but this is where you got

---------16:48----------
stuck and hopefully by seeing it whole

---------16:50----------
you learn and you don't make the same

---------16:52----------
mistake next time is again these

---------16:55----------
mistakes are expensive but that's about

---------16:57----------
that for today and I hope you learned

---------16:59----------
something and oh I have to show that it

---------17:02----------
works don't I I have to show that this

---------17:04----------
thing actually turns on that's a

---------17:06----------
tradition that I have going here that

---------17:08----------
you see that I am NOT just making this

---------17:09----------
 up

---------17:10----------
okay so let's turn it on and see if it

---------17:12----------
works before I give it back to sunny

---------17:22----------
you

---------17:58----------
okay it Dung's after the dong it turns

---------18:01----------
on let's see that this is the machine

---------18:08----------
that Sonny gave me that actually has a

---------18:10----------
dead SSD so you're not gonna see much at

---------18:13----------
this point well let's see if we get to a

---------18:15----------
question mark folder that'll show that
