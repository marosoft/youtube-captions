---------00:00----------
all right so it's time to fix yet

---------00:01----------
another dead macbook let's take a look

---------00:04----------
at this board and see what's going on

---------00:05----------
with it so this is an 8 to 0-0 0

---------00:08----------
875 board this isn't for an a 1708 model

---------00:12----------
MacBook this is one of the Mac books

---------00:14----------
where it doesn't only not have a touch

---------00:16----------
bar but it has USB C charge ports and

---------00:18----------
this is also one of the very few models

---------00:21----------
that I'm pretty sure an engineer at

---------00:22----------
Apple got fired for because as you can

---------00:24----------
tell the SSD is user removable which

---------00:27----------
means that you can actually get your

---------00:28----------
data off of this and dare I say you can

---------00:31----------
upgrade your solid-state drive without

---------00:33----------
having to buy an entirely new machine so

---------00:36----------
I'm confident that somebody at Apple has

---------00:39----------
these being tortured somewhere in their

---------00:41----------
version of Guantanamo Bay for allowing

---------00:43----------
this to get released to the public so

---------00:45----------
let's just go through and I'm gonna find

---------00:48----------
a board view for this beautiful MacBook

---------00:50----------
we're going to plug in my USB C amp

---------00:53----------
meter to see how much power it's taking

---------00:55----------
and then we can get started so the first

---------00:57----------
thing we're gonna do is plug in this USB

---------00:59----------
C amp meter this is gonna tell me how

---------01:01----------
much power it's using and the reason I'm

---------01:03----------
interested in seeing how much power it's

---------01:04----------
using is because that won't give me an

---------01:06----------
idea of where my problem may lie

---------01:08----------
different numbers mean different things

---------01:09----------
so let's see what this thing does with

---------01:12----------
the USB C ammeter alright so it takes 20

---------01:17----------
volts now that tells me a couple of

---------01:19----------
things the first is that pp3 v3

---------01:21----------
underscore g3 hot is present this chip

---------01:24----------
needs PP 3 v3 underscore g3 hot to work

---------01:26----------
and these are the chips that speak to

---------01:28----------
the charger and then request 20 volts

---------01:32----------
now and we also know that those are

---------01:35----------
working now as you can see it's moving

---------01:37----------
back and forth between 10 20 30

---------01:40----------
milliamps 10 milliamps 30 million 10

---------01:42----------
million milliamps 10 milliamps 30

---------01:44----------
milliamps and it's moving back and forth

---------01:46----------
consistently between that which means

---------01:48----------
that most likely we have some sort of

---------01:50----------
short-circuit because what that's doing

---------01:51----------
is its power cycling it's turning on and

---------01:53----------
then realizing oh god I'm turning on

---------01:55----------
when I shouldn't be turning on turn off

---------01:57----------
and it's doing that in a repin a

---------01:59----------
repeating loop so I don't want to

---------02:02----------
necessarily call that boot looping

---------02:03----------
because the machine is not getting far

---------02:04----------
enough to actually boot I would call

---------02:06----------
that power cycling so let's get to work

---------02:10----------
on that so the first thing I'm going to

---------02:11----------
do is turn on Paul Daniel

---------02:13----------
is excellent multimeter software I would

---------02:15----------
highly suggest that you all check out

---------02:17----------
Paul Daniels channel at youtube.com

---------02:19----------
slash nineteen PLD seven three that's

---------02:23----------
nineteen PLD seventy three to watch his

---------02:25----------
content he makes all sorts of amazing

---------02:27----------
software that helps people in the repair

---------02:29----------
community do the jobs that they need to

---------02:30----------
do and he has contributed more to the

---------02:33----------
repair community in terms of software

---------02:35----------
that we use for free than just about

---------02:37----------
anybody else that I know Paul Daniels

---------02:40----------
Paul Daniels a great man all right now

---------02:45----------
we're going to look over this board so

---------02:47----------
the first thing we're gonna do is we're

---------02:48----------
going to go through the power rail so

---------02:50----------
I'm gonna find the power rails page on

---------02:52----------
the schematic and we are going to go

---------02:54----------
through those power routes hi hi I told

---------02:57----------
the girl that he's liked for a long time

---------02:59----------
that he had a crush on her

---------03:00----------
that's all hope but let's all wish hi hi

---------03:03----------
some good luck it's not easy to tell the

---------03:05----------
girl of your dreams that you have a

---------03:06----------
crush on her especially when you're the

---------03:09----------
type of nerd that knows what a PP bus is

---------03:10----------
and whether or not it's g3 huh telling

---------03:13----------
you when you're a guy that knows the

---------03:15----------
difference between twelve point twenty

---------03:16----------
three volts and 12 point 56 volts on

---------03:18----------
your PP bus it's not easy it's not easy

---------03:21----------
out there we should make our own dating

---------03:23----------
app I swear anyway so let's check this

---------03:27----------
out let's see what's going on with all

---------03:29----------
these different rails and figure out

---------03:31----------
which one is causing our power cycling

---------03:32----------
so the first one on the list is pp bus

---------03:34----------
g3 hot now the way this software works I

---------03:37----------
right-click the rail you can't see that

---------03:39----------
because Paul software puts the mouse in

---------03:41----------
the wrong place because it's but yeah so

---------03:43----------
I right click and flex board view is

---------03:45----------
automatically going to show me

---------03:46----------
everywhere it shows up on the screen

---------03:47----------
then I click and then I check to see if

---------03:50----------
the voltage is present and also if it's

---------03:51----------
short it's a ground so I'm gonna be

---------03:53----------
doing this but while I have the the desk

---------03:57----------
of you go up so I mean I didn't memorize

---------03:59----------
what all these points are just so you

---------04:01----------
know I'm looking at the screen and using

---------04:03----------
the software to help so first I'm gonna

---------04:05----------
do is measure the voltage that I get on

---------04:07----------
my pp bus hi is a good dude hi hi has

---------04:11----------
been like taking care of the chat and

---------04:14----------
shilling and just doing all these things

---------04:16----------
and really helping out for a long time

---------04:18----------
so ever so if anybody deserves some good

---------04:20----------
luck in life I'd say it's hi hi

---------04:22----------
alright we have thirteen point zero nine

---------04:25----------
volts on our PP bust

---------04:27----------
next up let's check out PP 5vs5 pp 5vs5

---------04:32----------
is going to be on this capacitor right

---------04:34----------
around here

---------04:41----------
and as can be seen it goes up and down

---------04:49----------
boo okay so we've got a rail that's boot

---------04:52----------
looping which means that we may have a

---------04:54----------
short on one of the rails related to

---------04:55----------
that so the first thing I'm gonna do is

---------04:56----------
try and figure out where that rail comes

---------04:58----------
from so that rail comes from you 7650 so

---------05:03----------
I want to check out what rails use 7650

---------05:06----------
is responsible for making so let's do

---------05:08----------
that so you

---------05:09----------
7650 creates three rails it creates our

---------05:14----------
55 es 4 it creates our pit by 3 B 3 s 5

---------05:18----------
and it creates our Victor 5vs5 so let's

---------05:21----------
see if any of those rails have a short

---------05:23----------
circuit to ground because if any of them

---------05:24----------
in short circuit to ground maybe

---------05:25----------
something's gonna be going wrong with

---------05:26----------
this chip so first thing we're gonna do

---------05:28----------
is check it out our pp5 vs4 or as I like

---------05:34----------
to call it hit the 5 es for depth of 5

---------05:38----------
years

---------05:44----------
we could find that on pin 2 of this chip

---------05:47----------
let's see what happens

---------05:50----------
pin 2

---------06:00----------
pigby 5es 4:14 kilohms to ground they've

---------06:03----------
got no problem man

---------06:04----------
next up we're gonna check out pp 3 v 3s

---------06:07----------
v tip u3 v3 s5 no problem there kilohms

---------06:12----------
the ground no short circuit next up

---------06:15----------
let's check out hip 2 3 B 3 S 4 we could

---------06:19----------
find Pippa 3 B 3 S 4 well let's see

---------06:23----------
where can we get that on this board

---------06:25----------
there's a current sense resistor

---------06:27----------
somewhere over here I think we're there

---------06:29----------
supposed to be a current sense resistor

---------06:31----------
somewhere over here there you go so this

---------06:34----------
pad is where we can check out our pipi 3

---------06:36----------
B 3 S 4 and we have a zero ohm short to

---------06:41----------
ground

---------06:41----------
so definitely 3 v s4 is our problem

---------06:59----------
so let's fix Pippa 3v3 s for let's try

---------07:02----------
and figure out why it's short it's a

---------07:03----------
ground what could possibly be now it's

---------07:06----------
gonna be something over here something

---------07:13----------
on anywhere along this line any one of

---------07:17----------
these things could be happening so what

---------07:21----------
we need to do is we're going to inject

---------07:23----------
some voltage into PP 3 V 3 S 4 and try

---------07:26----------
and figure out what it is that's getting

---------07:27----------
hot and we're also you may use a thermal

---------07:29----------
camera to help us do this I got this

---------07:31----------
thermal camera from Union imager a union

---------07:34----------
repair it works decently well does not

---------07:36----------
work $900 worth of well to be clear I

---------07:38----------
got this thing for free which is why I

---------07:40----------
use it I would not recommend that

---------07:41----------
somebody spend $900 on it but given that

---------07:44----------
it's free it just just so happens to be

---------07:47----------
worth putting on the desk and trying out

---------07:48----------
so let's give that a shot before that I

---------07:52----------
would have probably done something like

---------07:53----------
poured alcohol on the board or I would

---------07:55----------
have used let's say compressed air can

---------07:58----------
and just turned it upside down by the

---------08:00----------
way free spray is very effective but

---------08:02----------
freeze spray usually cost more than

---------08:03----------
compressed air so if you turn a

---------08:05----------
compressed air can upside down you can

---------08:06----------
use it as free spray okay so we're going

---------08:09----------
to do here is inject some voltage so

---------08:17----------
let's get to it

---------08:22----------
so gonna get one wire that goes to my

---------08:27----------
ground on my board and another wire

---------08:30----------
that's gonna get soldered to PP 3 V 3 S

---------08:32----------
4 so on my power supply first thing to

---------08:41----------
do change the output voltage you don't

---------08:43----------
want to put 18 volts into the board I

---------08:45----------
keep it at 18 volts typically because

---------08:47----------
that's the voltage I that is used by the

---------08:51----------
older MacBook for the DCN for the

---------08:54----------
MagSafe okay we're gonna just clip this

---------08:56----------
right here

---------08:58----------
thank you orphan that's very kind of you

---------09:01----------
and the next up is we have the hot wire

---------09:06----------
which is going to go to our pit P 3 B 3

---------09:08----------
S 4 so

---------09:33----------
has landlord fixed the heat yet no

---------09:36----------
however its 66 degrees in New York right

---------09:38----------
now so I don't really care

---------09:41----------
okay so a micro pencil is not gonna

---------09:43----------
really go to this very well so we're

---------09:44----------
going to get the other soldering iron

---------09:49----------
side of this on the board we are going

---------09:51----------
to there we go

---------09:53----------
melts very nicely and get you right

---------09:59----------
there

---------10:05----------
this is some nasty disgusting looking

---------10:07----------
wire so I'm just gonna cut that up a

---------10:08----------
little bit

---------10:14----------
admittedly this is one of my more fun

---------10:16----------
repairs because we get to blow things up

---------10:20----------
I've turned this up to 0.8 volts and

---------10:26----------
it's taking three amps already Wow so

---------10:29----------
this should be a fairly easy short to

---------10:31----------
detect I enjoy blowing things up it's

---------10:33----------
one of the most fun part of the job

---------10:34----------
unless it's the CPU obviously if it's a

---------10:37----------
power rail that goes to a buck converter

---------10:38----------
the powers the CPU or the GPU then you

---------10:40----------
want to lower the voltage so that you

---------10:41----------
don't put too much there so so let's say

---------10:44----------
that let's say that a certain power line

---------10:46----------
is eight volts and let's say that that

---------10:49----------
power line is used by the CPU got buck

---------10:51----------
converter to to make one volt now let's

---------10:54----------
say that that FET that's gonna be doing

---------10:56----------
the switching the slicing to turn that

---------10:57----------
eight volts and a 1 volts is shorted so

---------10:59----------
it's gonna pass everything through now

---------11:01----------
if I put eight volts in there in that

---------11:03----------
FET is shorted I just sent eight volts

---------11:04----------
to my CPU so it's always good to start

---------11:06----------
with a voltage that's at least half of

---------11:08----------
the CPU voltage of the board if you

---------11:09----------
don't know if that is what's going to

---------11:11----------
the CPU here I know that pp 3 B 3 S 4 is

---------11:14----------
not going to the CPU I'm just gonna

---------11:19----------
double check before I say that for sure

---------11:24----------
yeah it's not going to CPU fine

---------11:26----------
and also I'm only injecting point 8

---------11:28----------
volts so there's no way that not that I

---------11:30----------
can actually harm anything that being

---------11:32----------
said that being said we are going to go

---------11:35----------
to the camp the thermal camera so this

---------11:42----------
is my thermal camera software say hello

---------11:44----------
to Sarah Sarah Moore Pepe who puts

---------11:47----------
thermal Pepe on the thermal ski yeah he

---------11:51----------
puts thermal Pepe on the thermal scanner

---------11:52----------
I love thermal Pepe so this is thermal

---------11:55----------
Pepe so let's see what we have here so

---------11:58----------
we're gonna put this into the overprice

---------12:00----------
thermal imager that is cool but totally

---------12:04----------
would not recommend anybody spend $900

---------12:05----------
zone because that's insane and see what

---------12:07----------
happens now on the right side over here

---------12:09----------
it tells me what the maximum temperature

---------12:12----------
is and over here it's telling me that

---------12:14----------
the maximum temperature is 36 Celsius

---------12:16----------
that that's not really

---------12:18----------
exciting me so that means that I

---------12:20----------
probably am not in the area with my

---------12:21----------
short in thermal Pepe agrees with me so

---------12:26----------
now we're gonna go to the other side of

---------12:27----------
the board and see if there's anything

---------12:30----------
that gets super warm and nothing gets

---------12:36----------
super to warm well the only liquid

---------12:41----------
damage that we have is over here wait

---------12:48----------
check this out

---------12:50----------
this is not this may not be internal to

---------12:52----------
the board huh okay so here's one of the

---------12:55----------
questions that I have for this beautiful

---------12:57----------
Chinese software now on the right side

---------12:59----------
of the screen it's supposed to be

---------13:00----------
telling me what the maximum temperature

---------13:02----------
is on the board and it says 44 however

---------13:05----------
when I put my mouse pointer over here it

---------13:07----------
says maximum temperature 89 so perhaps

---------13:09----------
your short was actually visible but the

---------13:11----------
software was trolling it this this cost

---------13:17----------
this cost $900 good thing I didn't pay

---------13:21----------
that much for it alright so it looks

---------13:23----------
like thermal Pepe is telling us that our

---------13:25----------
short is right over here

---------13:27----------
99 Celsius 98 ian is so it looks like

---------13:31----------
it's something over here rather than

---------13:33----------
spending $900 in the thermal camera it's

---------13:35----------
useful if you spend let's say 200 to 400

---------13:38----------
on a microscope even if you're just

---------13:39----------
getting the amps go up se 400 the cheap

---------13:41----------
one that I have in the description that

---------13:43----------
was my start on microscope what this

---------13:50----------
oh it's the cap for sure look at it

---------13:58----------
yeah so that cap was just was gone so

---------14:01----------
the microscope is it to me is a much

---------14:04----------
more valuable tool than the thermal

---------14:05----------
camera and if I were just starting out I

---------14:07----------
would definitely rather put my money

---------14:08----------
into a microscope than a thermal camera

---------14:10----------
and frankly this is the type of short

---------14:14----------
circuit that you could find even without

---------14:15----------
the thermal camera I was just expecting

---------14:17----------
this to be difficult because I've had

---------14:19----------
nothing but difficult miserable touch

---------14:21----------
bars that I've had to go over for the

---------14:23----------
past few days but had I simply looked

---------14:25----------
this over with the microscope I would

---------14:27----------
have saved myself the embarrassment of

---------14:29----------
having to use a thermal camera to find

---------14:31----------
that that's a very easy to find short

---------14:35----------
the thermal camera would not have been

---------14:37----------
necessary for this just a some eyes and

---------14:40----------
a brain brain is important need brain so

---------14:46----------
we're going to take that off

---------14:57----------
bye-bye cap

---------15:14----------
it is still a little bit of burned

---------15:16----------
capacitor that's stuck to that pad let's

---------15:19----------
just try to get that off without

---------15:20----------
knocking into the Wi-Fi chip I'm gonna

---------15:23----------
make a bit of a solder ball and try to

---------15:26----------
drag it off with my solder ball

---------15:34----------
all righty

---------16:00----------
all right let's see if there's any pads

---------16:01----------
left here

---------16:21----------
now it's gonna be time to switch back to

---------16:23----------
our micro pencil this is not gonna

---------16:27----------
really do the job well so we're gonna go

---------16:29----------
back to the micro pencil there we go so

---------16:35----------
see how my iron was able to bring back

---------16:37----------
that pad that I thought was gone that's

---------16:41----------
the magic of the t30 - can tip this is

---------16:45----------
my favorite soldering iron tip I

---------16:46----------
probably should get a fiberglass pen or

---------16:48----------
something like that to scrape the board

---------16:50----------
with but I have much more fun scraping

---------16:51----------
it with this I think Paul has one I

---------16:56----------
always wanted I don't know I think he

---------16:58----------
hides it for me I always wind up just

---------16:59----------
scraping the board with the tip

---------17:10----------
there we go from my Pat's back beautiful

---------18:39----------
I want to minimize the amount of time I

---------18:41----------
spend heating that Wi-Fi chips so I'm

---------18:43----------
going to not really care if it's not

---------18:46----------
soldered in place perfectly because it

---------18:48----------
will get soldered in place perfectly

---------18:49----------
when I do the next chip

---------18:55----------
succumb to gravity mofo yes and so when

---------19:01----------
I put the last piece on there everything

---------19:03----------
else is gonna nicely fall into place

---------19:05----------
since I got the flux on that you'll see

---------19:09----------
it's gonna be beautiful

---------19:29----------
okay go go gadget gravity there you go

---------19:33----------
stay down sometimes it's a pain in the

---------19:36----------
ass when the chip doesn't want to stay

---------19:37----------
down

---------19:58----------
beautiful

---------20:48----------
no Wi-Fi chip is fine beard of joy

---------20:54----------
then give that Wi-Fi chip a happy little

---------20:56----------
reflow

---------21:02----------
what is a good starter Microsoft asked

---------21:04----------
mark if you look in the video

---------21:06----------
description you'll find an AM scope SC

---------21:08----------
400 link which i think is pretty much

---------21:10----------
the the best thing you can get if you're

---------21:12----------
looking for a cheap starter microscope I

---------21:15----------
got mine for a hundred seventy-five

---------21:17----------
bucks

---------21:23----------
now this Wi-Fi chip may have some

---------21:25----------
corrosion under it since that stuff on

---------21:27----------
the bottom had that nasty looking

---------21:28----------
corrosion around it so I we're gonna

---------21:30----------
give it a happy little reflow once it

---------21:33----------
has a happy little reflow it's balls

---------21:34----------
will all be healthy again and it will be

---------21:36----------
making a nice connection to the board

---------21:38----------
it'll be able to communicate with the

---------21:40----------
board and give the board Wi-Fi and the

---------21:44----------
board will give the chip a purpose we're

---------21:50----------
just gonna put a little bit of flux here

---------21:55----------
soldering flux beautiful that's not a

---------22:01----------
lot of flux that's a little bit of flux

---------22:03----------
that's the right amount of flux all

---------22:06----------
right

---------22:54----------
now keep in mind I'm not ready flowing

---------22:56----------
from close up right now this this iron

---------22:58----------
is quite a bit away from the board I

---------23:00----------
guess you can't really tell depth that

---------23:02----------
well on this camera but I'm pretty far

---------23:04----------
away

---------23:08----------
I'm just preheating the area because I

---------23:11----------
want to use a minimal heat when I'm

---------23:12----------
right up on the chip so I preheat the

---------23:14----------
area to a good amount and now I'm gonna

---------23:17----------
go close to it for the kill

---------23:30----------
there we go a little tap

---------23:35----------
tap-tap-tap and now I just wait for it

---------23:38----------
to cool off

---------23:47----------
okay let's see what we get

---------23:54----------
20 volts six hundred milliamps so this

---------23:58----------
is turning on great instead of the

---------24:00----------
heatsink on the CPU we're just not gonna

---------24:02----------
let it stay on for too long but this is

---------24:05----------
indeed now turning on which means that

---------24:07----------
we've made progress so we had a short

---------24:09----------
circuit we figured out that it was most

---------24:11----------
likely a short circuit because when I

---------24:13----------
started going through the power rails

---------24:14----------
one of them was going on off on off on

---------24:16----------
off and typically when it's turning on

---------24:18----------
off on off on off the chip is turning

---------24:20----------
itself off because there's a short

---------24:23----------
upstream now the rail that was going up

---------24:25----------
and down was pp5 es5 and that's on the

---------24:28----------
chip that also creates PP 3 B 3 S 5 so

---------24:30----------
even though PP 3 B 3 S 5 was fine pp 3 B

---------24:33----------
3 S 4 which is upstream was not working

---------24:35----------
and PP 3 v 3 S 4 comes from PP 3 v 3 S 5

---------24:38----------
since the chip that makes PP 3 V 3 s 5 +

---------24:41----------
PP 5 es 5 are the same chip even though

---------24:44----------
PP 3 V 3 S 4 was an issue

---------24:46----------
it was stopping PP 5 es 5 from working

---------24:48----------
because these rails are essentially

---------24:50----------
created by the same chip and if the chip

---------24:52----------
realizes it's a problem on any one of

---------24:53----------
the rails it creates it just says I

---------24:55----------
don't want to blow up and gonna shut

---------24:56----------
down everything and we were able to tell

---------24:58----------
that behavior that what we call power

---------24:59----------
cycling by using a USBC amp meter which

---------25:02----------
is really helpful when diagnosing these

---------25:04----------
these products because I saw 20 volts

---------25:07----------
okay cd32 15 s are working pp 3 b3

---------25:10----------
underscore g3 hot is there I saved

---------25:11----------
myself the time and effort of having to

---------25:13----------
make to unnecessary measurements and

---------25:14----------
unnecessary steps of troubleshooting and

---------25:16----------
then I saw 10 to 30 milliamps going back

---------25:19----------
and forth 10:30 10:30 now I know my

---------25:22----------
problem is likely a short-circuit

---------25:24----------
because it's not staying still it's

---------25:26----------
going back and forth back and forth back

---------25:27----------
and forth so it's probably a

---------25:29----------
short-circuit on one of those power

---------25:30----------
lines that we're with a chip that's not

---------25:32----------
going to allow the rail to stay on so

---------25:34----------
this really does help in terms of keep

---------25:37----------
make it really allowing you to tell what

---------25:39----------
is wrong with the product before you

---------25:41----------
actually even put your eyes on it and

---------25:43----------
that's that and as always I hope you

---------25:46----------
learned something with that you move on
