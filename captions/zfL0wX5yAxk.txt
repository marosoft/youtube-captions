---------00:00----------
okay so today I'm gonna be

---------00:01----------
troubleshooting in old MacBook that's

---------00:03----------
not charging from start to finish one of

---------00:05----------
the first things that you want to look

---------00:06----------
for here when somebody says it's not

---------00:08----------
charging is to figure out if the issue

---------00:09----------
is not charging or no battery

---------00:12----------
recognition because these are two very

---------00:14----------
different issues so if it sees the

---------00:16----------
charger and works off the charger and

---------00:18----------
sees the battery and works off the

---------00:20----------
battery but simply will not charge it

---------00:21----------
that's a very different issue than when

---------00:23----------
you simply see an X on the battery so

---------00:25----------
over here I have a machine and one of

---------00:28----------
the first things I noticed is that I

---------00:29----------
have a green light on the charger I'm

---------00:32----------
not sure if you can see the green light

---------00:33----------
in the charger here but we've got a

---------00:35----------
green light right there that we do

---------00:38----------
indeed have a green light so that means

---------00:40----------
that the one wire circuit is working now

---------00:42----------
if the one wire circuit is working in it

---------00:43----------
seeing the charger now the next step

---------00:45----------
here is to see if it sees the battery so

---------00:47----------
I'm gonna boot up into the operating

---------00:49----------
system here and I see that it says the

---------00:52----------
battery is a hundred percent and it also

---------00:54----------
has a little it sees a hundred percent

---------00:58----------
it also has a little charging icon so it

---------01:00----------
sees a battery so now let's try to

---------01:02----------
figure out why it is it may not be

---------01:03----------
charging the battery so I'm just going

---------01:05----------
to open it up here

---------01:14----------
I love having an air-conditioner this is

---------01:17----------
such crappy weather to not have an air

---------01:18----------
conditioner one of the things I used to

---------01:21----------
hate with working at other places is

---------01:23----------
like they would have a fan or something

---------01:25----------
I mean what the good is a fan going

---------01:28----------
to do when it's 95 degrees 90% humidity

---------01:30----------
thank you for blowing some 95 degree air

---------01:33----------
in my face that really makes it better

---------01:34----------
when the AC goes off I stopped working

---------01:37----------
that's really it's as simple as that if

---------01:40----------
I'm not comfortable I'm not working can

---------01:42----------
I work through discomfort sure am I

---------01:44----------
gonna work for some other [ __ ]

---------01:45----------
through discomfort no so first thing

---------01:50----------
that I'm gonna do here justice let's see

---------01:52----------
if some of the main power rails are

---------01:54----------
present when the battery is connected so

---------01:57----------
I'm going to check PP 3 V 4 2 when the

---------02:00----------
battery is connected without the charger

---------02:03----------
let's see what I get I go here it's

---------02:09----------
present PP but G 3 hot is kinda low

---------02:13----------
because the battery is not charging ok

---------02:15----------
so now I see that the battery says

---------02:19----------
replacement battery 4 and it's from a

---------02:21----------
company called they think key power

---------02:23----------
oh boy this is gonna this is no good no

---------02:25----------
good no good alright so let's see some

---------02:28----------
of the reasons that it may not be

---------02:29----------
charging so one of the first things that

---------02:31----------
I go over here is the current sensing

---------02:32----------
circuitry so let me just show you what

---------02:35----------
that is on the screen I'm going to go

---------02:36----------
over to the screen capture once I open

---------02:38----------
up the schematic for this board this is

---------02:39----------
an 8 to 0 29:36

---------02:41----------
which means it's all this dirt okay so

---------02:44----------
now we're gonna switch over to the

---------02:46----------
screen capture and let's take a look at

---------02:51----------
the current sensing section now if you

---------02:54----------
don't know what current sensing is you

---------02:55----------
should watch one of my many videos on

---------02:57----------
what current sensing circuitry does so

---------02:59----------
I'm gonna check two current sensing

---------03:00----------
circuits here the first current sensing

---------03:02----------
circuit I'm gonna check is the charger

---------03:04----------
current sensing which is over here so

---------03:06----------
the charger power before going through

---------03:08----------
to the rest of the computer goes through

---------03:10----------
this resistor there is a very small

---------03:12----------
voltage drop across the resistor very

---------03:13----------
tiny and the u 7000 is going to measure

---------03:16----------
that voltage drop at the top and the

---------03:18----------
bottom so it's gonna see what fault that

---------03:19----------
is at the top and what voltage is at the

---------03:21----------
bottom and once it does that calculation

---------03:24----------
is going to have an idea of how much

---------03:26----------
current this system is using

---------03:27----------
same thing is true for the battery we

---------03:29----------
have a battery current sensing resistor

---------03:31----------
here this is where the battery is going

---------03:34----------
to come in to the computer but before it

---------03:36----------
comes into the computer it is going to

---------03:39----------
go through this current sensing resistor

---------03:40----------
and the u 7000 chip is going to tell how

---------03:44----------
much voltage is on each end of the

---------03:47----------
current sensing resistor and once it

---------03:49----------
knows what voltage is here and what

---------03:50----------
voltage is there it's gonna have an idea

---------03:52----------
of how much voltage the system is using

---------03:54----------
now before the u 7000 gets the C 2 volt

---------03:58----------
on each side here it has to go through

---------04:00----------
one of these resistors so sometimes

---------04:02----------
these resistors are blown so let's think

---------04:04----------
here what's a quick way that I could

---------04:05----------
test every single component and also

---------04:07----------
every single line in this circuit

---------04:09----------
without having to do multiple

---------04:10----------
measurements I want to know if the line

---------04:12----------
between this current sensing line and

---------04:15----------
this resistor is good if this resistor

---------04:17----------
is good if the line between here and

---------04:19----------
this resistor is good if this resistor

---------04:21----------
is good if this line from here to here

---------04:22----------
is good if this resistor is good all

---------04:24----------
instead of measuring all that I'm gonna

---------04:26----------
measure the resistance between pins 27

---------04:29----------
and 28 and then over here I'm also going

---------04:31----------
to measure the resistance between pin 17

---------04:33----------
and 18 what I should get when I measure

---------04:35----------
the resistance between pinch 27 and 28

---------04:37----------
what I should get is the combined sum of

---------04:40----------
all the resistors in the circuit so for

---------04:43----------
the charger current sensing circuit I

---------04:44----------
should see 10 plus 0.02 plus 10 and for

---------04:48----------
the battery current sensing circuit I

---------04:50----------
should see 0 plus 0.01 plus 2.2 if I get

---------04:54----------
something much higher I know something

---------04:56----------
is wrong with that being said let me get

---------04:58----------
the microscope camera on so I can show

---------05:00----------
you what this area of the board looks

---------05:01----------
like so that I could start making

---------05:03----------
measurements and you can watch and see

---------05:05----------
how it goes now let's just switch over

---------05:09----------
and open broadcaster 2 if in view here

---------05:13----------
we go let's switch on the light for the

---------05:16----------
microscope camera so that you can see

---------05:17----------
things and I'm gonna um promote any

---------05:20----------
resistance measurements we make on a

---------05:21----------
motherboard you're going to want to

---------05:23----------
unplug any power going through the board

---------05:25----------
because power going through the board in

---------05:27----------
these cases is very very bad so we have

---------05:29----------
the multimeter over here in resistance

---------05:31----------
mode and with my phase right by the

---------05:33----------
multimeter and then move my face away so

---------05:34----------
that hopefully it stays focused on the

---------05:36----------
multimeter crap it's on my face hello I

---------05:39----------
have face detect

---------05:41----------
on my camcorder and it's really screwing

---------05:44----------
up my filmography here let's see what if

---------05:47----------
I move and if I give up oh oh I'll

---------05:51----------
figure out how to turn that stuff off

---------05:52----------
via remote or something later maybe I'll

---------05:55----------
make a foot switch for it I'll be and

---------05:58----------
that'll be a project so we do this and

---------06:03----------
let's see what am I getting look at that

---------06:07----------
beautiful leaded lead-free solder oh wow

---------06:11----------
it's really it really takes nothing to

---------06:12----------
scrape away that so we measure or

---------06:15----------
from here and here fire or is it 56 kilo

---------06:24----------
ohms whatever it is it's more it's more

---------06:27----------
than the two is more than a 2.3 ohms I

---------06:31----------
was expecting now let's measure the

---------06:32----------
charging current sensing circuit so

---------06:34----------
we're gonna measure the resistance

---------06:35----------
between here and here and that's the

---------06:43----------
twenty point would okay it's not exactly

---------06:44----------
what I was expecting but it's it's it's

---------06:46----------
fine twenty point zero three twenty

---------06:49----------
point zero nine same same for the

---------06:51----------
most part here that's that's negligible

---------06:52----------
but here's where the real problem lies

---------06:54----------
and now this is where I have to figure

---------06:56----------
out what which part of it is blown so

---------06:59----------
let's start with this resistor over here

---------07:00----------
so as you can see this is our current

---------07:02----------
sensing circuit we're going from here to

---------07:04----------
here there's this resistor on one line

---------07:06----------
that resistor is exactly what it's

---------07:11----------
supposed to be of course of course do

---------07:13----------
you know why that resistor is fine

---------07:14----------
because it's gonna be the other one

---------07:15----------
that's under this epoxy under fill'

---------07:17----------
looking it's always the stuff

---------07:19----------
that's under the epoxy under fill'

---------07:21----------
looking why would it be

---------07:22----------
something that's simple girl so let's

---------07:26----------
remove that epoxy ish underfill lookin

---------07:28----------
crap and then check the other resistor

---------07:43----------
okay I'm gonna heat it let's heat this

---------07:47----------
from far away

---------08:03----------
and eventually this epoxy should come

---------08:05----------
right off in one piece in the fantasy

---------08:10----------
world that's in my mind yep definitely

---------08:17----------
in the fantasy world that's in my mind

---------08:19----------
cuz that's not what's gonna happen on

---------08:20----------
this point it's Gemma

---------08:29----------
you

---------08:39----------
okay you now we measure the

---------08:42----------
resistor is it you

---------08:55----------
wait a second if it's not you

---------09:00----------
and it's not you

---------09:09----------
then why did I get that ridiculously

---------09:11----------
high measurement

---------09:21----------
what

---------09:24----------
you are not measuring that just a

---------09:26----------
 minute ago I piece of

---------09:30----------
 seriously that was fifty two kilos

---------09:33----------
one minute ago oh you

---------09:47----------
okay now we're going to move over to

---------09:51----------
theory number two that knockoff

---------09:56----------
eBay battery doesn't charge because it's

---------09:58----------
a knockoff eBay battery let's

---------10:05----------
try an original battery

---------10:19----------
hey giant original original okay this

---------10:31----------
battery is charging it

---------10:36----------
open this thing up we're going to turn

---------10:39----------
it on it turns on from this battery

---------10:43----------
beautiful and let's see what we get now

---------10:50----------
I'm going to plug my charger in which

---------10:52----------
was stuck on green before

---------11:03----------
and the charger light turns orange I

---------11:07----------
don't know if you can see that from here

---------11:09----------
but it turns orange now here's the part

---------11:11----------
where I'm going to lose my because

---------11:13----------
I have a really strong feeling that what

---------11:15----------
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna reconnect the

---------11:17----------
original battery that was not working

---------11:19----------
and that it's gonna give me an orange

---------11:20----------
light how much do you want to bet that

---------11:22----------
the computer fixed itself while

---------11:24----------
I was doing this on camera without me

---------11:25----------
actually doing anything that would be

---------11:27----------
pretty funny people don't get it like

---------11:31----------
nothing goes the way you want when

---------11:32----------
you're doing a video all right so I'm

---------11:40----------
gonna unplug by unplug the charger plug

---------11:44----------
it in it's green and now it's orange

---------11:53----------
mother what did I do some bit seriously

---------12:00----------
somebody watching like oh I know I get

---------12:01----------
trolled by a lot of engineers on this

---------12:03----------
channel and right now at fifty-six

---------12:04----------
thousand subscribers I know that I have

---------12:06----------
at least one of you people watching is

---------12:08----------
one of those engineers I likes a troll

---------12:09----------
everything I do what did I do

---------12:11----------
why does this work explain to me what

---------12:13----------
the did I do

---------12:16----------
seriously the resistor was because the

---------12:20----------
thing is you can heat a capacitor like a

---------12:21----------
like a tantalum capacitor or an

---------12:23----------
electrolytic and see it work again but

---------12:26----------
resistors I mean what did it not like

---------12:31----------
having epoxy over the speaker I see

---------12:42----------
medicine I'm not gonna argue with it do

---------12:45----------
you know how much I do where I

---------12:46----------
spend two or three or four hours on

---------12:48----------
something and nothing works do you know

---------12:50----------
many times I beat my head against the

---------12:52----------
wall when just something doesn't work

---------12:54----------
that should work we're against all logic

---------12:56----------
something decides to just break or be

---------12:59----------
destroyed for no reason and I look like

---------13:01----------
an idiot it happens all the time all the

---------13:06----------
time so yeah I should just take this as

---------13:09----------
you know oh yeah I'm not gonna get

---------13:14----------
tortured all the time I might as well

---------13:16----------
get some that are easy it's even working

---------13:20----------
off of it - it's at 5% already what the

---------13:27----------
 did I do

---------13:31----------
it didn't work before it does work now

---------13:36----------
I touched it anyway guess it's one of

---------13:38----------
those things it's like I get blamed all

---------13:40----------
the time for that I I get blamed

---------13:43----------
constantly for things that had nothing

---------13:44----------
to do with me I was just commenting

---------13:46----------
earlier today on some comments somebody

---------13:48----------
left on on a car mechanic they had and

---------13:51----------
you know I remember a few years ago back

---------13:53----------
before everybody knew that the that the

---------13:55----------
2011 MacBook Pro is a steaming pile of

---------13:58----------
 the 15-inch model with the GPU

---------14:00----------
issues I remember commenting on that I

---------14:01----------
said you know I remember one time that I

---------14:04----------
reinstalled somebody's operating system

---------14:06----------
and I put Libre Office on for them and

---------14:08----------
they said that ever since I installed

---------14:11----------
Libre Office they've been having

---------14:12----------
flickering with the screen and like I

---------14:14----------
didn't even charge them I told him to

---------14:16----------
leave a tip and they genuinely call back

---------14:18----------
like 10 times really mad like very close

---------14:20----------
to filing licensing claim you know

---------14:23----------
claims with the licensing agency in New

---------14:24----------
York City because they thought that I

---------14:26----------
caused their graphic strip to die so

---------14:28----------
like I am blamed constantly constantly

---------14:30----------
for where I didn't do anything and

---------14:32----------
something didn't work so yeah I can't

---------14:36----------
really say that I'm I'll take it I

---------14:39----------
didn't do anything I didn't do

---------14:42----------
it I did

---------14:49----------
and it worked so

---------14:57----------
hey I'm happy

---------15:03----------
I don't got to run 15 wires

---------15:14----------
the same way that I can kill a GPU by

---------15:17----------
installing an office application I can

---------15:19----------
fix a motherboard by looking at

---------15:22----------
it that's pretty cool yeah this is a

---------15:26----------
much shittier video than I thought it

---------15:27----------
would be really shitty video I mean like

---------15:30----------
did you learn anything cuz I didn't

---------15:32----------
learn anything that's it for today

---------15:34----------
thanks for watching
