---------00:00----------
okay so today we're gonna be going over

---------00:01----------
in really old piece-of-crap the a 1297

---------00:05----------
MacBook Pro from 2009 there are many

---------00:08----------
things that make this a piece of crap

---------00:09----------
the first thing that makes this piece of

---------00:11----------
crap is the fact that it's from 2009 it

---------00:13----------
has a Core 2 Duo and it not only has one

---------00:16----------
graphics chip it has two graphics chips

---------00:19----------
so what's the only thing that's worse

---------00:21----------
then a portable Apple product that has

---------00:24----------
one discrete graphics chip a portable

---------00:26----------
Apple product that has two discrete

---------00:28----------
graphics chips because if you've been

---------00:29----------
watching this channel for any period of

---------00:31----------
time

---------00:31----------
and you're aware that for almost every

---------00:33----------
single year for the past 10 years

---------00:34----------
there's been an extended warranty

---------00:36----------
program released because of a up

---------00:38----------
graphics chip on an Apple motherboard

---------00:41----------
ironically this one actually isn't that

---------00:44----------
bad the small graphics chip is a piece

---------00:46----------
of crap the small one is a piece of crap

---------00:48----------
it does have issues with failing the

---------00:50----------
main issue is actually with some muxing

---------00:52----------
firmware between this one and this one

---------00:55----------
so you'll see flickering on the screen

---------00:57----------
but they fixed that in some type of EFI

---------00:58----------
update I think a few years into it and

---------01:01----------
the end the main chip on here the main

---------01:03----------
graphics chip on this one is actually

---------01:05----------
pretty decent it's it I mean it's not

---------01:07----------
very powerful which is good because so

---------01:09----------
it you know it doesn't die like all the

---------01:11----------
other overpowered ones do so let's get

---------01:16----------
started on troubleshooting this board

---------01:17----------
this board doesn't turn on doesn't want

---------01:19----------
to turn on it has power on the battery

---------01:21----------
but doesn't turn on so I'm gonna go over

---------01:24----------
one of the main flaws with this machine

---------01:26----------
and one of the main things that keeps it

---------01:28----------
from turning on so as with all no power

---------01:30----------
issues the first thing that we have to

---------01:31----------
do here sure the first thing I have to

---------01:34----------
do before Oh hmm ah first thing I have

---------01:43----------
to do is find my tweezers I almost lost

---------01:46----------
my good set of tweezers I can't let that

---------01:48----------
happen the first thing that you have to

---------01:50----------
do is go through the list of power

---------01:52----------
Russells the first thing I do when I

---------01:53----------
have a no power issue so that I can try

---------01:55----------
to figure out which rails are missing

---------01:57----------
and then go from there so I know where

---------01:59----------
to look it again this is a big board

---------02:01----------
there's a lot of stuff on this board I

---------02:02----------
don't want to test every single

---------02:04----------
component that is a complete another

---------02:06----------
waste of time a lot of people getting

---------02:07----------
into this ask how do you measure the

---------02:09----------
individual components how do I check

---------02:11----------
every component on the board and or the

---------02:13----------
they'll ask me questions on measuring

---------02:14----------
specific things and that this is really

---------02:17----------
about narrowing down what could be wrong

---------02:20----------
where do you think the problem lies

---------02:21----------
narrowing it down to a specific section

---------02:24----------
that's more important to me than

---------02:25----------
checking every component on the board so

---------02:27----------
as long as people are asking questions

---------02:28----------
about that I feel like it's worth

---------02:30----------
discussing and it's worth bringing up

---------02:32----------
because if you are in that mentality of

---------02:34----------
let's check every component on the board

---------02:35----------
then you're in that mentality of wasting

---------02:37----------
a lot of time so first thing to do here

---------02:41----------
is bring up the schematic all right so

---------02:43----------
we're gonna go over to the page of the

---------02:44----------
schematic that has power rails so we're

---------02:46----------
gonna go over to page 6 and by page 6 I

---------02:49----------
mean page 7 and by page 7 I mean page

---------02:52----------
aid I used to have a memory that was a

---------02:55----------
long time ago so the first thing that we

---------02:57----------
check here is PP Buzz g3 hot and it says

---------02:59----------
6 volts but we know that that's

---------03:01----------
I know that that's because I've

---------03:03----------
measured this before on working machines

---------03:05----------
and it's not that that amount so if I

---------03:08----------
measure P P bus g3 hot I get eight point

---------03:16----------
three seven it's supposed to be eight

---------03:17----------
point four that is close enough and

---------03:19----------
again the Apple schematic is just

---------03:21----------
 there so now we're going to go

---------03:22----------
back to page seven and now when it comes

---------03:31----------
to Rails like this P P DC n I already

---------03:34----------
know the DC and rail is present it has

---------03:37----------
to be present because I already have

---------03:39----------
this I already have the P P bus g3 hot

---------03:43----------
rail I wouldn't have the P P bus g3 hot

---------03:46----------
rail if P P DC and was not present so

---------03:48----------
common sense tells me that's their pp 3

---------03:50----------
v4 - let's check PP 3 V 4 - next so we

---------03:54----------
opened my board view software it's open

---------03:58----------
the file for this pp 3 V 4 to underscore

---------04:04----------
g3 hot right

---------04:15----------
-

---------04:21----------
hello so I go here and now you can't see

---------04:26----------
all right I go here and what do I get I

---------04:30----------
supposed to get PP 3 V 4 2 and because

---------04:34----------
I'm measuring in the wrong place I get P

---------04:36----------
P 3 V for nothing

---------04:37----------
alright let's try to measure in the

---------04:38----------
right place that's fine though the board

---------04:43----------
view is upside down as it always is

---------04:45----------
wow that's loud oh that's loud

---------05:09----------
okay

---------05:13----------
BAM three point four is there so now we

---------05:16----------
move on to the next PP 5 vs 3 the next

---------05:27----------
one on the list is going to be PP 5 vs

---------05:29----------
three underscore reg wrong bored view

---------05:37----------
software still wrong bored view software

---------05:41----------
interesting

---------05:49----------
BP 5 vs 3 reg I should see it on this

---------05:52----------
capacitor over here alright pp 5 vs 3 is

---------05:59----------
missing so now we so now what I'm gonna

---------06:02----------
do is I'm gonna check for a short to

---------06:04----------
ground so I know I have no voltage there

---------06:08----------
now I want to see if there's a short to

---------06:09----------
ground now with my methodology what I

---------06:11----------
like to do is check the beginning in the

---------06:12----------
end of a circuit so now I've checked the

---------06:13----------
end of it and the end of it has no short

---------06:15----------
two grounds and no power so now I can

---------06:17----------
check the beginning of it the reason I

---------06:19----------
do that is because I don't want to waste

---------06:20----------
time on a lot of things that are

---------06:22----------
inconsequential ep5 vs3 so let's see

---------06:27----------
where do you come from

---------06:36----------
you

---------06:44----------
here we go this is a buck converter now

---------06:48----------
I've been over this so many times before

---------06:50----------
many many times before pp5 es 3 comes

---------06:53----------
out at the end if you don't know what a

---------06:55----------
buck converter is you should read my

---------06:57----------
earlier posts on what a buck converter

---------06:58----------
is so we're going to go over here and

---------07:01----------
see that en1

---------07:03----------
is on this side and enable that's gonna

---------07:05----------
turn it on so we go over to en 1 and we

---------07:08----------
see that it's we see that it's are you

---------07:13----------
 kidding me Apple what is this

---------07:16----------
what is this box look it's a little box

---------07:19----------
that it drew to itself look look it's

---------07:21----------
touching itself Jesus Christ what the

---------07:24----------
 is wrong with Apple every schematic

---------07:27----------
from 2008 and 2009 sucks I went over

---------07:30----------
this in my video on the 8 - 0 2530 just

---------07:32----------
a week ago what is this this is a

---------07:34----------
 box

---------07:36----------
it's like pee-wee Herman from

---------07:38----------
the early 90s wrote this schematic look

---------07:40----------
at it goes in a little loop and just

---------07:42----------
touches itself ok I'm just going to

---------07:44----------
assume that this is where it's coming

---------07:45----------
from and this is gonna confuse people

---------07:47----------
who are trying to learn these commands

---------07:48----------
you know just kind of get a general

---------07:49----------
overview on these schematics for the

---------07:51----------
first time it's gonna confuse them a lot

---------07:54----------
and because they're not you know I know

---------07:57----------
that that's probably what that signal is

---------07:59----------
gonna is for I didn't just drawing a

---------08:03----------
line in my head but it's kind of hard if

---------08:05----------
you're a newbie to really follow that

---------08:08----------
and that sucks so yeah but that's that's

---------08:10----------
Apple so that's going to come from here

---------08:11----------
p.m. sleep s4l is going to come from

---------08:17----------
from the mCP 79 so now let's check p.m.

---------08:23----------
sleep s4l

---------08:32----------
you

---------08:56----------
that's not a p.m. sleep as that 0.8 4 or

---------09:00----------
5 volts wait a second that's resistance

---------09:03----------
mode whoa whoa you idiot you dumb

---------09:06----------
don't okay am measuring resistance when

---------09:10----------
I want more voltage and B I don't even

---------09:11----------
have the thing plugged in let's

---------09:13----------
try this again

---------09:14----------
let's try this again dumb dumb all right

---------09:17----------
we get 0.01 three volts does that sound

---------09:24----------
like what it's supposed to be too you

---------09:26----------
know so next up on the list what is

---------09:30----------
going to produce that actually let's

---------09:31----------
just short the power pads for a quick

---------09:33----------
second here try it turn it on and now

---------09:36----------
measure I forgot this is a Core 2 Duo

---------09:37----------
and that is not going to show up

---------09:39----------
immediately yeah it's still not showing

---------09:42----------
up at all all right so now we go over to

---------09:48----------
let's see now at this point a lot of

---------09:51----------
people are gonna say replace MCP MCP is

---------09:54----------
bad it's not shooting out the signal

---------09:56----------
that's supposed to but this is

---------10:00----------
sure no power issue so let's go over to

---------10:03----------
page seven over here or eight because I

---------10:06----------
forgot the page number now let's go

---------10:10----------
through these rails now what here is

---------10:13----------
gonna power the mCP whoa P P 1 vo 5

---------10:22----------
underscore s 5 MC P hmm hmm so send 1.5

---------10:29----------
volts to the mCP when you're in an S 5

---------10:31----------
State which is what I may have should be

---------10:33----------
in right now

---------10:34----------
let's take a look at that let's take a

---------10:43----------
look

---------10:49----------
look at me

---------10:54----------
all right what do we have here but a

---------10:56----------
tantalum capacitor to ground on output

---------10:59----------
now one of the things you should know

---------11:00----------
here is that electrolytic capacitors

---------11:02----------
have the potential to leak and tantalum

---------11:05----------
capacitors often have the potential to

---------11:06----------
short you should always know how these

---------11:07----------
components are likely to fail so for

---------11:09----------
example resistors don't fail by becoming

---------11:11----------
a lower resistance most of the time they

---------11:13----------
fail by becoming a much higher

---------11:14----------
resistance or by blowing or just not

---------11:16----------
conducting properly at all the way

---------11:19----------
tantalum capacitors usually fail is they

---------11:21----------
start to slowly short-circuit so they

---------11:23----------
don't fail as in they're just not a

---------11:24----------
capacitor anymore they fail as and they

---------11:26----------
slowly start to leak the evopower to

---------11:30----------
ground so if I'm gonna measure on C

---------11:32----------
77071 what do I get

---------11:35----------
but that's not 1.05 not replacing the

---------11:46----------
mCP the reason I bring this up is

---------11:48----------
because a lot of people at this point

---------11:50----------
will try to replace the mCP even worse

---------11:52----------
they'll start burning the mCP and you

---------11:54----------
know what's bad about this what's bad

---------11:56----------
about it is that when they do that it'll

---------11:58----------
work again so they'll say that they

---------12:00----------
fixed it and the reason it winds up

---------12:02----------
working again is because you heat that

---------12:03----------
little tantalum capacitor up a little

---------12:05----------
bit and then it stops shorting so let's

---------12:07----------
see if I can get this one to do it I

---------12:09----------
probably won't because this machine is

---------12:11----------
seven years old so it's probably and

---------12:13----------
that the owner said that every now and

---------12:15----------
then it would turn on and turn off and

---------12:17----------
turn on and turn off so that capacitor

---------12:19----------
is probably you know it's far past its

---------12:21----------
prime but I'm gonna try doing here I'm

---------12:22----------
just gonna heat it up a little bit for

---------12:24----------
you and let's see if I can get it to

---------12:26----------
work again temporarily just by heating

---------12:27----------
it just thing just to really drive home

---------12:29----------
that points

---------12:48----------
all right so let's see what I get I

---------12:50----------
heated the capacitor up plug this in and

---------13:00----------
check that out one point zero nine seven

---------13:02----------
volts one point zero nine seven volts

---------13:05----------
this is again this is this is why this

---------13:08----------
whole oven thing gets big you know gets

---------13:10----------
me enraged and blah it's because so many

---------13:14----------
of these components can work again

---------13:16----------
temporarily even when they're clearly

---------13:17----------
destroyed if you just heat it

---------13:21----------
heating is an excellent diagnostic tool

---------13:24----------
right when you use it with precision so

---------13:26----------
for example I want to see is it that

---------13:27----------
capacitor I can heat it and if I get a

---------13:30----------
response out of it

---------13:31----------
then I know that that component is bad

---------13:32----------
and faulty but heating an entire board

---------13:35----------
it's you're not fixing anything but it's

---------13:38----------
also really not a diagnostic tool the

---------13:40----------
reason it's not a diagnostic tool is

---------13:41----------
because there's no precision how do you

---------13:43----------
know what part of the board was actually

---------13:45----------
bad you have no way of knowing what part

---------13:47----------
of the board is bad because you heated

---------13:49----------
the entire board so you essentially

---------13:52----------
heating is one of the best ways to you

---------13:54----------
know just kind of help diagnose specific

---------13:57----------
faults in specific areas it's a really

---------13:58----------
good tool in your arsenal but it's only

---------14:01----------
good if you use it the right way

---------14:02----------
Herod using it is to heat a specific

---------14:07----------
area I'm not saying that you should but

---------14:09----------
you can heat a specific area and you can

---------14:11----------
heat a capacitor and because it's heated

---------14:13----------
will work but do you know it's gonna

---------14:15----------
happen 20 minutes later once that

---------14:17----------
capacitor cools down it's going to go

---------14:19----------
back to its original state and it's

---------14:21----------
going a short circuit and the reason

---------14:24----------
that I get all you know all about this

---------14:29----------
whole reheating stuff is because there

---------14:30----------
are so many people that do this

---------14:31----------
knowingly like there are people that

---------14:33----------
genuinely don't know any better they

---------14:35----------
don't know any better they think that

---------14:36----------
they actually fix something so they're

---------14:37----------
like okay great I fix something but then

---------14:40----------
you also have the scam artists that know

---------14:42----------
they didn't fix anything that offer a

---------14:44----------
30-day warranty they offered it

---------14:47----------
and then when the customer comes back on

---------14:48----------
day 31 they say huh oh man we told you

---------14:51----------
only had a 30-day warranty on this we

---------14:53----------
can't help you out but you know we can

---------14:54----------
fix it again we'll just give you 10% off

---------14:55----------
this time because you're returning

---------14:57----------
customer and that's a scam

---------15:00----------
that is a that's a scam

---------15:02----------
and professional places have been doing

---------15:05----------
this for years which is why I'm against

---------15:09----------
that whole you know reflow oven Blair I

---------15:12----------
don't really care people honestly if

---------15:15----------
somebody does it in their own home I

---------15:16----------
know I've said in other videos like you

---------15:17----------
shouldn't that was on me so

---------15:19----------
that was that was me saying something

---------15:21----------
that was because I was enraged

---------15:23----------
but honestly if somebody wants to heat

---------15:25----------
some up in their house that it

---------15:26----------
lasts again for a week before they you

---------15:28----------
know they get their new one or whatever

---------15:29----------
I get that but the reason that this myth

---------15:32----------
is legitimately damaging the reason this

---------15:34----------
myth is up is because you have

---------15:37----------
professional individuals that buy into

---------15:40----------
the myth and once they buy into the myth

---------15:42----------
they start using this myth and

---------15:44----------
screwing people and some of them screw

---------15:49----------
people you know on purpose because they

---------15:51----------
just think it's cool they just think

---------15:53----------
it's cool that they get to collect money

---------15:54----------
without having actually do many work and

---------15:56----------
some people you know some genuinely

---------15:59----------
screw people without even knowing that

---------16:01----------
what they're doing is wrong but either

---------16:03----------
way it's it's to say it doesn't matter

---------16:05----------
you just you can't screw people so what

---------16:07----------
I do is instead of using a tantalum

---------16:09----------
capacitor here I'm gonna use a film

---------16:11----------
capacitor here it's going to perform

---------16:12----------
this say it's the same function except

---------16:15----------
it's not going to have that that issue

---------16:16----------
of over time becoming short-circuited

---------16:20----------
and shorting my MCP voltage to ground

---------16:23----------
and leaking my MCP voltage to ground

---------16:25----------
cumin mind on a buck converter on the

---------16:26----------
output of it that capacitor is there to

---------16:28----------
smooth out the output but it's also

---------16:29----------
there it's also there to Jack like a

---------16:33----------
battery to store the voltage and if it's

---------16:35----------
not storing the voltage then you run

---------16:37----------
into problems so what I'm going to do

---------16:41----------
here is I'm gonna make I made space to

---------16:43----------
fit a larger capacitor in there so think

---------16:45----------
of this like remodeling think of this

---------16:48----------
like re you know it's not remodeling

---------16:50----------
your living room right so I move the

---------16:53----------
coil up after I move the coil up that's

---------16:57----------
going to give me some space to put in a

---------16:59----------
larger capacity down here and then I'm

---------17:01----------
gonna put this wire down here I if I

---------17:06----------
feel bad I touch the end of this coil as

---------17:08----------
much as it's bad that I touch the casing

---------17:09----------
of the coil there's a coil inside there

---------17:11----------
and this is pretty much the armor on the

---------17:13----------
out

---------17:13----------
side so as bad as that is I didn't it's

---------17:16----------
not it's not the biggest deal because I

---------17:21----------
didn't actually touch the component but

---------17:23----------
I'm gonna do is I move the coil up so

---------17:26----------
that I have room to put a larger size

---------17:27----------
capacitor here that's actually gonna you

---------17:29----------
know work long term and then I'm gonna

---------17:31----------
put a wire here and use that wire is

---------17:33----------
kind of my trait as because I don't like

---------17:36----------
scraping the board you can scrape the

---------17:38----------
board there were models where you can

---------17:39----------
this one there are too many things going

---------17:41----------
on in that area so I prefer not to so

---------17:43----------
I'm just gonna try it this is kind of an

---------17:45----------
awkward place to put my iron so it's

---------17:47----------
kind of hard to arrange this so I am

---------17:49----------
just going to yeah lay down a wire and

---------17:56----------
then I'm gonna solder a capacitor in

---------17:58----------
there s s o DD ER for all those people

---------18:01----------
who were curious

---------18:10----------
it's the height of professionalism here

---------18:16----------
okay I'm gonna grab myself a film cat

---------18:40----------
I had a spool of 50 of these I can't

---------18:42----------
believe I actually ran out this defect

---------18:48----------
is that common

---------18:54----------
okay and now we're going to put it on

---------18:57----------
here

---------19:05----------
see what I'm doing here

---------19:25----------
got to get my heat in my air up a little

---------19:27----------
bit this is not the JBC

---------19:40----------
okay now I can see that when I once I

---------19:42----------
see the side of shooting out from the

---------19:43----------
bottom I know that I've made good some

---------19:45----------
good contact there yes I know this is

---------19:50----------
not the quote/unquote proper size

---------19:53----------
capacitor for this board but you know

---------19:56----------
what it's not gonna die

---------19:58----------
not that that's really all that matters

---------19:59----------
what would you rather I do would you

---------20:02----------
rather I put the capacitor that fits the

---------20:03----------
board would you rather I put the

---------20:05----------
capacitor that's actually going to work

---------20:06----------
and not come back for warranty the whole

---------20:09----------
thing here remember if the consumer

---------20:10----------
comes back for warranty they're going to

---------20:13----------
have although they're going to thing

---------20:14----------
ultimately have less confidence and us

---------20:16----------
fixing this stuff so I I really don't

---------20:20----------
think they're gonna open up the Machine

---------20:21----------
and look in the bottom of it and see

---------20:23----------
that I fit this there and go I don't

---------20:24----------
like my macbook anymore because this guy

---------20:26----------
put a different size capacitor

---------20:27----------
there but this is the long-term fix this

---------20:30----------
is the long-term solution get rid of the

---------20:32----------
tantalum one over there cuz keep in mind

---------20:35----------
that capacitor not only is it's not the

---------20:37----------
load is not being shared amongst others

---------20:39----------
it's the only large capacitor on that

---------20:41----------
buck converter on output not only is

---------20:43----------
that the case but it's also the case

---------20:45----------
over here that this rail is always on s5

---------20:50----------
even if the battery is dead even if the

---------20:52----------
battery is dropped to a voltage that is

---------20:53----------
insufficient for the computer to turn on

---------20:55----------
that voltage is still sufficient for

---------20:58----------
every other voltage in the machine and

---------20:59----------
be present including this one so even if

---------21:02----------
your battery is dead this is on if it's

---------21:04----------
plugged in it's on if it's not plugged

---------21:05----------
in and the battery is there and it as

---------21:07----------
charged it's on this rail is always on

---------21:09----------
for the life of your machine and there's

---------21:11----------
only one capacitor on output and it's a

---------21:13----------
 tantalum so again this this is

---------21:16----------
one of those big things with the oven

---------21:18----------
thing and for all you people out there

---------21:19----------
who think I'm being paranoid you think

---------21:21----------
this isn't a scam that they'll have been

---------21:22----------
doing for a long time

---------21:23----------
I mean look up with the warranty repair

---------21:25----------
centers do so you know when you buy

---------21:26----------
those extended warranties when you buy

---------21:28----------
extended warranties at Staples or Best

---------21:30----------
Buy or any of those places the idea

---------21:33----------
there is the thing is they already have

---------21:34----------
your money they're not refunding you so

---------21:37----------
what they when they sent what they do is

---------21:39----------
they send this stuff out to a service

---------21:41----------
center and all they care about is that

---------21:42----------
they can get it to work they don't care

---------21:44----------
about customer satisfaction they don't

---------21:46----------
care about any of that because they

---------21:47----------
don't again they they already got your

---------21:48----------
money nine months or two years ago they

---------21:51----------
don't have to care about satisfying you

---------21:52----------
all they need to do is live up to

---------21:54----------
into the agreement which is just make

---------21:55----------
this thing work again and if it doesn't

---------21:57----------
work a month later just send it back and

---------21:59----------
we'll make it won't do a weekend and

---------22:01----------
what they do oftentimes to keep the

---------22:03----------
labour cost as low as humanly possible

---------22:04----------
is they will just put the in an

---------22:08----------
oven because again what do you think

---------22:09----------
costs more money somebody who knows how

---------22:11----------
to find this or somebody with a $90

---------22:13----------
Hamilton Beach toaster oven

---------22:15----------
that being said what's up oh yeah sure

---------22:22----------
let's do this we turn it on BAM yep you

---------22:31----------
piece of

---------22:32----------
did you just beep at me it's beeping at

---------22:35----------
me all right no no no you don't get to

---------22:40----------
ruin my video let's see let's try the

---------22:42----------
top Ram slot here old stuff sucks beep

---------23:03----------
hello you don't you ruin my video you

---------23:08----------
 old piece of all

---------23:18----------
right I'm try the different stick in a

---------23:19----------
different slot

---------23:42----------
now we get to figure out if it's the RAM

---------23:44----------
stick of the RAM slot see you hear that

---------23:47----------
shine and they unplug it and take this

---------23:50----------
Ram stick and we're gonna try it again

---------23:51----------
in the other slot it's very common for

---------23:56----------
one of the slots to go bad one of these

---------23:57----------
Ram slots is usually surface mount

---------23:59----------
I mean BGA and the other Ram slot is

---------24:01----------
through-hole the one that's BGA always

---------24:03----------
dies okay so it's the stick whew ah no

---------24:07----------
that MCP anyway as you can see fixed BAM

---------24:12----------
and again what do you the reason that

---------24:15----------
you see this in so many warranty service

---------24:16----------
facilities is that it is cheaper to hire

---------24:18----------
somebody at minimum wage at six dollars

---------24:21----------
an hour and have them put the boards

---------24:22----------
into a 30 or 90 dollar oven than it is

---------24:24----------
to pay somebody twenty to thirty five

---------24:26----------
dollars an hour to figure out what's

---------24:28----------
wrong with it and use advanced tools to

---------24:30----------
come to the conclusion as to what's

---------24:31----------
wrong and the warranty service facility

---------24:33----------
they don't care they got your money

---------24:37----------
already they have your money all they

---------24:39----------
have to do is do the bare minimum

---------24:40----------
required to not get sued and that is

---------24:43----------
often taking the board and shoving it

---------24:45----------
into an oven which is what most of these

---------24:47----------
places do it's a scam

---------24:49----------
it's it makes repair look bad

---------24:52----------
and this is why I talk about it all the

---------24:54----------
time because it makes our profession

---------24:57----------
look bad it screws over customers and

---------24:59----------
it's something that should just come to

---------25:00----------
an end that's that for today and as

---------25:03----------
always I hope you learned something
