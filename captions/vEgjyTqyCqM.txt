---------00:05----------
all right so today what I'd like to talk

---------00:07----------
about is an experience that I had this

---------00:11----------
weekend with with potential new clients

---------00:15----------
and I do and I thought this as with most

---------00:17----------
things I try to I try to take the things

---------00:19----------
that happen in my life and I try to take

---------00:21----------
the things to happen in my business to

---------00:22----------
try to relate them to a greater overall

---------00:24----------
concept and this is one that I learned

---------00:28----------
when I was about 17 18 years old so what

---------00:32----------
happened is that somebody showed up for

---------00:34----------
my one of my tutoring sessions and they

---------00:37----------
went to you know pay online they went to

---------00:39----------
like add themselves as a client or

---------00:41----------
whatever and then they they had a called

---------00:42----------
and said okay I need to I need you to

---------00:45----------
add me for this day and I was very very

---------00:46----------
politely and kindly said I can't do that

---------00:49----------
but once you go through the online

---------00:51----------
scheduler you'll be able to add yourself

---------00:54----------
and as you can see if you check my

---------00:56----------
website right now you'll see that it's

---------00:57----------
one of the very obvious basic bare-bones

---------01:00----------
rules that I have then and I said I try

---------01:03----------
to make it sound pretty you know like

---------01:04----------
it's an important part of the process

---------01:06----------
that you need to sign up and use my

---------01:08----------
scheduler it's that simple it's just a

---------01:11----------
very very basic thing it makes my life

---------01:13----------
easy it then syncs the scheduler to the

---------01:16----------
phone I can see that somebody booked I

---------01:17----------
can see uh you know I can see the dates

---------01:20----------
I don't have to worry about like adding

---------01:22----------
things and typing your phone number and

---------01:24----------
name and all that crap in manual it's

---------01:25----------
just a very basic little system and my

---------01:28----------
ideas is very otherwise very simple here

---------01:32----------
is that if you're coming to learn how

---------01:35----------
you know the difference between VCC IO

---------01:37----------
and V Corps ypp 3 V 4 2 has to be

---------01:40----------
present before P P budget III hottes

---------01:42----------
president if you're coming to learn all

---------01:43----------
that stuff um you'd better know how to

---------01:47----------
use an online scheduler whether it's a

---------01:49----------
lack of knowledge or lack of willpower

---------01:51----------
to use the online scheduler I don't care

---------01:54----------
if you can't learn how to use that

---------01:57----------
because you don't feel like it or

---------01:58----------
whatever then how are you going to feel

---------02:01----------
like learning at Assad or qfn on

---------02:02----------
properly how are you going to feel like

---------02:05----------
you know troubleshooting with the board

---------02:07----------
not plugged in when you're doing

---------02:09----------
resistance and diode mode

---------02:11----------
ah it's kind of hard for me to adjust my

---------02:13----------
like pretty sure I'm 99% certain I tore

---------02:17----------
my quad over the past six months and I

---------02:19----------
just kind of been making it worse and

---------02:21----------
worse with all this running I've been

---------02:22----------
doing but anyway oh uh if you can't do

---------02:26----------
that then how are you going to get the

---------02:27----------
rest right and a lot of people think

---------02:29----------
that this is a petty concept that I'm on

---------02:31----------
they think it's petty they think it's

---------02:33----------
immature they think I'm being mean they

---------02:36----------
think that oh this person's paying a lot

---------02:38----------
of money so since they're paying a lot

---------02:40----------
of money you should do this that and the

---------02:42----------
other and the gentleman showed up after

---------02:43----------
I told them specifically that you need

---------02:45----------
to book this online because I want to

---------02:47----------
start and it's like a there's been no

---------02:49----------
notice here B you didn't use the [ __ ]

---------02:53----------
schedule and he showed up on Sunday with

---------02:55----------
a check in hand for two thousand three

---------02:58----------
hundred ninety five dollars a certified

---------03:01----------
check not one of those [ __ ] checks

---------03:03----------
like I talked about in the other video

---------03:04----------
not one of those things were like you

---------03:06----------
[ __ ] write your name on it and you're

---------03:07----------
saying I have money trust me call these

---------03:10----------
guys and they'll tell you not that

---------03:11----------
[ __ ]

---------03:11----------
but the type that's actually good like

---------03:13----------
certified check from Chase Bank I know

---------03:16----------
what they look like

---------03:17----------
I've had them written up before and I

---------03:20----------
told him a leaf very very simply it's at

---------03:23----------
least he's like oh but no I want to go

---------03:25----------
you know we had a phone conversation

---------03:27----------
about this I have instructions on the

---------03:29----------
website it says very clearly on the

---------03:32----------
website to sign up through the scheduler

---------03:34----------
I told you over the phone as politely as

---------03:36----------
I could and kindly that I need you to

---------03:39----------
sign up via the scheduler you decided to

---------03:42----------
ignore all of that [ __ ] and bum-rush my

---------03:44----------
business and wanted me to literally

---------03:46----------
start right there like it doesn't matter

---------03:49----------
that there's nobody else in the store it

---------03:51----------
doesn't matter that I have other things

---------03:52----------
that I'm working on it doesn't matter

---------03:54----------
that I plan on going home in half an

---------03:56----------
hour

---------03:57----------
and he's overwrought tomorrow and it's

---------03:59----------
like you know I have things I plan on

---------04:02----------
doing tomorrow like use the scheduler

---------04:05----------
one of the things I like about the

---------04:06----------
scheduler is it doesn't let you book

---------04:08----------
without advance notice you need to give

---------04:10----------
like a few days of notice before and it

---------04:12----------
also shows you what days are available

---------04:14----------
and not available I don't want to deal

---------04:16----------
with double booking I don't want to deal

---------04:17----------
with crap which is why I love having a

---------04:19----------
schedule and again the thing that the

---------04:21----------
thing that I I that I'm stressing to

---------04:23----------
people it's not it a lot of it

---------04:24----------
to do with the respect portion of it

---------04:26----------
right like if you don't respect my rules

---------04:28----------
how can I expect that you're going to

---------04:30----------
respect to the boards that I give you to

---------04:32----------
work on often that belong to my

---------04:34----------
customers that you're going to respect

---------04:36----------
my equipment which cost thousands of

---------04:37----------
dollars that's a secondary concern my

---------04:41----------
primary concern again is if you're if

---------04:43----------
you don't feel like using a scheduler

---------04:46----------
like that is the easiest part of this

---------04:48----------
process the online scheduler is the part

---------04:51----------
of this process that requires no brain

---------04:54----------
power

---------04:54----------
nothing no effort it's like all you have

---------04:57----------
to do is spend 30 seconds reading it

---------04:59----------
clicking and it just becomes obvious how

---------05:01----------
this thing works if somebody's not

---------05:03----------
willing to do that how can I trust that

---------05:06----------
you're willing to put 96 of the balls

---------05:08----------
back on and make sure that they're all

---------05:10----------
an even size on an SMC how can I trust

---------05:13----------
that you're going to to wanna to

---------05:16----------
actually measure every single one of the

---------05:18----------
pins of a 28 pen I see that you're going

---------05:20----------
to measure every single one of their

---------05:22----------
diode mode measurements to ground and

---------05:24----------
compare it to a proper one and not just

---------05:26----------
give up by pin 25 because quote most of

---------05:29----------
them were good it's one of those things

---------05:32----------
where it's like how you do one thing is

---------05:34----------
really kind of showing me how you're

---------05:35----------
going to do the rest so and again and um

---------05:39----------
one of the things that I've also tried

---------05:41----------
to avoid here is taking someone's money

---------05:43----------
when I truly genuinely believe that they

---------05:46----------
will not be able to learn so I tell

---------05:48----------
people to laying it check out my basic

---------05:50----------
electronics playlist before you come

---------05:51----------
here check out all of this stuff I

---------05:53----------
talked with people before they sign up

---------05:55----------
for this if they have zero experience

---------05:58----------
like zero experience doing any of this

---------06:00----------
stuff I legitimately just tell them

---------06:02----------
don't don't sign up because I want

---------06:05----------
people to come here that have a genuine

---------06:07----------
chance of learning and if somebody does

---------06:11----------
anything before the fact to show me that

---------06:13----------
they're probably not going to have a

---------06:14----------
chance of learning I would like to save

---------06:16----------
myself the hassle and save them the

---------06:19----------
money and just have them not show up

---------06:22----------
again I gave that guy back is 22,000

---------06:24----------
$395 check for a five day session and

---------06:26----------
again this is something that a lot of

---------06:28----------
people say is Patty is unprofessional

---------06:30----------
because I am because you know you should

---------06:33----------
just deal with those things and it's one

---------06:34----------
of those things that you look at that I

---------06:36----------
learned

---------06:36----------
when I started working at this recording

---------06:37----------
studio the smaller one and people were

---------06:40----------
saying oh well they're not obeying our

---------06:42----------
rules here they're doing this and they

---------06:43----------
shouldn't be but they're paying us a lot

---------06:46----------
of money so and and I remember there's

---------06:49----------
one drummer there this one drummer he

---------06:51----------
was such a person to look up to such a

---------06:53----------
person to learn from he was such a great

---------06:55----------
influence in my own life his name was

---------06:57----------
Michael Carvin and I remember him just

---------06:58----------
looking at me one time and he never the

---------07:00----------
thing about Michael Carvin is he had a

---------07:02----------
very stern and strict demeanor and he

---------07:04----------
had a very very strong set of ethics and

---------07:06----------
beliefs by which he lived his life but

---------07:09----------
he never talked down to me he would talk

---------07:12----------
down to a concept he would talk down to

---------07:14----------
a stupid or silly way of doing something

---------07:16----------
but he always talked to me as if I was

---------07:18----------
an equal even though he was 17 had no

---------07:21----------
experience with some snot-nosed teenager

---------07:22----------
and he was a greatly experienced greatly

---------07:25----------
accomplished adult and one of the things

---------07:27----------
I remember like it was a session that

---------07:31----------
showed up late and they were kind of

---------07:33----------
[ __ ] around with the equipment and

---------07:34----------
it's like oh yeah but they're paying so

---------07:36----------
I'm being nice of them because they're

---------07:38----------
paying me hourly at least they're paying

---------07:39----------
right and he looks at me and he's like

---------07:41----------
and he's like laughing he's like and I

---------07:44----------
didn't understand why he was laughing

---------07:45----------
and I'm paraphrasing because it's been

---------07:47----------
10 years literally ten years since we

---------07:48----------
had this conversation but I remember him

---------07:50----------
saying something along the lines of all

---------07:52----------
right so you can't trust them to show up

---------07:55----------
on time yep music you can't trust them

---------07:58----------
to respect your equipment I'm like yeah

---------08:00----------
how can you trust that they're going to

---------08:03----------
pay you at the end of your session and

---------08:05----------
I'm like well because they haven't

---------08:07----------
showed me any reason that they're not

---------08:08----------
going to they didn't say they weren't

---------08:09----------
going to they look like they're going

---------08:10----------
she was like do they respect your rules

---------08:13----------
do they respect your time do they

---------08:15----------
respect your equipment how can you

---------08:16----------
expect that somebody who does not

---------08:17----------
respect you in one way will then

---------08:19----------
magically respect you in another way how

---------08:21----------
can you expect somebody who does not

---------08:23----------
respect your time it does not respect

---------08:25----------
your equipment that does not respect

---------08:26----------
your instruments to then respect your

---------08:29----------
you know your requirement that they pay

---------08:32----------
their bill at the end you set the tone

---------08:34----------
for the relationship see he told me if

---------08:36----------
this client does not pay you at the end

---------08:38----------
of the session it is nothing to do with

---------08:40----------
them it's not their fault because I set

---------08:42----------
the stage for how I was willing to be

---------08:44----------
treated from the beginning of the

---------08:45----------
transaction and since I set the stage to

---------08:47----------
be treated like a

---------08:49----------
of crap from the beginning of the

---------08:50----------
transaction that's how they were going

---------08:52----------
to treat me it's just it's are these

---------08:55----------
things that just like that that other

---------08:56----------
people don't think about they think we

---------08:58----------
have to be nice because they're paying a

---------08:59----------
lot of money we have to act professional

---------09:02----------
which is just shut up and take it and

---------09:04----------
nod and say yes and say yes sir I'm

---------09:06----------
sorry sir I'll do that sir don't worry

---------09:08----------
about it sir rather than say the things

---------09:10----------
that need to be said like this session

---------09:13----------
was supposed to start at 12:00 12:45

---------09:16----------
[ __ ] or hey you don't know how to play

---------09:20----------
that instrument can you please not play

---------09:21----------
that instrument that was another thing

---------09:22----------
that used to get Michael Carvin I

---------09:24----------
remember him saying there was a there

---------09:26----------
was this one guy in the group that was

---------09:28----------
that did not know how to play drums

---------09:30----------
Michael carbon is an amazing drummer

---------09:31----------
he's not just a drummer that just go pop

---------09:33----------
he's you know you know you know those

---------09:34----------
drummers that kind of say like oh I play

---------09:36----------
the drums because I can you know hit the

---------09:38----------
bass drum and the snare drum with with

---------09:40----------
like you know and stay on tempo on point

---------09:42----------
that's not playing the drums he saw

---------09:44----------
playing the drums as a legitimate art

---------09:46----------
form as a way of self-expression as a

---------09:48----------
way it was just so much more than just

---------09:50----------
you know what you hear and a lot and a

---------09:52----------
lot of cookie cutter stuff and this guy

---------09:56----------
just goats in the drums he has no idea

---------09:57----------
what he's doing absolutely no clue he's

---------09:59----------
just hitting stuff he's hitting stuff

---------10:00----------
and he's like man this is one of those

---------10:01----------
things that gets to me you don't see you

---------10:03----------
see people go up to a viola and just

---------10:05----------
start going blue when they don't know

---------10:07----------
how to play it do you see people go up

---------10:08----------
to a flute and just blow in it when they

---------10:10----------
don't know how to play it like it's a

---------10:11----------
whistle no but you got all these people

---------10:13----------
that walk up to the drums and start

---------10:14----------
beating them like there's not like

---------10:16----------
there's a no respect for the craft like

---------10:18----------
there's no like like you can just do

---------10:20----------
that without having any clue how to play

---------10:23----------
it you don't do that with every other

---------10:24----------
instrument so why do you do it with this

---------10:26----------
one he was a person who had an amazing

---------10:29----------
level of respect for his craft and he

---------10:31----------
expected that level of respect from

---------10:33----------
other people he had this system again

---------10:35----------
they were about I still remember Michael

---------10:36----------
Carvin had a school of drumming and then

---------10:38----------
you had about 10 or 11 other rooms in

---------10:41----------
that same hallway in that same suite in

---------10:43----------
the film Center building that also had

---------10:45----------
schools of drumming and his was set up

---------10:49----------
like a machine like he had a session at

---------10:52----------
12 o'clock they show up at 11:50 they

---------10:55----------
knock on his door he acknowledges them

---------10:57----------
he sit back down at 12 o'clock he Lee

---------11:00----------
opens the door they come

---------11:02----------
and they have their session and then

---------11:04----------
they leave you it wasn't any of this

---------11:06----------
[ __ ] that you saw with a lot of the

---------11:07----------
other people where their students were

---------11:08----------
showing up late or their students were

---------11:11----------
showing up unprepared or any had none of

---------11:13----------
that [ __ ] yet none of that oh I'm

---------11:15----------
sorry my last session ran over but don't

---------11:18----------
worry I'll give you more time never

---------11:20----------
heard those words out of Michael carbons

---------11:21----------
mouth it was just it was a well-oiled

---------11:23----------
machine and I remember him telling me

---------11:25----------
this story and now I'm really deeply

---------11:26----------
paraphrasing because this was this

---------11:28----------
little like ten year old story this one

---------11:30----------
guy showed up late and he offered

---------11:33----------
Michael more money in order to you know

---------11:35----------
in order to accept the session and he

---------11:38----------
pretty much does something like money

---------11:40----------
and he just takes his cigar or something

---------11:43----------
and puts it through the money he's like

---------11:44----------
I don't give a [ __ ] about your money and

---------11:46----------
he throws it away but it really does set

---------11:48----------
the stage for how people treat you had

---------11:50----------
he simply allowed this person to give

---------11:52----------
him an extra 20 bucks because they were

---------11:53----------
late he's setting the stage to my rules

---------11:56----------
matter but they don't matter as much as

---------11:59----------
your extra twenty dollars what type of

---------12:01----------
message are you sending about your

---------12:03----------
business what type of message are you

---------12:04----------
sending about your service when somebody

---------12:06----------
can disrespect you completely not follow

---------12:09----------
the rules that you expect everybody else

---------12:11----------
to follow but then make up for it by

---------12:13----------
giving you an extra 20 bucks it's one of

---------12:16----------
these things and the other things I

---------12:17----------
remember taking away from Michael Carvin

---------12:19----------
were that were the teaching mentalities

---------12:21----------
I remember him saying you know everybody

---------12:24----------
else in that suite and this is one of

---------12:26----------
those things you really got to think

---------12:28----------
about to wrap your head around everybody

---------12:29----------
else okay to play to do this with the

---------12:32----------
drums and then you'll learn they have

---------12:33----------
the student danten danten danten

---------12:36----------
and then he would then you know then the

---------12:39----------
the I'm losing my mind I'm tired or they

---------12:42----------
just thought I was just talking about

---------12:44----------
that oh yeah all the other students

---------12:45----------
would pretty listen to the teacher that

---------12:47----------
she was like this is how you play drums

---------12:48----------
the teacher would play the drums and

---------12:50----------
then they would have the student play

---------12:52----------
the drums and that was what it was like

---------12:55----------
in every room and one of the things I

---------12:57----------
noticed really early on about his school

---------12:59----------
was that Michael Carvin would not have

---------13:02----------
you played the drums but he would be

---------13:04----------
teaching that play the drums I remember

---------13:06----------
he would have these sessions and the

---------13:07----------
person would enter the room for 45

---------13:08----------
minutes to an hour and I would not hear

---------13:11----------
drums being played but the people coming

---------13:13----------
out were better at playing the drums

---------13:15----------
after

---------13:15----------
taking his class like try to wrap your

---------13:17----------
head around that [ __ ] I'm going to teach

---------13:19----------
you how to become a better drummer a

---------13:21----------
better artist without you playing drums

---------13:24----------
and it's not in this out [ __ ] like

---------13:27----------
the people coming out of his class

---------13:28----------
we're better at their craft as a result

---------13:31----------
of it and I took that to heart I took

---------13:33----------
that to heart and tried to apply it to

---------13:35----------
the stuff that I'm trying to teach you

---------13:36----------
here you see you got all these channels

---------13:38----------
with like I'm going to do this I'm going

---------13:41----------
to replace this chip and then they have

---------13:42----------
the techno music in the background and

---------13:44----------
they have it at 5x and all that [ __ ]

---------13:46----------
and they think that you're gonna learn

---------13:48----------
by watching them do something at 5x

---------13:50----------
speed you're going to learn that's not

---------13:54----------
how it works you have to teach a mindset

---------13:57----------
you have to get them into the mindset

---------13:58----------
that is proper for them to be able to

---------14:00----------
actually do what it is you want them to

---------14:02----------
do it's all about the mindset and that

---------14:04----------
was just one of those things that I

---------14:05----------
could not wrap my head around for years

---------14:07----------
but it's something that I try to do with

---------14:09----------
this YouTube channel when I'm going over

---------14:11----------
electronics I don't want you to just sit

---------14:13----------
there and just and just stumble around

---------14:15----------
the go ok put a wire here ok ok now run

---------14:18----------
the wire there ok great so now you fix

---------14:21----------
this with this equip what did I do

---------14:23----------
yeah that's the way a lot of people

---------14:24----------
teach I don't want to teach that way I

---------14:26----------
want to teach you a mindset that's why

---------14:28----------
the lot of people who show up for the

---------14:29----------
tutoring I go ok what would you do here

---------14:31----------
I'm like what and I go what would you do

---------14:33----------
here and like how am I supposed to know

---------14:35----------
and I go well somebody had to figure

---------14:38----------
this out in the beginning so that means

---------14:40----------
that you can figure it out now so I want

---------14:42----------
you to be in this mindset I want you to

---------14:43----------
think about this what do you think what

---------14:45----------
would you check first if a light bulb

---------14:48----------
was not working would you check the you

---------14:51----------
know would you just change the light or

---------14:54----------
would you check to see that there's

---------14:56----------
actual power going to the light any of

---------14:59----------
the animals every single person goes oh

---------15:01----------
I would replace the light bulb and then

---------15:03----------
I say ok what if the light bulb had

---------15:05----------
ninety six point two five millimeter

---------15:08----------
balls attaching it would you then

---------15:10----------
replace the light bulb in a 40-minute

---------15:13----------
process but would you see if 120 volts

---------15:15----------
was getting to the light bulb before you

---------15:18----------
did it and they go man in that case in

---------15:21----------
that case I'd probably want to check if

---------15:23----------
this hundred twenty volts going to the

---------15:24----------
light bulb and that's a really that's

---------15:26----------
probably not the best example just

---------15:27----------
because

---------15:28----------
tired now remembering everything

---------15:30----------
properly but I try to get people into a

---------15:32----------
mindset and I want them to take that

---------15:34----------
mindset and apply it everything they're

---------15:36----------
doing so that rather than rather than

---------15:38----------
have to follow what I said I want them

---------15:40----------
to follow the mindset that I taught them

---------15:42----------
so that they're constantly following

---------15:44----------
themself so that people don't have to

---------15:46----------
ask me Louis I'm in this situation and

---------15:49----------
what do I do

---------15:50----------
I like again III talk about this guy

---------15:52----------
very often and I don't want to put him

---------15:54----------
on the spot but like pizza store dude

---------15:55----------
that guy posting on advance where he

---------15:57----------
works that was either system manager had

---------15:59----------
the pizza store whatever and that dudes

---------16:01----------
not asking me questions he's not asking

---------16:03----------
me about all these other things after we

---------16:04----------
took the course you know why cuz he

---------16:06----------
learned a mindset and he's using that

---------16:07----------
mindset to do things for himself he's

---------16:09----------
using that mindset to uh he's using that

---------16:12----------
mindset to solve his own problem so that

---------16:15----------
he doesn't have to come back to me every

---------16:16----------
single time he has one that's the thing

---------16:18----------
that's what I am trying to teach with

---------16:20----------
these videos I want to teach people a

---------16:22----------
way of thinking so that when they have a

---------16:24----------
problem they don't have to come back to

---------16:26----------
me but they can simply ask their way of

---------16:29----------
thinking that's been instilled in them

---------16:31----------
and then they can then get the answer to

---------16:33----------
their own problem and that's something

---------16:34----------
that I learned from Michael Carvin it

---------16:36----------
wasn't just business that I learned from

---------16:38----------
him wasn't just respect for myself that

---------16:40----------
I learned from him it was just this and

---------16:42----------
this entire this entire mindset and I'm

---------16:45----------
really glad I learned it at a young age

---------16:46----------
because you have these times where

---------16:48----------
people don't respect you or your rules

---------16:49----------
and you have to realize that every part

---------16:53----------
of the business relationship is going to

---------16:54----------
be a [ __ ] like they I may wind up

---------16:57----------
doing a video on this eventually I'm not

---------16:58----------
sure because I just I don't know I just

---------17:00----------
haven't been really up on making videos

---------17:01----------
as much lately as I used to be my head

---------17:03----------
hasn't been in but this is one person we

---------17:06----------
said listen don't check the ticket for

---------17:09----------
status so there's this thing in repair

---------17:10----------
shop at the POS system we use where it's

---------17:12----------
like diagnosed invoiced completed

---------17:14----------
approved all that [ __ ] we don't use it

---------17:16----------
we get approval from the customer we

---------17:18----------
type it in the notes we tell them you're

---------17:19----------
welcome to call at any time however if

---------17:21----------
we have not called you it's not done and

---------17:23----------
this person kept saying listen I keep

---------17:25----------
trying to check the ticket it doesn't

---------17:26----------
say status why doesn't the tickets a

---------17:27----------
status update why doesn't the ticket

---------17:29----------
tell me where you are at the board and

---------17:30----------
the thing is the way that we work I

---------17:32----------
don't put it like I don't have a live

---------17:36----------
system that shows you know oh well Dee

---------17:38----------
6990 was blown and we replaced but

---------17:41----------
there's still a short degree

---------17:41----------
oh now we found the short to ground but

---------17:43----------
now we don't know why it's not turning

---------17:44----------
on okay now we figured out how to make a

---------17:46----------
turn on but now the USB ports like we

---------17:49----------
don't have a status system like that

---------17:50----------
because a it would completely demolish

---------17:53----------
my ability to work efficiently and B it

---------17:57----------
doesn't really [ __ ] matter like does

---------17:59----------
it matter to the end customer if I found

---------18:01----------
one short but it still doesn't work to

---------18:03----------
them the only thing that matters is does

---------18:05----------
it work that's all that matters and if

---------18:08----------
it works this second it [ __ ] works

---------18:11----------
you bet your ass I'm calling them an

---------18:12----------
emailing them to tell them that it's

---------18:13----------
done it's not like I want them to have

---------18:16----------
to check status to see that it's done I

---------18:17----------
don't want people to check status to see

---------18:20----------
if it's done like it a second it's done

---------18:23----------
I should be have been calling them I

---------18:25----------
should have emailed them I should have

---------18:27----------
reached out to them so they'll know and

---------18:28----------
this person look and we said we welcome

---------18:30----------
to call and he just keeps emailing he's

---------18:32----------
like hey man the statuses more came in

---------18:34----------
the status system is working and we kept

---------18:36----------
him as a customer because he was paying

---------18:37----------
money right and just this morning I get

---------18:39----------
this whole thing on like how oh you're

---------18:41----------
like you're you're a Trump type and you

---------18:44----------
guys have no passion you don't like us

---------18:46----------
and you know you don't know what you're

---------18:47----------
doing blah blah just just all this

---------18:49----------
[ __ ] because I didn't respect myself

---------18:52----------
I wasn't listening to my own advice I

---------18:55----------
have a very basic set of rules you will

---------18:57----------
hear from us two to five days after you

---------18:59----------
send a board in for repair if you're

---------19:01----------
another service center and the status

---------19:04----------
update that you receive will be when we

---------19:06----------
call you to tell you it's done if you'd

---------19:08----------
like to call at any given time you're

---------19:10----------
welcome to but this online ticket system

---------19:12----------
does not have status for border pairs

---------19:14----------
that's not the way we work do you accept

---------19:16----------
these terms and rules and if they say

---------19:17----------
yes we have a good relationship if they

---------19:19----------
say yes but then show me that they're

---------19:21----------
ignoring that I it doesn't work you know

---------19:26----------
the business cannot work if people show

---------19:28----------
you upfront that they don't have respect

---------19:30----------
for your rules or the way you do

---------19:32----------
business and that's totally ok you're

---------19:34----------
welcome to take your cigar and put it

---------19:36----------
through their money and give it back to

---------19:37----------
them

---------19:38----------
I didn't take my cigar and I don't smoke

---------19:40----------
cigars and put it through the guys

---------19:41----------
certified check but I did give it back

---------19:43----------
to them and I was as polite as can be

---------19:44----------
and saying explaining to him why I

---------19:46----------
cannot work with them so it's important

---------19:49----------
to have respect for your rules it's

---------19:51----------
important to have to make sure that

---------19:53----------
others have respect for your

---------19:55----------
rulz and it's just it's just a way of

---------19:57----------
looking at things like michael Carvin

---------19:59----------
was explaining make all these people are

---------20:00----------
out you know they just think that if

---------20:01----------
they do these things in there that the

---------20:04----------
easy money is going to be out there for

---------20:06----------
them but when you have that mindset when

---------20:08----------
you have that mindset of just not of

---------20:11----------
letting others trample over your rules

---------20:12----------
then you're not building a business with

---------20:15----------
dignity or not building something that's

---------20:16----------
going to last and he was a

---------20:18----------
multi-millionaire from his early 20s so

---------20:21----------
I mean yeah I'd rather take his advice

---------20:23----------
than the advice of everybody else that's

---------20:25----------
like yeah to be a professional you need

---------20:27----------
to do this that and the other when they

---------20:29----------
haven't accomplished jack-shit I'd

---------20:30----------
rather take the advice from the very

---------20:33----------
intelligent person who is very

---------20:34----------
accomplished who actually earned respect

---------20:36----------
by respecting himself and making sure

---------20:39----------
others respected the rules that he had

---------20:41----------
it's something that can be applied so

---------20:42----------
many different items in business and the

---------20:44----------
whole thing with teaching again that

---------20:46----------
that just blew my mind I like about

---------20:48----------
teaching a mindset they just realizing

---------20:50----------
that students were paying him to learn

---------20:52----------
how to play drums by walking into his

---------20:54----------
room with a drum kit and you didn't hear

---------20:57----------
drums being played

---------20:58----------
I heard drums being played in his room

---------21:00----------
like three times in two [ __ ] years

---------21:02----------
seriously it was just it's one of those

---------21:04----------
things that like when I finally managed

---------21:06----------
to wrap my head around it it just helped

---------21:10----------
me so much in my ability to actually

---------21:11----------
teach others and you know my again my

---------21:15----------
business the way it is right now the

---------21:17----------
YouTube channel the way it is right now

---------21:18----------
if I hadn't met him it would not be here

---------21:21----------
so one of the things I'd really like to

---------21:23----------
do going into the future is I'd actually

---------21:25----------
like to be able to interview these

---------21:26----------
people that have helped me in my life

---------21:28----------
the people that kind of help shape my

---------21:29----------
business shape my life and help just

---------21:31----------
help me build the things that I've built

---------21:32----------
I'd like to actually go back and

---------21:34----------
interview these people in person and ask

---------21:37----------
them a lot of the questions that the the

---------21:38----------
people on the channel have it's

---------21:40----------
something that I may wind up coming up

---------21:41----------
with in a future video but if anybody

---------21:43----------
here has questions if they'd like to ask

---------21:44----------
this gentleman questions something that

---------21:46----------
I really think I'm going to reach out to

---------21:47----------
them about please do ask them in the

---------21:50----------
comments below or just matches them to

---------21:52----------
me because again I don't want you to

---------21:53----------
just see my viewpoint I want you to see

---------21:55----------
the viewpoints of other people who are

---------21:57----------
far more successful and far more

---------21:58----------
accomplished than I am on this channel

---------22:00----------
because what I'm doing is I'm not really

---------22:02----------
necessarily relying just my thoughts

---------22:04----------
when I talk to you and I'm explaining

---------22:06----------
concepts in the core philosophies and

---------22:08----------
rants in the

---------22:08----------
his talk videos I'm trying to relay to

---------22:11----------
you the things that I learned from

---------22:12----------
people who were far smarter than me

---------22:14----------
the ROI Hendrickson's the Rickey begins

---------22:16----------
in the Michael carvings it's not all

---------22:17----------
stuff that came from me it's it's what

---------22:19----------
came from people who are much smarter

---------22:21----------
and much more accomplished than me

---------22:23----------
I may be explaining it through my own

---------22:24----------
filter because I'm explaining it through

---------22:26----------
the I guess the bias of how I've lived

---------22:30----------
my own life and how I've lit and how I

---------22:31----------
have applied their advice but it is

---------22:34----------
their advice it is their mindset and I

---------22:37----------
don't know I think would be useful to a

---------22:38----------
lot of the people who are starting their

---------22:40----------
own businesses or going off into their

---------22:42----------
own things in life to hear what these

---------22:43----------
people have to say so yeah you know what

---------22:46----------
I'm going to contact him when I'm done

---------22:47----------
with this video and I'm going to ask him

---------22:49----------
if he'd like to do an interview because

---------22:51----------
I really think that he would have a lot

---------22:53----------
to teach everybody who watches this

---------22:54----------
channel they
