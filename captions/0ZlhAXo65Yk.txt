---------00:00----------
all right everybody how's it going so

---------00:01----------
we're gonna go over a few things before

---------00:03----------
we get to our standard day of repairs

---------00:05----------
the first thing is that I realized that

---------00:06----------
my problem here is actually threefold a

---------00:09----------
spectrum business seems to allow me to

---------00:12----------
upload SSH FTP to my apartment at the

---------00:15----------
full 20 megabit per second however when

---------00:17----------
I upload to youtube funny how that 20

---------00:19----------
megabit per second starts lagging until

---------00:21----------
I put this dream below 3 megabits per

---------00:23----------
second not only is my time warner cable

---------00:25----------
complete garbage so in spite of the fact

---------00:27----------
that my traffic seems to being throttled

---------00:29----------
to some extent because it would we can

---------00:30----------
upload the Homa 20 megabit per second I

---------00:32----------
couldn't upload to Google more than

---------00:33----------
three megabit per second imagine that I

---------00:35----------
also had the issue of constant outages

---------00:37----------
where I can't upload to anything at all

---------00:39----------
so that was the second issue that I was

---------00:41----------
having that was really confusing so you

---------00:43----------
had the first issue of Time Warner

---------00:45----------
giving me a faster path to my home via

---------00:46----------
SSH FTP then they were giving me the

---------00:49----------
YouTube or reached or any of these video

---------00:51----------
services directly so I set up the VPN

---------00:52----------
this thing was pretty good it was 80

---------00:53----------
bucks for two years again I'm not

---------00:56----------
sponsored and I don't get paid by these

---------00:57----------
people I'm I know but it's it works and

---------01:00----------
I hope to have helped have somebody help

---------01:02----------
me set that up with pfsense the second

---------01:04----------
thing that I need to solve here is the

---------01:06----------
the the Internet's going down constantly

---------01:09----------
so I have the Verizon and Time Warner

---------01:11----------
Time Warner sucks a lot but Pete my

---------01:13----------
pfsense router which switches over to

---------01:15----------
Verizon DSL when the Time Warner goes

---------01:16----------
out can no longer switch over to Verizon

---------01:18----------
DSL there was a fire in the building and

---------01:20----------
as a result all the wiring was destroyed

---------01:22----------
they were still billing me in spite of

---------01:23----------
the fact that the wiring was destroyed

---------01:24----------
they were asking me to reset my modem

---------01:27----------
constantly on the phone even when they

---------01:30----------
knew that the wiring and infrastructure

---------01:31----------
to get DSL in here is gone the copper

---------01:34----------
why all that stuff is burned to [ __ ] and

---------01:36----------
the guy on the phone was still saying oh

---------01:38----------
reset the modem tonight and reset the

---------01:40----------
modem try login to your modem unplug

---------01:43----------
deeply ah I want to bang my head against

---------01:45----------
the wall so hard but to alter the best

---------01:47----------
part of that is I was still being built

---------01:48----------
for the entire time and it took several

---------01:50----------
calls to Verizon to get them to stop

---------01:52----------
billing me for DSL that doesn't work

---------01:53----------
because of burned wiring so I don't have

---------01:55----------
a secondary internet connection anymore

---------01:56----------
so I want to get something like this now

---------01:58----------
the third issue that I was having that I

---------02:00----------
wasn't anticipating

---------02:01----------
was with my PC build imagine imagine

---------02:03----------
that Lois messed up in building his PC

---------02:05----------
so the third issue is that my PC I have

---------02:09----------
this shitty inner Mac slick tech TR for

---------02:11----------
the second version of the CPU

---------02:13----------
cooller not the first version I got the

---------02:15----------
second version one that's supposed to be

---------02:16----------
fixed

---------02:17----------
it ain't fixed every now and then it

---------02:18----------
makes funny noises and my CPU will just

---------02:20----------
start idling at 65 Celsius it's very

---------02:23----------
aggravating and I think that was causing

---------02:25----------
some of the pixelated video you were

---------02:26----------
seeing yesterday so you and you also may

---------02:28----------
hear that every now and then my fans go

---------02:30----------
to 3,000 rpm to make up for the fact

---------02:33----------
that the inner max is pump is not

---------02:34----------
working so it thinks oh crap make the

---------02:36----------
fans go faster but that's not gonna work

---------02:37----------
if the pump is not not working so this

---------02:39----------
is what I wound up ordering from this

---------02:42----------
performance PC website did the last part

---------02:44----------
of my PC that was pathetic was that

---------02:46----------
piece of [ __ ] enter max all in one

---------02:47----------
liquid cooler so I got this thing you

---------02:49----------
could probably hear it shooting up again

---------02:51----------
so I think that by the end of the week

---------02:52----------
when I have an LTE backup I have my VPN

---------02:55----------
setup at pfSense properly and this

---------02:57----------
machine is not a burning anymore then I

---------02:59----------
will finally be able to do live streams

---------03:01----------
regularly without fuck-ups now I am I am

---------03:05----------
a greedy greedy capitalist so if you

---------03:06----------
would like to help me with the stream

---------03:08----------
upgrades Here I am selling some things

---------03:10----------
I'm going around the store and finding

---------03:12----------
stuff that I'd no longer need and

---------03:13----------
getting rid of it so this has been

---------03:16----------
sitting on my monitor for quite a while

---------03:17----------
I got some g.skill 14 14 14 34 Rams so I

---------03:21----------
don't really need this stuff anymore

---------03:23----------
so if you would like today if you like

---------03:26----------
if you like Louis's yard sale of

---------03:27----------
starting so over here you'll notice that

---------03:29----------
we have some very unique [ __ ] apple Ram

---------03:33----------
so this is $400 for 64 gigabytes of ddr4

---------03:37----------
[ __ ] Apple Ram this Ram it do not

---------03:41----------
confuse [ __ ] Apple RAM with apple Ram

---------03:44----------
the difference between apple Ram so the

---------03:46----------
difference that you have between Apple

---------03:48----------
Ram and [ __ ] Apple Ram is that apple Ram

---------03:52----------
will work in an apple macbook however

---------03:54----------
[ __ ] Apple Ram will not work in an apple

---------03:56----------
macbook so this is [ __ ] Apple RAM I have

---------03:59----------
written [ __ ] Apple on each of the dims

---------04:01----------
some of them say [ __ ] AAPL as in the

---------04:03----------
stock some say [ __ ] a ppl E as in I

---------04:06----------
actually thought I could spell it out

---------04:07----------
but didn't realize there was only eight

---------04:08----------
chips instead of nine so this here is

---------04:11----------
genuine genuine OEM [ __ ] Apple RAM

---------04:15----------
straight from Rossman repair and if you

---------04:18----------
purchase this it will make my wallet cry

---------04:20----------
a tiny bit less at spending money out of

---------04:22----------
EPN spending money on somebody who's

---------04:24----------
gonna help fix my pfSense router at the

---------04:26----------
store

---------04:27----------
and buying this this thing ISA and

---------04:30----------
paying for internet so that my streams

---------04:32----------
will not stop going down from the 500

---------04:34----------
$480 a month in and I'm already paying

---------04:36----------
for and it will also help funds the the

---------04:39----------
water cooling [ __ ] I got so that my

---------04:41----------
computer will stop getting this will

---------04:44----------
stop do being annoying I got this thing

---------04:46----------
with overnight shipping so hopefully I

---------04:48----------
get it tomorrow and Mikey may do a

---------04:49----------
stream of that one thing you may notice

---------04:51----------
and store it out rossmann group comm is

---------04:52----------
there is only one in stock this is a

---------04:56----------
limited edition you will never see this

---------04:58----------
again this is a limited edition [ __ ]

---------05:01----------
apple Ram

---------05:01----------
hundreds of millions of people have

---------05:03----------
Apple RAM but you today can be the first

---------05:06----------
and only person in the world to have

---------05:07----------
[ __ ] Apple Ram think about it you may

---------05:10----------
not know what the timings of this memory

---------05:12----------
are you may not know what the bandwidth

---------05:13----------
of this memory is you may not even know

---------05:15----------
who makes the RAM chips because I can't

---------05:17----------
see if it says al Qaeda or Samsung or

---------05:18----------
micron on it I can't tell who makes the

---------05:20----------
chips but what I can tell you is that

---------05:22----------
it's [ __ ] Apple Ram all right today

---------05:24----------
we're gonna be working on another

---------05:25----------
MacBook this is an a 1398 MacBook it has

---------05:29----------
liquid damage it won't turn on and needs

---------05:32----------
to be fixed let's open this MacBook up

---------05:45----------
and see what it looks like on the inside

---------05:48----------
the inside of this MacBook Chris has

---------05:56----------
give it as Paul Daniels that called uses

---------05:58----------
Arvid Chris said Caroline who would want

---------06:01----------
to talk to that face Carolyn's not

---------06:05----------
calling me she's not calling me from a

---------06:07----------
646 number Carolyn's not calling me from

---------06:11----------
a 646 number you troll also carolyn is a

---------06:17----------
female which means she probably doesn't

---------06:20----------
exist remember a girl is an acronym on a

---------06:24----------
motherboard repair channel girl is

---------06:26----------
acronym for guy in real life do not

---------06:29----------
trust anybody that claims to be a girl

---------06:31----------
on a motherboard repair channel is to

---------06:33----------
think that Jessa was a woman and then I

---------06:35----------
started teaching class with her and I

---------06:37----------
realized that she would say suck my dick

---------06:39----------
10 times more than every man that I knew

---------06:41----------
combined

---------06:42----------
so even Jessa even Jessa guy in real

---------06:45----------
life just got to inspect further guy in

---------06:56----------
real life guy in real life why call the

---------07:00----------
shop after hours it's it's fine leave a

---------07:02----------
voicemail it's cool hang up and call

---------07:04----------
back when the voicemail says we closed

---------07:06----------
at 8:00 that just makes you a [ __ ]

---------07:08----------
okay so we'd have done here is we are

---------07:13----------
going to unplug the battery and see how

---------07:15----------
much amperage is taken when I first plug

---------07:16----------
it in do realize that the amount of

---------07:19----------
power that a board is taking is going to

---------07:20----------
tell me a lot 200 milliamps short on P P

---------07:23----------
bus 100 milliamps all says power good

---------07:26----------
circuit not working 20 milliamps p.m.

---------07:28----------
sleep s4l missing / John Paul's desk

---------07:30----------
different amounts of power being drawn

---------07:32----------
again I tell me different things about

---------07:34----------
the machine so I want to know exactly

---------07:36----------
how much power the board by itself over

---------07:38----------
here is taking I want to know what the

---------07:40----------
board is taking but I cannot know what

---------07:42----------
the board is taking if the batteries

---------07:44----------
plugged in because the battery is going

---------07:46----------
to take different amounts of power so

---------07:48----------
what do I mean when I said the batteries

---------07:49----------
gonna take different amounts of power

---------07:50----------
what I mean is that if the battery is

---------07:53----------
almost fully charged it's probably going

---------07:55----------
to take only one or two hundred

---------07:56----------
milliamps or as if the battery is not

---------07:58----------
charged at all it may take three to four

---------08:00----------
amps so since the end since the power

---------08:02----------
supply is just telling me how much power

---------08:04----------
is the machine as a whole is drawing I

---------08:06----------
can't tell how much the board is taking

---------08:08----------
by itself when I have an external

---------08:09----------
variable like the battery there because

---------08:11----------
the battery is taking a different amount

---------08:13----------
of amperage depending on how much it's

---------08:14----------
charged so I unplug the battery and then

---------08:16----------
I plug the machine in and the first

---------08:17----------
thing I notice here is that this charge

---------08:21----------
port is wiggling this wobbles around so

---------08:23----------
what this tells me is that this has been

---------08:24----------
opened by an idiot because this should

---------08:26----------
not wobble around so most likely the

---------08:28----------
long screw is put in the short hole and

---------08:30----------
if the long screw is put in the short

---------08:32----------
hole the long screw is put in the other

---------08:34----------
holes as well

---------08:38----------
you know I did not have the courage to

---------08:41----------
kick your ass directly but I could you

---------08:44----------
know you know I'm involved with black

---------08:47----------
magic you know you're going to have

---------08:50----------
another accident so we're looking at

---------08:52----------
this around one o'clock tomorrow by the

---------08:54----------
way so this one's I think three thousand

---------08:56----------
dollars in the one next to it is thirty

---------08:57----------
five hundred dollars and they're only a

---------08:59----------
few blocks away so I'm thinking of

---------09:00----------
renting these as separate spaces yeah so

---------09:05----------
look at this there's a lot of potential

---------09:09----------
here because again if they want if they

---------09:11----------
want through 3,500 bucks of space I'll

---------09:13----------
jump at that immediately it's I'll take

---------09:16----------
two of them I don't even know what to do

---------09:17----------
with the second store I'll just I'll

---------09:18----------
just take even though it's a little bit

---------09:20----------
of a fixer-upper this is New York and

---------09:22----------
most like if you go looking for a space

---------09:25----------
like that you're gonna hear stuff like

---------09:27----------
from my the [ __ ] owners of this

---------09:28----------
building that one at 27 $1,000 for a

---------09:32----------
space a few blocks down from me that's a

---------09:33----------
tiny bit larger what a [ __ ] face thing I

---------09:35----------
can't have I told you how much I don't

---------09:37----------
like the people that own this building

---------09:38----------
I really don't like the people who own

---------09:40----------
this building I genuinely despise them

---------09:42----------
hey Louis oh what's that you have no

---------09:45----------
heat and at seven degrees outside

---------09:46----------
sure we'll get back to you two weeks

---------09:49----------
later you bring my heaters that are the

---------09:51----------
equivalent of somebody going in front of

---------09:53----------
a lighter and I went to the people who

---------09:55----------
you know the owners of the building and

---------09:57----------
I said I get that most places in New

---------09:58----------
York City MO they don't when they buy a

---------10:01----------
building they look to sit on it for ten

---------10:02----------
years

---------10:03----------
sell it at a markup and keep typic you

---------10:06----------
know keep it empty so that they don't

---------10:07----------
have to deal with higher property taxes

---------10:10----------
or tenants that are gonna mess with it

---------10:12----------
or they're just gonna look for the

---------10:14----------
Chasen starbucks kind of tenant I

---------10:15----------
totally get that and if you're looking

---------10:18----------
to do that here that's fine just let me

---------10:19----------
know but if you're not looking to do

---------10:21----------
that and you want to rent me the space

---------10:23----------
next door and extend my lease I will

---------10:25----------
renovate the space to make it look more

---------10:27----------
pristine than an Apple store both of

---------10:29----------
these spaces I will tear them down I

---------10:30----------
will gut them I will start from scratch

---------10:31----------
I'll make sure they look beautiful and

---------10:33----------
that it increases the property value of

---------10:35----------
the building just let me know what you'd

---------10:36----------
like to do and rather than be a man and

---------10:39----------
say no we would rather just get rid of

---------10:41----------
you as soon as the lease is up rather

---------10:42----------
than have any sense of rather than have

---------10:46----------
any kind of balls to for genuine human

---------10:49----------
honesty or interaction they

---------10:50----------
the guy doesn't come each out to me he

---------10:54----------
has some low-level staffer reach out to

---------10:55----------
me and say we would like to offer you

---------10:58----------
the courtesy of I want to read the exact

---------11:01----------
email I don't know who you spoke to at

---------11:03----------
hub but I am talking about a different

---------11:04----------
space across the street at 131 First

---------11:06----------
Avenue that's what I was talking about I

---------11:09----------
wanted to give you the courtesy of

---------11:10----------
discussing a possibly completely new

---------11:12----------
lease because of all that happened at

---------11:13----------
186 first Avenue I think you may love

---------11:15----------
the space I'm talking about so hope you

---------11:16----------
can discuss further like you couldn't

---------11:18----------
tell me yourself that you don't want to

---------11:21----------
give me the space you just you couldn't

---------11:23----------
that you couldn't tell me yourself that

---------11:24----------
I couldn´t take the space next door you

---------11:25----------
couldn't tell me hey you know we don't

---------11:27----------
really want people like you here we

---------11:29----------
don't want people that don't want to pay

---------11:31----------
thirty thousand dollars for a box here

---------11:32----------
just just be honest you couldn't even

---------11:35----------
say that to me face to face

---------11:36----------
you had to send your [ __ ] barrel you

---------11:39----------
know newly graduated college assistant

---------11:42----------
to me to say to ignore my question and

---------11:45----------
then offer me a space that's $27,000 I

---------11:49----------
asked you about the space next door ask

---------11:50----------
I asked you about extending the lease

---------11:52----------
here [ __ ]

---------11:53----------
I did not [ __ ] ask you about a hole

---------11:56----------
in the wall for 27 thousand [ __ ]

---------11:58----------
dollars and like I did this I blew my

---------12:01----------
stack when I read the courtesy part I

---------12:03----------
absolutely blew my stack at reading the

---------12:05----------
courtesy partner okay

---------12:06----------
so the building went on fire most likely

---------12:08----------
because the sushi place next door had an

---------12:10----------
accident because they had a high-rent at

---------12:13----------
least they were stuck in and no

---------12:14----------
customers and there was a fire fire and

---------12:16----------
then there was no heat for several

---------12:18----------
months and when we asked is there

---------12:19----------
anything you can do in terms of electric

---------12:21----------
heat or getting the gas turned on

---------12:22----------
anything if you just can't get the gas

---------12:23----------
turned back on can you bring us some

---------12:24----------
heaters or something you ignore us for

---------12:26----------
two weeks and then two weeks later you

---------12:28----------
bring these [ __ ] little these hair

---------12:30----------
dryers that you probably couldn't even

---------12:32----------
reflow with goddamn GPU with because of

---------12:35----------
all that as a courtesy for your basement

---------12:38----------
being flooded all as a courtesy we're

---------12:40----------
gonna offer you a $27,000 space that's

---------12:44----------
like teeny tiny bit bigger than the one

---------12:45----------
you have now [ __ ] you building owners

---------12:48----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] you in the ass I was very

---------12:51----------
nice when I went to the office very nice

---------12:53----------
but not genuinely got me nowhere now if

---------12:55----------
you take a look at where the long screws

---------12:57----------
were you see how it kind of scrapes the

---------12:59----------
board down there so do you see how this

---------13:01----------
is a screw hole indentation

---------13:04----------
on the board itself this is what long

---------13:06----------
screw does and that's why you should

---------13:08----------
never put the long screw in the short

---------13:10----------
hole hey once there Apple certified

---------13:11----------
that's actually a cool idea I can have

---------13:13----------
two stores side by side and one would be

---------13:15----------
Apple certified one not Apple certified

---------13:16----------
so we could have like red pill blue pill

---------13:18----------
what do you guys think of that actually

---------13:20----------
know this Wow

---------13:21----------
well okay let's let's do this what those

---------13:24----------
two stores that I just showed you we

---------13:25----------
have the blue pill and the red pill go

---------13:27----------
left Apple tell you buy a new one go

---------13:29----------
right to get the truth okay now here's

---------13:31----------
what the second question comes in is it

---------13:32----------
worth paying $7,000 a month to have a

---------13:36----------
meme store because at this point that

---------13:38----------
those two stores would exist purely as a

---------13:40----------
meme

---------13:41----------
so we'd have Apple Authorized and Apple

---------13:44----------
unauthorized and they would be right

---------13:46----------
next to each other one store could be

---------13:47----------
also the theme the paint the sign could

---------13:50----------
all be blue and the other store the

---------13:52----------
scene the theme the sign would all be

---------13:54----------
red so this would actually be like red

---------13:58----------
pill blue pill do you want the lies or

---------14:00----------
do you want the truth do you want to

---------14:02----------
understand think that the reason that

---------14:04----------
your machine has no graphics is because

---------14:05----------
you were using it wrong or holding it

---------14:07----------
wrong do you think the reason your

---------14:09----------
machine has no graphics is because we

---------14:10----------
didn't you know our you 8900 is coming

---------14:13----------
desolder from the board because our

---------14:15----------
board [ __ ] flexes inside the housing

---------14:17----------
of a $3,000 machine this is such a

---------14:21----------
terrible way to spend money as a

---------14:23----------
business owner but man that would be so

---------14:25----------
cool meme store okay now the only thing

---------14:29----------
is everything I could afford I could pay

---------14:31----------
that I could you know again adding seven

---------14:33----------
thousand a month to the company right

---------14:34----------
there's no big deal

---------14:35----------
adding twenty thousand a month of the

---------14:37----------
company rent that that's not happening

---------14:39----------
but I think that we would make more

---------14:41----------
money if I had those two spaces we'd be

---------14:42----------
able to take on more items we'd be able

---------14:44----------
to do things faster we'd be able to do

---------14:46----------
inventory checks quicker I could add

---------14:48----------
items to the store faster I think would

---------14:50----------
be great I think I could make up the

---------14:52----------
money for that the issue that I have

---------14:53----------
with that idea is how am I going to have

---------14:56----------
an Apple Authorized repair shop because

---------14:58----------
if I apply to be Apple Authorized even

---------15:00----------
if I take all the certifications and I

---------15:01----------
and I take all the license tests or

---------15:03----------
whatever the hell there is and I pass

---------15:05----------
all that there's no way in hell

---------15:07----------
my name is getting Apple Authorized so I

---------15:10----------
need to find somebody who was already

---------15:12----------
Apple Authorized

---------15:13----------
who would be willing to loan me that

---------15:14----------
certification or allow me to use that

---------15:18----------
as as part of my meme store so if

---------15:20----------
anybody runs an Apple Authorized service

---------15:23----------
providers shop would they be willing to

---------15:25----------
allow me to use their name and have my

---------15:28----------
company deal with everything in that

---------15:30----------
location right next to my unauthorized

---------15:33----------
location so one location would be this

---------15:35----------
location would stay in those two stores

---------15:36----------
that I showed you you'd have one store

---------15:38----------
that's where Paul and Camille and Mikey

---------15:41----------
are gonna be dealing with shipping

---------15:42----------
receiving mailings and sending out

---------15:43----------
mailings and they would be they're not

---------15:45----------
exactly customer service people but they

---------15:46----------
would be dealing with the customer

---------15:47----------
directly and right next door to it I

---------15:50----------
would need to have a store where that

---------15:52----------
was under somebody else's company name

---------15:54----------
who's already Apple Authorized so I

---------15:56----------
would need to find somebody who was

---------15:57----------
Apple it was an Apple authorized service

---------15:59----------
provider who would be willing to allow

---------16:01----------
me to use their name for my meme store

---------16:03----------
and then we could do red pill blue pill

---------16:05----------
this does not make business sense but

---------16:06----------
this makes memes sense and think about

---------16:09----------
New York as a tourist location too so

---------16:11----------
this could be one of the places that you

---------16:13----------
go to if you're going to New York and

---------16:14----------
you're going to we could make this

---------16:16----------
amazing we could do is we could go

---------16:18----------
through the Apple handbook of how to

---------16:19----------
deal with customers so somebody's told

---------16:21----------
me that there's a handbook out there

---------16:22----------
that says how you're supposed to talk to

---------16:24----------
customers vocabulary you can use

---------16:25----------
vocabulary you can't use and I'm not

---------16:28----------
saying that anybody should ever email me

---------16:29----------
a copy of that because that would be

---------16:30----------
wrong it Lewis at rossmann group calm

---------16:32----------
its liu is at our OS SMA n and gr OUP

---------16:34----------
comm identity will be protected your

---------16:36----------
anonymity will be guaranteed that being

---------16:38----------
spent you should never email me stuff

---------16:40----------
like that because but if you were to

---------16:41----------
email me something like that we could

---------16:43----------
have t-shirts in the blue pill store

---------16:45----------
that say the things that Apple says when

---------16:47----------
you go to the store I'm sorry we cannot

---------16:49----------
do that but would you like to buy

---------16:50----------
another one we can have all the things

---------16:51----------
that they say on t-shirts in the blue

---------16:54----------
pill Apple store that will be right next

---------16:55----------
to the red pill Apple store we can have

---------16:57----------
somebody there who is dressed like a

---------16:58----------
genius and that would be a person that

---------17:00----------
has gone through the Apple authorized

---------17:02----------
service provider certification process

---------17:04----------
and you could buy merchandise at that

---------17:06----------
store we could tell kilted tim-ki shirts

---------17:12----------
this is an 8 to 0 - 37 87 macbook so

---------17:16----------
we're not getting a green light in the

---------17:17----------
charger the first rail that we need to

---------17:19----------
get a green light on the charger is

---------17:21----------
going to be pp 3 v 4 to underscore G 3

---------17:24----------
hot so I'm gonna turn on Paul Daniels

---------17:25----------
the software gets it going on the screen

---------17:27----------
now the first rail that we need is pp 3

---------17:29----------
V 4 to underscore G 3 hot because

---------17:31----------
you look at the charge board over here

---------17:33----------
you look at the charge port over here

---------17:35----------
you'll notice charge port J 7,000 max

---------17:41----------
AFDC power jack that has a signal called

---------17:45----------
adapter sense adapter sense is going to

---------17:47----------
go to this chip this chip allows the

---------17:49----------
adapter sense line to speak to the

---------17:51----------
system management controller this chip

---------17:53----------
over here the system management

---------17:54----------
controller is what manages the system

---------17:55----------
duh turns on the charger and this chip

---------17:57----------
is not going to turn on unless it gets

---------17:58----------
PP 3 V 4 2 from this chip so PP 3 before

---------18:00----------
2 is the first rail that we need for

---------18:02----------
anything in the system work okay so

---------18:04----------
we're getting 3 point 4 volts so we have

---------18:06----------
3 point 4 volts at PP 3 before to the

---------18:09----------
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going

---------18:10----------
to go down my list the power rows and

---------18:11----------
check it by pp bus is there so my PP bus

---------18:14----------
is supposed to be G 3 hot right let's

---------18:16----------
see if it's G 3 hot or G 3 not twelve

---------18:21----------
point three now twelve point three volts

---------18:24----------
tells me that my SMC is not running so

---------18:25----------
the SMC over here is going to be what is

---------18:28----------
going to speak to my charger to tell it

---------18:30----------
to turn on

---------18:30----------
so here adapter sense goes into u 7000

---------18:33----------
and then u 7,000 is going to allow the

---------18:35----------
adapter sense line to speak with the SMC

---------18:37----------
chip which is at sis 1 wire on this is

---------18:41----------
one wireline Tilted Kim good stuff and

---------18:45----------
this over here is the SMC now the SMC

---------18:50----------
this chip is going to have communication

---------18:52----------
with several different chips so the SMC

---------18:54----------
is not only going to speak to the

---------18:56----------
charger it's also going to speak to

---------18:58----------
another chip that makes the primary

---------19:01----------
system voltage from the charger so let

---------19:03----------
me just show you how that works so over

---------19:05----------
here you have the SMC and it has a data

---------19:07----------
line with this chip called a battery

---------19:08----------
charger use 7100 which Apple lists is

---------19:12----------
use is L six two five eight rather than

---------19:14----------
six two five nine because whoever made

---------19:15----------
the schematic is drunk now if we take a

---------19:18----------
look at that chip that makes PP bunch d3

---------19:19----------
hot which is the rail that we're just

---------19:20----------
looking at not only does it have a data

---------19:23----------
line with the SMC yet this has a data

---------19:28----------
line with the SMC this triptan has a

---------19:30----------
data line with the SMC creates PP bus g3

---------19:32----------
hot now one thing that we've come to

---------19:34----------
notice over the years is that if the SMC

---------19:35----------
is working and it's on it speaks to you

---------19:38----------
seventy one hundred and says hey hi how

---------19:40----------
are you can you give us twelve point six

---------19:41----------
volts instead of twelve point three and

---------19:43----------
when it doesn't work it doesn't say

---------19:45----------
that's a

---------19:46----------
you 7100 so when I measure PP much d3

---------19:48----------
hot and this says that we're only

---------19:49----------
getting 12 point 3 volts rather than 12

---------19:51----------
point 6 volts what that does is it tells

---------19:53----------
me the SMC is not on and that it does

---------19:55----------
need to be turned on in order for things

---------19:57----------
to work so let's take a look over at the

---------19:59----------
SMC area and see what it looks like come

---------20:01----------
this is pretty pretty clean looking now

---------20:04----------
the next thing I'm gonna want to do is

---------20:05----------
check in the the reset circuit here to

---------20:08----------
see if it's actually being told to turn

---------20:09----------
on so let's check the SMC reset circuit

---------20:11----------
now what is an SMC reset circuit the SMC

---------20:13----------
as I said is powered by pp 3 v 4 - now

---------20:16----------
pp 3 before - is the first rail to turn

---------20:18----------
on in the machine and it's going to take

---------20:20----------
a little bit of time for that rail to

---------20:21----------
stabilize if the SMC automatically turns

---------20:23----------
on as soon as that rail comes on it's

---------20:26----------
gonna crash because the SA because that

---------20:28----------
rail is not gonna be three-point-four

---------20:29----------
it's gonna be me 2 volts when it starts

---------20:30----------
or 4 6 whatever the quarter of a second

---------20:32----------
it takes for that rail to stabilize for

---------20:34----------
that microsecond it takes to stabilize

---------20:35----------
is still enough to set the SMC off and

---------20:38----------
cause it to crash as it tries to turn on

---------20:40----------
so there's a chip over here and with the

---------20:43----------
point being of this chip what this chip

---------20:44----------
is gonna do is it's going to make sure

---------20:46----------
that the SMC doesn't turn on until SMC

---------20:49----------
reset L is pulled up so the underscore L

---------20:52----------
when you see this next to a signal

---------20:53----------
underscore L means this signal is only

---------20:56----------
present when the voltage is low so the

---------20:58----------
SMC will be reset when that voltage is

---------21:01----------
low if the voltage is zero or 0.5 the

---------21:04----------
SMC will be reset if that signals three

---------21:06----------
point four volts the SMC is going to not

---------21:08----------
be reset and it will work so think of

---------21:11----------
this like you're holding down the power

---------21:12----------
button and that's all about you're

---------21:14----------
holding down the reset button on a

---------21:15----------
desktop PC if you hold down the reset

---------21:17----------
button on the desktop PC it's not going

---------21:19----------
to post the same is true here now if you

---------21:22----------
take a look you'll see that there's a

---------21:24----------
pull-up resistor that is making sure

---------21:25----------
that the three point four volts is

---------21:28----------
always present on SMC reset l however

---------21:33----------
you 7100 is then going to take that and

---------21:36----------
pull it down it's going to pull that

---------21:38----------
signal down and keep it there for about

---------21:40----------
a quarter of a second so we're gonna see

---------21:42----------
if SMC reset L is present on this board

---------21:45----------
and we can find SMC reset L in this area

---------21:48----------
around the SMC right over here so let's

---------21:51----------
see what's present

---------22:00----------
digressing is all you do it says Paul

---------22:02----------
Daniels I don't never come back to that

---------22:09----------
I real Eric genuinely deveneux come back

---------22:19----------
to that I don't know if I should be

---------22:22----------
offended complimented really kind of

---------22:25----------
confused all right so we have three

---------22:28----------
point four volts in SMC reset so this is

---------22:30----------
where this starts to get tricky so the

---------22:32----------
SMC is being told to turn on the SMC

---------22:35----------
itself is not at all corroded and in

---------22:37----------
spite of the SMC not being corroded in

---------22:41----------
spite of the SMC being told to turn on

---------22:42----------
our pp bus is twelve point three volts

---------22:47----------
so now I'm gonna look over the board for

---------22:49----------
some hints and see if there's anything

---------22:50----------
around here that's gonna give me a clue

---------22:52----------
as to why this board is acting this way

---------22:55----------
so here we have corrosion and corrosion

---------22:58----------
is definitely something that I take

---------22:59----------
interest in when we have a liquid damage

---------23:01----------
board that's not working properly but

---------23:03----------
the reason I'm not taking the most

---------23:04----------
interest in this corrosion over here is

---------23:06----------
because this corrosion that you see ahem

---------23:09----------
stream deck really for a second lag

---------23:11----------
between changing scenes there we go

---------23:12----------
stream decks back I added some stuff to

---------23:15----------
the stream deck check this out check

---------23:16----------
this out no get the [ __ ] out of here

---------23:21----------
[ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of my store

---------23:30----------
[Music]

---------23:35----------
great now get the [ __ ] out of here

---------23:39----------
get the [ __ ] out of my store [ __ ] get

---------23:42----------
the [ __ ] out of my store [ __ ] get the

---------23:45----------
[ __ ] out of my store [ __ ] get the [ __ ]

---------23:48----------
out of my store [ __ ] that being said

---------23:51----------
let's take a look at the microscope and

---------23:52----------
see what everything looks like on this

---------23:54----------
board

---------24:09----------
so this is a this is not a circuit

---------24:11----------
that's really important to me actually

---------24:15----------
no this is important to me what am I

---------24:16----------
talking about

---------24:19----------
hmm

---------24:37----------
okay this is backlight that's really not

---------24:40----------
important but what's this this this just

---------24:42----------
strikes me as something familiar what

---------24:44----------
are you you 70 190

---------24:45----------
oh you create the power for are you 70

---------24:48----------
100 ship yeah so this thing creates the

---------24:50----------
voltage for use for our is L six two

---------24:52----------
five nine to work an ISO 65 nine isn't

---------24:56----------
it makes people but G three hot which is

---------24:57----------
currently low so let's just take a look

---------24:59----------
and see if what supposed to be coming

---------25:00----------
out of this is actually coming out of it

---------25:01----------
so nice to have the stream deck back

---------25:04----------
okay we got five volts there five volts

---------25:07----------
there so even though that circuit is

---------25:08----------
corroding essentially doing its job so

---------25:10----------
let's continue around here okay now what

---------25:12----------
do you guys see over here on the

---------25:13----------
keyboard connector so what's going on

---------25:17----------
here is that typically when you hold the

---------25:18----------
power button down it's going to reset

---------25:20----------
the SMC now in our situation I didn't

---------25:24----------
don't think that that's the problem

---------25:24----------
because the SMC reset signal was held

---------25:26----------
high however the pins that are shorted

---------25:29----------
over here on this connector are pins

---------25:31----------
that seem to be imperative so the pins

---------25:33----------
that look shorted to me are my tweezer

---------25:41----------
pins that seem shorted our pins four and

---------25:44----------
five four and five and six and seven

---------25:48----------
appear to have some goop in them so

---------25:51----------
let's take a look at what those pins are

---------25:52----------
for on the schematic in the board view

---------25:53----------
so for that's keyboard on/off l and 3.42

---------25:58----------
volts so it's that that's strange that

---------26:01----------
the on off L and then the keyboard keys

---------26:03----------
which is not a big deal but keyboard

---------26:05----------
on-off L if that if there's anything

---------26:06----------
going on there it's gonna I think the

---------26:07----------
power button is held down and when you

---------26:09----------
hold down the power button that resets

---------26:11----------
the SMC so let's take a look at what

---------26:12----------
happens when you clean up that connector

---------26:14----------
and see if that makes our board work

---------26:16----------
again just turn on the fume extractor

---------26:33----------
so I'm gonna clean up this board a

---------26:35----------
little bit

---------26:45----------
[Music]

---------26:50----------
love the Ransom videos keep it up thank

---------26:52----------
you very much I really appreciate that

---------26:54----------
world's worst soldering coming up right

---------26:56----------
here courtesy of only using a pall of

---------26:59----------
flux

---------27:08----------
[Music]

---------27:14----------
because all the solder on this connector

---------27:16----------
is kind of mixed in with corrosion and

---------27:17----------
other junk

---------27:24----------
we're gonna redo each pen

---------27:38----------
[Music]

---------27:45----------
[Music]

---------27:58----------
jeopardy music would be nice too in quiz

---------28:00----------
times you know what I can actually get

---------28:02----------
jeopardy music on the stream deck okay

---------28:06----------
so here's a question for all of you what

---------28:08----------
is what is the right amount of flux to

---------28:13----------
use when reflowing a connector

---------28:20----------
[Music]

---------28:26----------
hi-hi says check your discord dm's

---------28:28----------
I never check my discord DMS my discord

---------28:32----------
names are so full of crap if I sins

---------28:37----------
if I started reading now and didn't

---------28:38----------
accept new ones that would be reading

---------28:40----------
until the end of the year

---------28:41----------
[Music]

---------28:56----------
[Music]

---------29:01----------
hi you know them well I don't read my

---------29:03----------
disk or DMS and you know why I don't

---------29:06----------
read those DM say hi contact me here

---------29:10----------
Oh fine I'll read my disk or DM since

---------29:14----------
how I said to add this to the stream

---------29:19----------
deck disgusting

---------29:25----------
disgusting practice oh here we go

---------29:31----------
for the audio disgusting practice this

---------29:39----------
is getting kind of fun downloads

---------29:41----------
disgusting practice I'm never gonna get

---------30:07----------
any work done again what is customer

---------30:08----------
service for $100

---------30:24----------
[Music]

---------30:35----------
[Music]

---------30:46----------
[Music]

---------31:00----------
[Music]

---------31:31----------
so we've made our keyboard connector

---------31:34----------
here look very nice as you can see I

---------31:36----------
have high hopes for this keyboard

---------31:38----------
connector so what I'd like to do is plug

---------31:40----------
this in and see if we have any

---------31:41----------
difference in our results now let's plug

---------31:43----------
this in and see what the results are

---------31:45----------
okay as you can see reif redoing the

---------31:49----------
keyboard connector got us a light and

---------31:52----------
we're also going to see if that light

---------31:53----------
has translated into being a fan spin I

---------31:56----------
have a set of axiom m60 speakers in the

---------32:00----------
front now so I can actually play this

---------32:02----------
fairly nice volume and left people

---------32:06----------
really know that they need to get the

---------32:07----------
[ __ ] out of my store

---------32:10----------
okay so we have a light and the charger

---------32:13----------
and the fan is spinning so let's take a

---------32:16----------
look at what goes on when the when the

---------32:18----------
power button thinks it's turned down I'm

---------32:21----------
gonna go over what I think was going on

---------32:22----------
with this machine from beginning to end

---------32:25----------
and that's so the first thing that I

---------32:28----------
noticed was that we were not getting a

---------32:30----------
green light on the charger and the

---------32:31----------
circuitry that's going to allow us to

---------32:32----------
get a green light and the charger can be

---------32:34----------
seen if we follow along over to the

---------32:36----------
section of the machine where the the

---------32:39----------
charger comes in so this is where the

---------32:40----------
charge port plugs into the computer over

---------32:42----------
here and we see we have 20 volts we have

---------32:44----------
ground and we have adapter sense adapter

---------32:47----------
sense is a line that's going to be able

---------32:48----------
to speak to the system management

---------32:50----------
controller the system management

---------32:51----------
controller needs to speak with the

---------32:53----------
charger and here hi I'm a snowflake

---------32:56----------
Apple charger hi snowflake Apple charger

---------32:58----------
hi I'm ready to be turned on I will send

---------33:01----------
you 18 volts and so on and so forth so

---------33:02----------
they have that and I will let you turn

---------33:04----------
on the machine with the the power of my

---------33:06----------
snowflake II Apple overpriced goodness

---------33:09----------
now this over here is not gonna speak

---------33:12----------
directly to the SMC on that says one

---------33:14----------
wire line because if it does that's

---------33:16----------
potential to kill the SMC this is a 20

---------33:19----------
volt power line and this is a 3 volt

---------33:22----------
data line if somebody is drunk and

---------33:24----------
wasted in trying to plug their connector

---------33:26----------
and only like like you know they're

---------33:30----------
wasted they're high they're drunk and

---------33:32----------
they're trying to do some [ __ ] like that

---------33:33----------
what's going to happen is that the a 20

---------33:36----------
volt line from the charger is going to

---------33:38----------
go to the 3 volt line for the SMC and

---------33:40----------
the SMC is gonna go and that

---------33:44----------
is that that's gonna be bad the same way

---------33:47----------
same thing will happen Apple stock price

---------33:48----------
on my channel had some million

---------33:49----------
subscribers someday one can only dream

---------33:52----------
so that is something that we are looking

---------33:54----------
to avoid so to avoid that we put you

---------33:57----------
7,000 and as a buffer this says oh are

---------34:00----------
you a 3.3 volt adapter cents line go

---------34:02----------
right ahead

---------34:03----------
speak to my SMC owe you a 20 volt power

---------34:06----------
line fu you're blocked

---------34:08----------
you're not going to my SMC screw that

---------34:10----------
now this circuit was is what speaks to

---------34:14----------
the SMC now we made sure that we had pp

---------34:17----------
3 before to the power rail that's going

---------34:18----------
to allow this this trip to turn on and

---------34:20----------
send power to this one that was all

---------34:22----------
working as we expected our adapter sent

---------34:25----------
signal was 3 volts as expected and we

---------34:28----------
went over to our SMC area and the SMC

---------34:30----------
was not corroded the SMC area over here

---------34:33----------
had zero corrosion this was going to

---------34:36----------
speak to the charger now we also

---------34:37----------
interestingly enough we checked our SMC

---------34:40----------
reset signal and SMC reset l was

---------34:43----------
actually present which is strange

---------34:45----------
because the issue that we were getting

---------34:47----------
is that we were in again a green light

---------34:49----------
because the SMC wasn't turning on we

---------34:50----------
confirmed the fact that the SMC wasn't

---------34:52----------
turning on by checking the voltage and

---------34:54----------
another chip that is controlled by the

---------34:55----------
SMC so over here you can see this this

---------34:58----------
is a totally separate chip on the board

---------34:59----------
but this chip the u 7100 it creates a

---------35:02----------
signal voltage called PB bus g3 hot it

---------35:05----------
speaks to the SMC the SMC talks to it

---------35:07----------
and it tells it make me 12 point 56

---------35:10----------
volts but if the SMC is unable to talk

---------35:12----------
to it it's not gonna make it 12 point 56

---------35:14----------
volts this chip will only make twelve

---------35:16----------
point three it needs the SMC to say hey

---------35:17----------
bro I need more voltage than that and at

---------35:19----------
the SMC is not turning on this is not

---------35:21----------
gonna happen so the lack of green light

---------35:23----------
ant combined with the lack of twelve

---------35:25----------
point six volts being made by this chip

---------35:27----------
which it usually is making if the SMC is

---------35:29----------
talking to it led us to believe that the

---------35:30----------
SMC was not turning on the lack of

---------35:32----------
corrosion by the SMC led me to believe

---------35:34----------
that the SMC was not turning on not

---------35:36----------
because it was broken but rather there

---------35:38----------
was another external factor so what are

---------35:40----------
those other external factors over here

---------35:42----------
you can see SMC on/off l is a signal

---------35:45----------
that goes to our SMC reset ship

---------35:47----------
so this SMC reset chip is going to make

---------35:50----------
sure that SMC reset L is held low as in

---------35:53----------
SMC will be reset when the signal is low

---------35:56----------
like zero volts for about a quarter of a

---------35:58----------
second when the machine

---------35:58----------
first gets plugged in so that the the

---------36:01----------
SMC doesn't crash because we're gonna

---------36:03----------
keep the SMC from crashing when peepee

---------36:04----------
three before to power rail turns on with

---------36:06----------
the machine we're going to give it a

---------36:07----------
little second to stabilize that SMC

---------36:09----------
reset signal is there SMC on-off L can

---------36:12----------
control that signal it's one of the one

---------36:15----------
of the many ways of controlling that

---------36:16----------
signal or putting it into a reset mode

---------36:18----------
again now SMC on-off L it means hey I'm

---------36:22----------
hitting the power button turn the

---------36:23----------
machine on or off when I'm low and that

---------36:25----------
is controlled by something near the

---------36:27----------
keyboard so we have our we have our 4810

---------36:32----------
and that's gonna be a resistor between

---------36:34----------
the keyboard and SMC on/off L which

---------36:36----------
means that our keyboard it which is

---------36:38----------
where the power button is attached to

---------36:40----------
has the ability to control SMC reset so

---------36:43----------
not only does SMC on-off L not only does

---------36:46----------
this power button on the computer show

---------36:49----------
you the power button not only does my

---------36:51----------
power button turn they just turn the

---------36:53----------
computer on the power button also has

---------36:55----------
the capability to reset my SMC and the

---------36:58----------
SMC on/off L signal is going to be

---------37:01----------
present on pin 5 and if we take a look

---------37:05----------
at pin 5 that was the pin that was

---------37:08----------
corroded so we went over the board with

---------37:10----------
the proper amount of flux

---------37:11----------
none of that Paul ship maybe we made

---------37:13----------
sure we use the proper amount of flux

---------37:15----------
cuz we're not gonna get people on this

---------37:16----------
channel the idea that they gotta buy

---------37:18----------
less flux cuz you know that's when

---------37:19----------
that's where I mean nobody treats Paul s

---------37:22----------
not that [ __ ] and we used a proper

---------37:26----------
amount of flux to redo this connector so

---------37:28----------
I added solder to a bunch of the pins

---------37:31----------
I then wick to that solder away and then

---------37:33----------
I added solder again and then I kind of

---------37:35----------
cleaned it a little with the hot air I'm

---------37:37----------
gonna give it one more cleaning with the

---------37:38----------
hot air later then this is gonna go

---------37:40----------
through the ultrasonic cleaning we are

---------37:41----------
going to touch up any of these areas

---------37:43----------
even though the section of the board is

---------37:44----------
working and that's working we're gonna

---------37:46----------
touch that stuff up later to make sure

---------37:48----------
that it looks better because I could

---------37:49----------
leave the board like that but that's

---------37:50----------
kind of that's kind of mean and messed

---------37:52----------
up we want to make sure that this board

---------37:53----------
goes back to the customer in a condition

---------37:55----------
where it is actually going to last for a

---------37:57----------
long time I want all of my customers to

---------38:00----------
be happy I don't want there to just be a

---------38:02----------
large percentage of users I don't want a

---------38:06----------
small percentage of people to have

---------38:08----------
problems I don't want a small percentage

---------38:10----------
to have problems I want to be happy

---------38:12----------
and if you want to watch any of the

---------38:14----------
stuff in an environment where there are

---------38:16----------
less advertisements or a higher quality

---------38:18----------
then but please I urge you to check out

---------38:20----------
boards Rossmann group comm on boards

---------38:24----------
rossmann group com the videos are sorted

---------38:27----------
by the model of the board so you can go

---------38:29----------
through every single model board or you

---------38:31----------
can check by the problem that you have

---------38:34----------
with your board so you can scroll here

---------38:36----------
and you can see exon battery this rail

---------38:38----------
missing that rail missing no keyboard no

---------38:40----------
trackpad green light missing battery not

---------38:43----------
charging random kernel panics and when

---------38:45----------
you click on any one of these issues

---------38:48----------
it'll present you with a playlist that

---------38:51----------
shows you all of the videos that I've

---------38:52----------
made related to that issue and this is

---------38:55----------
in a YouTube free environment so not

---------38:57----------
only do you not have to deal with

---------38:58----------
pre-roll or post roll ads but you also

---------39:02----------
get to deal with a higher quality of

---------39:05----------
video since these videos are compressed

---------39:07----------
by Vimeo not by YouTube where it gives

---------39:10----------
you just a little bit of better power I

---------39:12----------
mean better quality and above all again

---------39:16----------
I I pay nine hundred seventy nine

---------39:18----------
dollars a year for my videos to be

---------39:20----------
hosted on Vimeo and there's no

---------39:22----------
monetization I get paid by YouTube for

---------39:25----------
my videos to be on YouTube with

---------39:27----------
monetization so I lose money when people

---------39:30----------
decide to view on Vimeo but I make money

---------39:32----------
when people decide to view on YouTube

---------39:33----------
and I am still suggesting that you stop

---------39:36----------
watching my videos on YouTube and start

---------39:37----------
watching the ones Emil should tell you

---------39:39----------
something about the amount of respect I

---------39:40----------
have for Google so that's that's one

---------39:43----------
board out of the queue and as always I

---------39:45----------
hope you learned something

---------39:46----------
thank you very much for watching and if

---------39:48----------
you like before it goes out of stock
