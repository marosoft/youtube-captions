---------00:00----------
okay today I'm gonna go over the a20

---------00:03----------
3115 board that had me backlight the

---------00:06----------
LVDS cable was visibly burned the fuse

---------00:09----------
was blown and there's no light on the

---------00:11----------
screen as a result of liquid damage I'm

---------00:13----------
gonna go through the troubleshooting

---------00:14----------
process so the first thing that you do

---------00:17----------
on a board that has no benefit before

---------00:19----------
anything else before replacing the fuse

---------00:21----------
because replacing the fuse can be a

---------00:22----------
complete waste of time if the

---------00:25----------
short is still there it's actually test

---------00:27----------
the circuit now what we start see is

---------00:31----------
means the morning is where the backlight

---------00:34----------
circuits started see I don't give a

---------00:36----------
if I flip the fan over because I know

---------00:38----------
every side of the connector and we start

---------00:40----------
right over here on this one so over here

---------00:43----------
is where the backlight ends so let's go

---------00:47----------
over here see that or it says PPV out at

---------00:52----------
SW LCD booklet you can find this crap on

---------00:55----------
Mac rumors there's a ton of people that

---------00:56----------
have uploaded these little pages and

---------00:58----------
schematics

---------01:00----------
- noise oh you can see right over there

---------01:03----------
that see nine seven nine nine see nine

---------01:06----------
seven nine seven and c---nine seven

---------01:09----------
ninety six and i'm the opposite side of

---------01:11----------
benign 701 our the backlight circuit all

---------01:14----------
terminate so that's right here yeah oh

---------01:18----------
you like to have the stuff open in a

---------01:19----------
split view so here's my other screen see

---------01:24----------
and it tells me that see nine seven nine

---------01:25----------
nine is right over here so actually the

---------01:30----------
wire attached to that I'll get to that

---------01:31----------
later but a quick way to test this

---------01:33----------
I try to get this all on views and said

---------01:35----------
oh no the tripod is using multi unit so

---------01:41----------
I put this in the diode mode you can

---------01:43----------
either do a resistance test phones or a

---------01:45----------
diode touch the die like a diode one

---------01:47----------
because it's a little quicker so you put

---------01:50----------
the positive to ground then you put this

---------01:52----------
over here and this is the measurement

---------01:53----------
that you should get so this is a diode

---------01:55----------
mode measurement what a multimeter diode

---------01:58----------
mode measurement does is it measures the

---------01:59----------
voltage drop across a diet now a diode

---------02:03----------
is kind of like a check valve employment

---------02:05----------
you know how they have those valves

---------02:06----------
where it'll only allow the water to flow

---------02:08----------
one way but it won't go the other way

---------02:10----------
well I'm just putting that inside the

---------02:12----------
pipe causes there to be some sort of

---------02:14----------
resistance because you put something

---------02:15----------
inside the pipe that was not there

---------02:17----------
before and the same is true for a diode

---------02:19----------
any diode that only allows electricity

---------02:21----------
to pass one way it'll allow it to pass

---------02:23----------
just fine but there's gonna be a very

---------02:24----------
small voltage drop where in the diode

---------02:27----------
because there's something in the diode

---------02:29----------
that's keeping electricity from being

---------02:30----------
able to flow back the other way and

---------02:32----------
usually that's about 0.5 so the reading

---------02:35----------
that you see here on my back light

---------02:37----------
circuit when I put the positive on

---------02:38----------
ground and the ground at the output of

---------02:42----------
the backlight circuit is 0.53 and that's

---------02:44----------
that's a proper measurement now if your

---------02:46----------
backlight circuit is so see one

---------02:47----------
of two things

---------02:48----------
I'm very rarely you'll see oh l which is

---------02:50----------
it means that there is no

---------02:54----------
it's not measuring any voltage drop and

---------02:57----------
sometimes you will see point one point

---------03:00----------
two which means there is a voltage drop

---------03:02----------
at a zoo but there's a very very small

---------03:07----------
voltage drop and that is also no good

---------03:10----------
most commonly you'll see something like

---------03:12----------
point one or point two which means that

---------03:14----------
somewhere in the back light circuit

---------03:16----------
there is a shorter ground and that's

---------03:17----------
what I have here so replacing the fuse

---------03:19----------
again if you're gonna replace a fuse in

---------03:21----------
the circuit is still shorted and you're

---------03:23----------
not getting a point four nine nine or

---------03:25----------
0.58 or 0.53 measuring it's completely

---------03:28----------
pointless again depending on your

---------03:29----------
multimeter and the leads and your test

---------03:32----------
environment you may not always get point

---------03:33----------
five three one you know again if you get

---------03:35----------
a point four nine nine whatever most of

---------03:38----------
the time there's just fine but there's

---------03:39----------
still a short you're

---------03:41----------
and here there was one and it was

---------03:43----------
driving me nuts so that's what I said

---------03:45----------
a wire is here for this is a piece of

---------03:47----------
Kent five cable it's in solid core it's

---------03:50----------
very thin so it's easy to work with but

---------03:52----------
it's also solid enough that it will

---------03:55----------
carry a high current so what I did is I

---------03:59----------
attached an attorney

---------04:00----------
so here is a g5 power supply you can get

---------04:05----------
a test bench power supply for like 150

---------04:07----------
or 200 bucks I use this because it is

---------04:09----------
pretty some douche left off this g5

---------04:13----------
tower here and never picked it up which

---------04:16----------
means that power supply is mine it was

---------04:18----------
one of those people than he was he

---------04:20----------
brought it in stinks from 2003 I

---------04:23----------
wish I knew you didn't work on this

---------04:25----------
before I came all the way down here from

---------04:27----------
inside like dude I don't care if you

---------04:33----------
came from Mars I don't work on

---------04:34----------
eleven-year-old computers that were out

---------04:36----------
when I was a freshman in high

---------04:37----------
school and if coming the East Village

---------04:40----------
all the way from a quarter-mile up in

---------04:42----------
the Upper East Side is that much of a

---------04:45----------
 inconvenience to you how about

---------04:46----------
you make a goddamn phone call to ask hey

---------04:49----------
do you work on antique horse and

---------04:51----------
then I would say no we don't work on

---------04:53----------
antique horse you could save

---------04:54----------
yourself the time anyway I don't know

---------04:57----------
what is actually wrong with this it just

---------04:58----------
turns on and has nothing on the screen

---------05:00----------
and my reception is kind of thought I

---------05:03----------
was being a little hard on her dude at

---------05:04----------
the time so I I said watch this we're

---------05:06----------
gonna call we're gonna say it'll be 90

---------05:08----------
bucks to fix your computer I don't even

---------05:09----------
know what's wrong with it I don't care

---------05:10----------
I'm doing this to prove a point because

---------05:12----------
I know he's not gonna say yes so he call

---------05:14----------
and say it'll be 90 bucks to fix he's

---------05:16----------
like you know like he had a

---------05:18----------
heart attack like I just slit the throat

---------05:20----------
of his first-born song prove the point

---------05:23----------
that it would be was completely

---------05:24----------
worthless to work on hold for

---------05:26----------
because people are simply not willing to

---------05:28----------
pay for it most the time and even if

---------05:30----------
they are you're never gonna find

---------05:31----------
for it anyway the power supply was

---------05:33----------
totally fine it's been more than

---------05:35----------
45 days and he hasn't picked it up so

---------05:38----------
this is now my managed power supply so

---------05:41----------
back to my point so I need to find out

---------05:44----------
where the shortest now as you can see on

---------05:45----------
my board here I have this big hunk and

---------05:47----------
wire coming out of it

---------05:49----------
and not giving a if I knock the

---------05:50----------
can I drop forth I have spares so this

---------05:55----------
is my wire now the point here is is a

---------05:58----------
short between the output of the

---------06:00----------
backlight and ground somewhere in the

---------06:02----------
circuit based on the measurement that I

---------06:03----------
got which at the time was not point five

---------06:06----------
three one was a point one there was a

---------06:08----------
short between the output of the

---------06:09----------
backlight and ground somewhere in this

---------06:11----------
circuit and you can test each component

---------06:14----------
individually but sometimes you can there

---------06:17----------
can be millions of little places they

---------06:18----------
just look at all the components always

---------06:19----------
below again if you're working with one

---------06:21----------
individual circuit or one individual

---------06:23----------
part you may be easy to find this short

---------06:25----------
but sometimes you really can't find it

---------06:28----------
anywhere and that's where I found myself

---------06:29----------
at this board which is why I thought

---------06:31----------
that's why on so here's the point of the

---------06:34----------
toy this output here is shorting to

---------06:36----------
ground so the output of the backlight

---------06:38----------
which is it's like 12 to 27 volts is

---------06:42----------
shorting to ground so I decided to be

---------06:44----------
with the board off it is put 27 has put

---------06:48----------
the 12 volts of this power supply like

---------06:50----------
so into the 12 volt to the backlight now

---------06:54----------
since that circuit is short on a ground

---------06:55----------
that means at the 12 volt power supply

---------06:57----------
is gonna show up ground so what I did is

---------07:00----------
I took a bunch of LED strips that work

---------07:03----------
off of 12 volts and I put the positive

---------07:05----------
of the LED strip on the grounds of the

---------07:07----------
board because I know that the 12 volts

---------07:09----------
my power supply is flowing to the

---------07:11----------
backlight circuit the backlight circuit

---------07:12----------
because it's is shorting a

---------07:14----------
graphic which means my 12 volts will

---------07:15----------
show up on the ground so I attach the

---------07:17----------
positive of the LED strips to here and

---------07:19----------
then I attach the ground of the LED

---------07:22----------
strips back to the ground of my power

---------07:24----------
supply which completes the circuit now

---------07:26----------
what this means is that in order to

---------07:28----------
power my LED strips the 12 volts has to

---------07:31----------
flow through whatever component in the

---------07:33----------
board is shorting the back life circuit

---------07:35----------
to brown

---------07:36----------
so after his shorting backlight circuit

---------07:38----------
to ground is going to be in for a world

---------07:41----------
a pain when it has to pump 10

---------07:43----------
amps through it to not power the lights

---------07:46----------
now what we usually happen in this

---------07:48----------
scenario is what every component on the

---------07:49----------
board is shorting my circuit to ground

---------07:53----------
is going to turn red it's gonna get

---------07:55----------
boiling high and the rare occasion you

---------07:58----------
may even just pop itself off the board

---------07:59----------
which is pretty cool now in this case it

---------08:03----------
did not do that by the way a note of

---------08:04----------
caution if you're trying to test the

---------08:06----------
three volt circuit obviously do not plug

---------08:08----------
it in 12 volts because you are

---------08:09----------
going to sodomize if you're testing five

---------08:11----------
volt circuit don't put 12 volts in

---------08:12----------
you're gonna sodomized it this is a

---------08:15----------
circuit that starts with 12 volts and

---------08:16----------
boosts it to 27 so I'm totally okay with

---------08:19----------
putting 12 volts into it because I know

---------08:21----------
that it's meant to handle anyway so I

---------08:24----------
put that in and I want to padding like

---------08:27----------
three LED strips which is 15 amps

---------08:29----------
nothing was even getting remote

---------08:31----------
and this was just starting to piss me

---------08:32----------
off now the short in this one who's

---------08:35----------
actually in the LCD connector so once I

---------08:39----------
removed this LCD connector it went away

---------08:41----------
and the up part is usually you

---------08:43----------
can see under a microscope if there's a

---------08:45----------
short usually you can if you put us this

---------08:47----------
there we go microscope over here you'll

---------08:49----------
see some stupid little pin a

---------08:51----------
piece of solder that burned and is now

---------08:54----------
bridging two pins together which is

---------08:55----------
causing the short in here I really did

---------08:58----------
not see it was not there I removed it

---------09:00----------
with the hakko and in the short run away

---------09:03----------
and I put anyone on it and I put a new

---------09:06----------
one on there and I got that five three

---------09:08----------
one reader so here's my soldered LVDS

---------09:10----------
connector as you can see I stopped it's

---------09:13----------
either in this thing it's

---------09:15----------
horseshit same thing it's got a close-up

---------09:18----------
view they really does suck

---------09:23----------
yeah actually up soldering one of

---------09:26----------
those pins but I don't care I looked at

---------09:28----------
the schematic and it's a good that pin

---------09:29----------
is not connected that's one of the most

---------09:32----------
beautiful feelings in the world we

---------09:34----------
up something and you realize the thing

---------09:35----------
you up completely doesn't matter

---------09:37----------
and it's on that pretty sturdy I can rip

---------09:39----------
at it and nothing's gonna move something

---------09:41----------
I'm happy enough anyway I put the new

---------09:44----------
albeit new connector on and I get my

---------09:46----------
point five through one measurement a

---------09:47----------
beautiful because after that point I had

---------09:49----------
to place the fuse the other driver and

---------09:51----------
drove myself next open for a short that

---------09:54----------
was actually in the canary that's why it

---------09:56----------
wasn't given huh you see a resistor or

---------09:59----------
transistor which is nothing but a

---------10:00----------
transforming resistor they do their job

---------10:03----------
by emitting the extra power going

---------10:07----------
through it as heat so naturally a

---------10:09----------
transistor or a resistor if your

---------10:11----------
skull-fucking it with power to power LED

---------10:14----------
lights is going to get really really

---------10:15----------
compact where as a big honkin piece of

---------10:17----------
metal it's not going to get hot I mean

---------10:19----------
this this is not going to get hot unless

---------10:21----------
you put you know 300 volts like hundreds

---------10:24----------
of AM story but at the you know this is

---------10:27----------
not gonna get hot with little

---------10:29----------
twelve volts at 10 amps they're going

---------10:31----------
home let's say a tiny little capacitor

---------10:33----------
is but this is not so that test was

---------10:35----------
completely useless but after replacing

---------10:39----------
that I turn it on so now I'm

---------10:42----------
just I know you know even because my

---------10:45----------
measurement is fine I get the twelve

---------10:48----------
volts across the fuse so now we move on

---------10:50----------
to the next part which is checking the

---------10:52----------
backlight a naval voltage on this

---------10:54----------
machine I don't go to stick together on

---------10:58----------
this machine find a pulp control this is

---------11:01----------
also right next to the LED driver there

---------11:04----------
is a voltage divider that tells you the

---------11:08----------
tells there's a voltage divider network

---------11:11----------
that tells this chip when to turn on so

---------11:14----------
you're gonna mention this in another

---------11:16----------
video you can look at the last back my

---------11:17----------
video I did to learn what the voltage

---------11:19----------
divider is or you can just google it and

---------11:21----------
look at a youtube video where they

---------11:22----------
explain it much nicer than me with cute

---------11:24----------
little animation isn't so these two

---------11:27----------
resistors here are part of the voltage

---------11:29----------
divider network and over here on the

---------11:30----------
left side of each you're supposed to see

---------11:32----------
this one you're supposed to see and

---------11:34----------
three volts and that's supposed to be

---------11:36----------
going to the backlight I see so it's

---------11:39----------
just good close-up of this on the screen

---------11:42----------
ya see backlight enable on 9 7 3 1 + r9

---------11:47----------
715 created and I measured there and

---------11:50----------
those resistors measure what they're

---------11:51----------
supposed to but they're still my

---------11:52----------
backlight so then I went to the left a

---------11:55----------
little to see where that comes from and

---------11:56----------
it says on the screen here that comes

---------11:58----------
from pp bus SW LCD books power / I like

---------12:04----------
to actually pronounce it the way it's

---------12:06----------
spelled on the screen it's just kind of

---------12:08----------
like my little entertainment while

---------12:09----------
torturing myself at 1 in the morning so

---------12:12----------
when I search for LCD the Clipper which

---------12:14----------
is what power is that little voltage

---------12:17----------
divider network that creates the 3 volts

---------12:19----------
I see that that's power this transistor

---------12:23----------
here now this transistor opens based on

---------12:27----------
the signal from this voltage divider

---------12:29----------
which opens based on LCD booked an able

---------12:33----------
and booked pulse riseth pole I didn't

---------12:37----------
even bother going to those ones I just

---------12:38----------
said let's check this transistor it

---------12:40----------
looked fine then it said q9 7s

---------12:43----------
so I looked for q9 707 on here and

---------12:47----------
that's this here you can't see it

---------12:52----------
because I'm not aiming at it

---------12:56----------
whoa there we go

---------12:59----------
so that's that

---------13:07----------
now you can see the missing little

---------13:09----------
residual flux because that pin in that

---------13:11----------
pin for some reason has some kind of

---------13:12----------
solder blob of corrosion as I'm sure the

---------13:14----------
perfection piss on and because of that

---------13:17----------
it was actually shorting those two pads

---------13:21----------
together and let's see what I'd actually

---------13:24----------
forget what those two pads are for so

---------13:26----------
let's look it up so I can tell you

---------13:37----------
there is a lot

---------13:45----------
yes so LCD backlight enable and LCD

---------13:49----------
backlight disabled so the gate was

---------13:52----------
actually shorting to the source of q9

---------13:55----------
707 which is why you didn't get me back

---------13:59----------
like voltage so once I fix that TP bus

---------14:06----------
SW book looks powered put out 12 volts

---------14:09----------
which allowed our 973 1 + r9 715 to

---------14:13----------
create 3 volts 12 volts in order to send

---------14:16----------
3 volts the backlight enable backlight I

---------14:19----------
see which told you to turn long and at

---------14:22----------
the end of that it actually worked which

---------14:25----------
is pretty cool
