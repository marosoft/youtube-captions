---------00:00----------
okay so today I'm gonna be going over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero 26:10 motherboard that's

---------00:04----------
not turning on we're going to start with

---------00:06----------
how we troubleshoot why we go through

---------00:09----------
the steps that we go through and what

---------00:11----------
leads us to our conclusion to how to fix

---------00:14----------
it and all of this is going to be done

---------00:16----------
in real time like with all of these

---------00:17----------
videos so this is a 2009 17 inch unibody

---------00:22----------
the reason I enjoy bringing this board

---------00:24----------
up is because often when I get trolled

---------00:26----------
saying it what by people who say Apple

---------00:28----------
products don't have problems for every

---------00:30----------
year you're making this stuff up and I

---------00:33----------
bring up the recalls very often they'll

---------00:34----------
say what about 2008 what about 2009

---------00:37----------
those are solid models right wrong and

---------00:41----------
you're going to see exactly why in this

---------00:43----------
video so this doesn't turn on and it has

---------00:46----------
no liquid damage so if I am to plug the

---------00:49----------
MagSafe in I get a nice light see I get

---------00:55----------
a light and when I short e power pads

---------00:59----------
here it doesn't turn on so in a no power

---------01:04----------
issue the first thing that I'm going to

---------01:06----------
want to do is check each one of my power

---------01:09----------
rails so what I do here is I open the

---------01:11----------
schematic and I'm going to go to a page

---------01:12----------
on the schematic that shows me this

---------01:14----------
stuff so let's just open up the open

---------01:16----------
broadcaster monitor on the other screen

---------01:18----------
so I can see what I'm showing you the

---------01:20----------
first thing that I'm going to check for

---------01:21----------
is pp bus g3 hot which is an always

---------01:24----------
present rail so I'm going to check pp

---------01:27----------
bus g3 hot over here and let's see if I

---------01:30----------
can set this up so that you can see the

---------01:32----------
multimeter along with the screen here we

---------01:34----------
go so I have my multimeter right here

---------01:36----------
you probably won't be able to see that

---------01:38----------
because it's too damn small but we're

---------01:40----------
gonna check pp bus g3 hot on the

---------01:42----------
sections that it says it's supposed to

---------01:43----------
show up now the schematic says it's

---------01:45----------
supposed to be 6 volts which i think is

---------01:47----------
wrong I think it's actually supposed to

---------01:48----------
be 8.4 on this one and it's 8.39 so I

---------01:51----------
ignore the schematic the schematic in

---------01:53----------
this case is wrong pp bus g3 hot is

---------01:55----------
supposed to be 8 point 4 volts on this

---------01:57----------
board I know that from testing working

---------01:59----------
boards so it's really important if you

---------02:01----------
want to do something like this for a

---------02:03----------
living that you have known working

---------02:05----------
devices so that when the schematic is

---------02:07----------
wrong or when you're confused about

---------02:09----------
something that the schematic says that

---------02:11----------
you can clarify that information

---------02:13----------
so what we're gonna do right now is move

---------02:15----------
on to the next voltage rail which is

---------02:16----------
this pp bus CPU I MVP blah blah blah we

---------02:21----------
are going to check to see if that exists

---------02:23----------
so we check to see if this exists not

---------02:26----------
found sometimes the stuff is named

---------02:28----------
differently in the schematic than it is

---------02:30----------
in the board view software which is a

---------02:32----------
complete pain in the ass alright so

---------02:34----------
we're gonna check on this side of the

---------02:35----------
board where it says that I'm supposed to

---------02:39----------
check I get eight point three nine now

---------02:47----------
we move on to the next one now P P 18 V

---------02:50----------
v DC n connection I know that I can

---------02:53----------
ignore that one and the reason I know I

---------02:54----------
can ignore that one is because

---------02:56----------
everything else in the machine wouldn't

---------02:57----------
work if the charger rail wasn't present

---------02:59----------
so P P 18 V v DC in connector I'm adding

---------03:04----------
some words in there so I'm just seeing

---------03:06----------
Kannan I'm assuming that means connector

---------03:09----------
this is coming in that was loud this is

---------03:12----------
coming in from the charging so this is

---------03:15----------
this is gonna be coming in from the

---------03:16----------
charger so I have no interest in

---------03:19----------
checking that if my other rails are

---------03:21----------
present if the charger rail wasn't

---------03:23----------
present P P bus g3 hot would not be

---------03:25----------
present therefore I can save time by

---------03:26----------
just not checking that power rail now

---------03:29----------
let's move on to the next one the next

---------03:31----------
one here is pp 3 V 4 to underscore g3

---------03:35----------
hot now I know that that rail is present

---------03:38----------
because that pret rail needs to be

---------03:39----------
present in order for the one wire

---------03:41----------
circuit to operate if you don't know

---------03:42----------
what the one wire circuit is I would

---------03:44----------
highly suggest that you check out my

---------03:45----------
other videos in this channel related to

---------03:47----------
the 1 wire circuit long story short the

---------03:49----------
1 wire circuit is what allows the

---------03:51----------
charger to talk to the system management

---------03:53----------
controller chip on the motherboard if

---------03:54----------
the charger cannot talk to the system

---------03:56----------
manager controller chip you won't get a

---------03:59----------
green light in the charger and because I

---------04:01----------
have a green light on the charger I know

---------04:03----------
that my SMC is on so I know that PP 3

---------04:07----------
before 2 must be present so what I can

---------04:08----------
do at this point is move on to the next

---------04:11----------
rail which is pp 5v s3 so I'm gonna

---------04:14----------
check and see where that rail is and

---------04:16----------
where I can measure it on the

---------04:18----------
motherboard let's see if I can measure

---------04:19----------
it here alright so I'm going to check

---------04:22----------
for it and where it says that I'm

---------04:26----------
supposed to

---------04:27----------
let's see where is that on this board

---------04:30----------
too big I should just check it on the

---------04:41----------
other side I never bother taking the

---------04:43----------
speaker off which makes it a little bit

---------04:44----------
more difficult that's a nice big place

---------04:48----------
to check for it is right here there we

---------04:50----------
go

---------04:53----------
this thing always knows which way it is

---------04:55----------
on the desk so that it can put it the

---------04:56----------
opposite way and we have zero point zero

---------05:01----------
zero zero volts now we're on to

---------05:03----------
something so now let's continue

---------05:04----------
following along this path and see if we

---------05:06----------
can understand what's going on so what

---------05:08----------
I'm gonna do at this point is I'm going

---------05:09----------
to see if PP 5 vs 3 is being told to

---------05:13----------
turn on now what I like to say what I've

---------05:15----------
been saying in this video series for a

---------05:17----------
while now is that I like to check the

---------05:19----------
beginning of a circuit and the end of a

---------05:21----------
circuit so that I avoid wasting time on

---------05:24----------
everything that's going on in between so

---------05:26----------
the way that I like to save time I

---------05:27----------
checked the end of the circuit meaning

---------05:29----------
PP 5 vs 3 is not there now instead of

---------05:32----------
going back to see what creates PP 5 es 3

---------05:34----------
and bla bla bla bla bla

---------05:35----------
I'm gonna go back to the enable signal

---------05:38----------
that tells it to turn on so let's go

---------05:40----------
over the PP 5 vs three circuit in the

---------05:42----------
schematic here

---------05:45----------
I'm just looking for where it shows up

---------05:47----------
it shows up everywhere but I want it I

---------05:49----------
want the page that actually creates it

---------05:51----------
and here we are

---------05:52----------
so let's fullscreen this so that you can

---------05:54----------
see it a little better and let's get my

---------05:56----------
ugly face out of the way ah that's more

---------05:59----------
of my ugly face in the way okay so we

---------06:02----------
are what see where was that here here

---------06:05----------
all right now this seems very very

---------06:07----------
confusing very confusing right let's try

---------06:10----------
to make this a little less confusing

---------06:11----------
what do you think here is going to turn

---------06:13----------
on or enable my chip hmmm maybe it's one

---------06:17----------
of those pads it says en4 enable you're

---------06:20----------
going to notice that a lot of what

---------06:21----------
you're doing here a lot of your job is

---------06:22----------
just when you're doing this type of

---------06:24----------
thing it's just adding vowels and

---------06:27----------
consonants on to words that are very

---------06:28----------
hyper abbreviated now where is pp 5 es 3

---------06:32----------
PP 5 es 3 it's here it says 5 volt 3.3

---------06:36----------
volt power supply and over here at the

---------06:37----------
end you can see PP 5 es 3 underscore reg

---------06:41----------
is the rail that is missing so it's

---------06:42----------
created by the left side now this is a

---------06:44----------
buck converter if you don't understand

---------06:46----------
what a buck converter is or how it works

---------06:48----------
again I have a video in the basic

---------06:50----------
electronics video series that tells you

---------06:52----------
exactly how a buck converter works what

---------06:54----------
it is I show you with pictures I

---------06:56----------
represent what's going on at every

---------06:58----------
single individual point if you don't

---------06:59----------
know what a buck converter is I would

---------07:01----------
suggest you pause this video at this

---------07:02----------
time and move on to the video where I

---------07:04----------
explain what a buck converter is if you

---------07:07----------
don't know what is enabling pp5 es3 when

---------07:10----------
you can do is you can take the name of

---------07:12----------
the chip which is included right over

---------07:13----------
here and I can google that and let's see

---------07:16----------
if we can get a datasheet for the chip

---------07:18----------
so here we go we're getting a datasheet

---------07:21----------
so now I'm not interested in most of

---------07:24----------
this what I'm interested in is the pin

---------07:25----------
out where it's going to tell me what

---------07:26----------
each individual pin does I don't care

---------07:28----------
about this whole operating temperature

---------07:30----------
and all of this engineering mumbo-jumbo

---------07:32----------
that's not for us

---------07:34----------
that's for designers I'm interested in

---------07:37----------
is this okay what pin does what what pin

---------07:40----------
does what there we go en 1 & en 2

---------07:47----------
channel 1 in channel 2 switched-mode

---------07:50----------
power supply enable pins because that is

---------07:53----------
what a buck converter is switched-mode

---------07:54----------
power supply when turning on apply

---------07:56----------
greater than 0.5 volts in less than 6

---------07:58----------
volts to connect to ground to disable so

---------08:03----------
en 1 and e n2

---------08:04----------
let's go back to my schematic over here

---------08:07----------
now on the right you see en 1 and that's

---------08:10----------
on the side of pp 3 B 3 on the left you

---------08:13----------
see Ian Noctor on the right you see en 2

---------08:17----------
which is on the side of pp 3 B 3 on the

---------08:20----------
left you see en 1 which is on the side 4

---------08:23----------
PP 5v which enable do you think is the

---------08:26----------
one that we're looking for do you think

---------08:28----------
this is channel 1 or do you think this

---------08:29----------
is channel 1 I'm pretty sure that the

---------08:31----------
left side is channel 1 because the left

---------08:33----------
enable is on the left side which is

---------08:36----------
where PP 5 es 3 is so en 1 is probably

---------08:38----------
what I'm looking for so let's follow

---------08:40----------
this line a little bit and see where

---------08:43----------
this is coming from

---------08:44----------
now unfortunately during 2008 and a

---------08:47----------
little bit of early 2009 the schematics

---------08:49----------
were written by people who are you know

---------08:52----------
kind of high on marijuana so you can

---------08:54----------
see that they decided instead of drawing

---------08:56----------
a line that they just decided to draw a

---------08:58----------
box this is some kind of you know hippie

---------09:01----------
existentialist movement you know like

---------09:03----------
yeah man why is a signal gotta like go

---------09:07----------
to places man like why can't it just

---------09:10----------
circle around and become one with itself

---------09:12----------
now I know this is [ __ ] confusing I'm

---------09:15----------
sorry on behalf of whatever hippy Apple

---------09:17----------
engineer was roasted the day that they

---------09:19----------
decided to do this but here see where it

---------09:22----------
says in this is the signal that is going

---------09:25----------
to enable one I know it's hard to

---------09:26----------
[ __ ] tell but and the other

---------09:27----------
schematics it's not because they didn't

---------09:29----------
have crackheads doing it that day p5 vs

---------09:32----------
3e n remember what I said to save time I

---------09:35----------
don't check the every single thing along

---------09:38----------
the way I checked the front of the

---------09:40----------
circuit and the back of the circuit so

---------09:42----------
I've already checked over here I don't

---------09:44----------
have 5 volts I'm not going to check this

---------09:46----------
now I want to see where this [ __ ] comes

---------09:47----------
from because I don't want to waste my

---------09:49----------
time on everything in between I'm not

---------09:51----------
gonna taste my time checking that I'm

---------09:54----------
not gonna waste my time checking this

---------09:55----------
resistor let's see now I'm gonna try to

---------09:58----------
figure out where this ends so p.m. sleep

---------10:00----------
s 4 L is going to create that through

---------10:02----------
this resistor I'm not even gonna check

---------10:03----------
that resistor yet I'm not gonna check

---------10:05----------
this signal I'm going to check where

---------10:07----------
this begins we've checked the end I'll

---------10:10----------
lower the volume [ __ ] sake so p.m. sleep

---------10:14----------
s4l that comes from mCP 79 which is the

---------10:19----------
big chip in the center of the

---------10:20----------
motherboard which must mean that that

---------10:22----------
chip is dead right I need to reball it I

---------10:25----------
need to replace it I need to reflow it

---------10:28----------
with a heat gun like they tell me on all

---------10:30----------
these dumbass websites because that chip

---------10:32----------
on this board is also the GPU and all

---------10:34----------
these people they put towels on it and

---------10:36----------
they fixed it with towels or with heat

---------10:38----------
guns because that's the or ovens and

---------10:39----------
reflow ovens and this is where you guys

---------10:42----------
you've got to stop that [ __ ] because

---------10:45----------
you're giving our industry a reputation

---------10:47----------
as people who don't have a brain who

---------10:49----------
can't think and it's it's just very very

---------10:53----------
bad the way I actually wound up figuring

---------10:55----------
out what's really wrong with this board

---------10:56----------
is I was actually I thought it was a

---------10:59----------
bios issue because the BIOS controls the

---------11:01----------
mCP 79 or in this case for the SPI ROM

---------11:04----------
so I would replace BIOS

---------11:07----------
and it would work but then it would stop

---------11:09----------
working you want to work and then would

---------11:10----------
stop working and the BIOS is right over

---------11:13----------
here the problem with this board is

---------11:15----------
right over here so what I was actually

---------11:16----------
doing is I was heating the section that

---------11:18----------
is heating around the section with the

---------11:20----------
problem and the component that was dead

---------11:22----------
would come back to life for a second and

---------11:24----------
I'm gonna show you how he figured out

---------11:25----------
what component that is so MC P 79 is not

---------11:28----------
putting out a signal that it's supposed

---------11:29----------
to put out so let's see something here

---------11:31----------
so instead of assuming that the mCP is

---------11:33----------
dead how about we check and see if the

---------11:35----------
mCP actually has power to turn on so

---------11:38----------
we're gonna go back to that page that

---------11:39----------
lists all the power rails inside the

---------11:41----------
machine and let's see what here is

---------11:43----------
probably going to the mCP so where we

---------11:46----------
are we're not making it to an S 5 s3

---------11:49----------
state we're not making it to an s3 State

---------11:50----------
so I'm not gonna check the s oh where

---------11:52----------
else I know they're not there because

---------11:52----------
we're not even in s3 I'm not gonna check

---------11:55----------
this at the moment not this at the

---------11:57----------
moment so we go down the list of rails

---------11:58----------
down the list of rails and we're gonna

---------12:04----------
get to one that is interesting because

---------12:07----------
it's one that's responsible for the mCP

---------12:10----------
to be working P P 1 vo 5 s 5 MC P right

---------12:15----------
this rail this thing right here

---------12:27----------
this is also a buck converter so let's

---------12:30----------
see what we have here so this is gonna

---------12:31----------
be one point zero five volts that goes

---------12:34----------
to the mCP and we can check that right

---------12:38----------
over here around this coil el seven

---------12:41----------
seven seven zero now let's see what

---------12:43----------
happens on the multimeter voltage mode

---------12:47----------
we get this back on zero point three one

---------12:55----------
five volts now that doesn't seem like

---------12:58----------
one point zero five volts to me now if

---------13:02----------
you take a look at that area let's think

---------13:04----------
about this logically let's think about

---------13:06----------
what is likely to go wrong when there's

---------13:08----------
no liquid damage on the board when

---------13:10----------
there's no / signs of overheating

---------13:12----------
because keep in mind this is a machine

---------13:13----------
that actually runs pretty cool the

---------13:15----------
graphics card that comes with it is not

---------13:17----------
the way too powerful way to a hot for

---------13:20----------
the cooling system that Apple is used to

---------13:21----------
putting in these machines it's something

---------13:23----------
that's actually appropriate so what in

---------13:25----------
this area is going to go bad for no

---------13:28----------
apparent reason or what component has

---------13:30----------
the reputation for going bad for no

---------13:33----------
apparent reason so if I switch over to

---------13:34----------
the microscope camera and you look

---------13:36----------
around you can see there's no real

---------13:38----------
liquid damage there's no physical damage

---------13:40----------
there's no damage in terms of something

---------13:43----------
exploding or a shock or over voltage or

---------13:46----------
anything like that there's no evidence

---------13:48----------
of any of that but we do have a

---------13:49----------
capacitor over here and here's where I

---------13:51----------
want to get it now I'm gonna get into

---------13:54----------
what what Apple did wrong so they ran

---------13:56----------
out of space over here they ran out of

---------13:58----------
space and what you may notice is that

---------14:00----------
these over here these 330 micro farad

---------14:04----------
capacitors are large whereas this one is

---------14:07----------
tiny not only is this one tiny but it's

---------14:10----------
also really really expensive and that is

---------14:14----------
that is an issue so it increases the

---------14:15----------
cost of the board and it also it doesn't

---------14:18----------
last as long now one thing I want you to

---------14:20----------
understand is that this is an s5 rail so

---------14:22----------
this being an s5 rail means that it's

---------14:24----------
going to be on all the time so that

---------14:27----------
little cap is going to be working all

---------14:29----------
the time if the computers plugged in

---------14:31----------
it'll be working if the computers not

---------14:33----------
plugged in but the battery is there it

---------14:35----------
will be working even if the battery is

---------14:37----------
too low to provide power for the

---------14:39----------
computer to turn on that

---------14:41----------
we'll still be working so what's OPP

---------14:43----------
buzz g3 had instead of being 8.4 volts

---------14:45----------
because the battery is dead it's at 8

---------14:47----------
volts or 7.9 two-bit that buck converter

---------14:50----------
is still gonna be working it may not be

---------14:52----------
making 1.0 5 volts may be making one

---------14:54----------
point zero four zero three but still

---------14:56----------
that thing is working all the time so

---------14:59----------
for something that's gonna be working in

---------15:00----------
on all the time you're gonna want to use

---------15:02----------
a component that is going to be able to

---------15:04----------
stand up to that level of abuse not one

---------15:07----------
single little tantalum capacitor that is

---------15:10----------
too small for the job at hand that has

---------15:12----------
that that doesn't have anything in

---------15:14----------
parallel to help it out and that's the

---------15:17----------
problem that we encounter here and this

---------15:19----------
is why a lot of the 2008 and 2009

---------15:21----------
unibody boards die a random death just

---------15:25----------
just out of nowhere again no water no

---------15:27----------
drop no no over voltage no knockoff

---------15:30----------
charger it just dies and for all of you

---------15:33----------
saying that there was no recall in 2008

---------15:35----------
and 2009

---------15:36----------
you are right Apple didn't have a recall

---------15:39----------
for unibody Zin that year in unlike

---------15:41----------
again they had the 2007 and 8 pre

---------15:45----------
unibody recall they at the 2010 graphics

---------15:47----------
recall 2011 graphics recall 2012

---------15:50----------
graphics recall recently the Mac Pro

---------15:53----------
2013 graphics recall but this [ __ ]

---------15:55----------
should have been a recall this should

---------15:58----------
have been an extended warranty now you I

---------15:59----------
know what you're thinking you may be

---------16:00----------
looking at me and saying Louis it's 2016

---------16:03----------
of course [ __ ] from 2008 is gonna be

---------16:05----------
[ __ ] dim the thing is this [ __ ] was

---------16:07----------
dying in 2010 the [ __ ] was dying in 2011

---------16:10----------
this was dying in 2012-2013 it's been

---------16:12----------
dying for a very long time and Apple

---------16:15----------
managed to weasel their way out of

---------16:16----------
supporting their customers here and if

---------16:18----------
you look at let's say C 95 60 on the 8 -

---------16:23----------
0 - 28 50 board you may get a some bit

---------16:27----------
of understanding as to why that board

---------16:30----------
has graphics chip issues tell me if

---------16:32----------
anything looks similar to you tell me if

---------16:35----------
anything looks familiar to you from what

---------16:37----------
you see on this board a lot of people on

---------16:40----------
forums have been driving themselves

---------16:42----------
crazy trying to figure this out I know

---------16:44----------
you know duco from from Netherlands was

---------16:47----------
one of them who just thought you know

---------16:48----------
you thought that these boards were all

---------16:49----------
trashed for a very long period of time

---------16:51----------
and he's very good at pattern

---------16:53----------
recognition he's amazing at pattern

---------16:54----------
ignition he's great at just general

---------16:56----------
basic logic and common sense and good at

---------16:58----------
like distilling the stuff down into

---------16:59----------
common sense and then one day he looks

---------17:01----------
at this board at that cap and then he

---------17:04----------
looks at the 2850 board and he sees that

---------17:06----------
cap and he thinks to himself wait a

---------17:09----------
second and bada-bing the 2850 boards are

---------17:14----------
no longer useless crap you know pretty

---------17:17----------
cool stuff I actually hope to be opening

---------17:20----------
a question and answer forum soon where

---------17:22----------
you're gonna have access to people like

---------17:24----------
that who will be able to answer these

---------17:25----------
questions to a high standard of quality

---------17:27----------
for you and I'm you know that's

---------17:29----------
something that I'm excited about

---------17:31----------
hopefully that goes well so back to what

---------17:33----------
we were doing so the proper thing to do

---------17:34----------
here is to put a non tantalum capacitor

---------17:36----------
there so that this [ __ ] will actually

---------17:38----------
work and that's going to be the fun part

---------17:40----------
because we have to do a little bit of

---------17:41----------
moving around because the non tantalum

---------17:43----------
capacitor is going to be considerably

---------17:46----------
larger in size so fitting it into that

---------17:48----------
space is going to be a bit of a mess but

---------17:51----------
so a little bit of relocating you know

---------17:54----------
nothing crazy just a bit of Rila you

---------17:57----------
know it's been a mood just a bit of

---------17:58----------
housecleaning so let's see what we have

---------18:02----------
to do here first things first this these

---------18:07----------
are large components on a multi-layer

---------18:09----------
PCB so I got to turn the temperature up

---------18:11----------
a little bit here

---------18:22----------
Apple by the way never solved that

---------18:24----------
problem when they would fix those boards

---------18:27----------
they were still kernel panicking so a

---------18:29----------
lot of people will say you know

---------18:30----------
authorized repair is the only way to go

---------18:33----------
when Apple failed to figure out what was

---------18:35----------
wrong with those boards some random dude

---------18:38----------
who fixes the stuff out of his home did

---------18:43----------
just something to be thinking about if

---------18:45----------
you're one of those trolls who always

---------18:47----------
talks about a authorized repair can't

---------18:49----------
figure [ __ ] out again an unauthorized

---------18:51----------
person who does this like as a hobby out

---------18:55----------
of his house managed to figure out [ __ ]

---------18:58----------
that Apple's entire engineering

---------19:00----------
department looked over just something to

---------19:03----------
think about here okay now we're gonna

---------19:09----------
make some room made a little bit of room

---------19:12----------
there and now we're gonna remove this

---------19:13----------
capacitor

---------19:23----------
okay we take that out of the way let's

---------19:27----------
get rid of some of that old led a

---------19:29----------
lead-free solder first thing I'm gonna

---------19:31----------
do here let's add some leaded to make it

---------19:36----------
easier to get rid of my iron doesn't

---------19:40----------
want to get hot it's a lazy Sunday lazy

---------19:48----------
Sunday here at work one thing I love

---------19:53----------
about this JBC is I can actually turn it

---------19:55----------
off when I'm done and turn it back on

---------19:56----------
I don't like with the with the I like

---------19:58----------
the hakko and I like the WH a 900 but

---------20:01----------
the thing is it takes so long for that

---------20:02----------
[ __ ] to heat up that you turn it on when

---------20:04----------
you start your workday and you turn it

---------20:07----------
off when you're done with your workday

---------20:08----------
like that that's really the way that

---------20:11----------
works some you can't if you actually

---------20:13----------
expect that you can turn that thing off

---------20:15----------
and then turn it back on and have a

---------20:17----------
productive work day it's impossible

---------20:18----------
because I like the well or WH a 900 but

---------20:21----------
the amount of time it takes to get the

---------20:22----------
temperature is just absolutely

---------20:24----------
ridiculous I mean maybe if you're

---------20:26----------
working on stuff that that doesn't

---------20:28----------
really that doesn't require a high

---------20:32----------
temperature it's good but if you're

---------20:33----------
working on stuff like this you know

---------20:35----------
again you're gonna notice that thing

---------20:36----------
takes forever I got a little bit of dust

---------20:38----------
on the board along with the flux I guess

---------20:41----------
I'll have to live with it I also scraped

---------20:42----------
very hard and you may think that's a bad

---------20:44----------
thing that I shouldn't have done again

---------20:46----------
but you'll see like again what I'm gonna

---------20:48----------
be doing to this board to make it work

---------20:50----------
is so ridiculous that what I did right

---------20:55----------
here is really of no consequence in the

---------20:58----------
greater scheme of things usually you

---------21:00----------
actually are scraping in order to fit

---------21:02----------
the larger capacitor in I'm doing my

---------21:04----------
best to not heat up that dust and crap

---------21:06----------
because I don't want it to get inside my

---------21:07----------
solder joint get out of here so now what

---------21:11----------
I'm going to do is is fine myself for

---------21:15----------
330 microfarad capacitor that is not

---------21:19----------
made of tantalum that I'm gonna put in

---------21:21----------
that space and once I do that this will

---------21:25----------
be set and working as soon as I find the

---------21:30----------
board that actually has one left let's

---------21:33----------
see

---------21:35----------
oh I have one left in the spool

---------21:37----------
beautiful I have one left in the spool

---------21:40----------
and there's no need for theft

---------21:51----------
I went through an entire spool of this

---------21:53----------
already

---------22:16----------
this is so ghetto let's see which way

---------22:22----------
would this be better suited

---------22:46----------
yeah some [ __ ] like this let's move it

---------22:50----------
out of the way of that coil yeah I know

---------22:53----------
what you're thinking unprofessional

---------22:55----------
you know it's unprofessional designing a

---------22:58----------
board that's made to die so don't don't

---------23:01----------
give me that [ __ ]

---------23:09----------
Apple gave me enough room on the circuit

---------23:11----------
board I would be more than happy to fix

---------23:13----------
this quote-unquote

---------23:14----------
properly but they didn't what do you

---------23:17----------
want from me seriously

---------23:19----------
you want me to put another tantalum one

---------23:21----------
on there that's gonna die in a month I

---------23:25----------
often talk about reputation in this

---------23:27----------
industry and you know in doing things

---------23:30----------
that are gonna last and doing things

---------23:32----------
that you can actually feel good about

---------23:33----------
you know I want the [ __ ] that I do has

---------23:36----------
to actually work that's the last and I

---------23:42----------
talked about decreased consumer

---------23:43----------
confidence in repair because you have a

---------23:45----------
lot of idiots that go around you know

---------23:47----------
doing stupid [ __ ]

---------23:49----------
it's like reflowing graphics chips and

---------23:52----------
blood giving it back to people with

---------23:56----------
30-day warrantee and it dying and you

---------23:58----------
know that's gonna make people less

---------24:00----------
likely to fix stuff I'm not gonna I'm

---------24:03----------
not gonna put a tantalum one there just

---------24:04----------
cuz it looks nice it's gonna die

---------24:14----------
yeah I can actually get a better fit if

---------24:16----------
I just it's the first thing to do here

---------24:19----------
at us

---------24:31----------
I mean the technical I mean if you

---------24:33----------
really wanted to get into the

---------24:34----------
professionalism of what I'm doing

---------24:36----------
technically yeah this is probably less

---------24:38----------
less structurally sound in terms of if

---------24:41----------
you dropped it from the top of a

---------24:43----------
building like would it still work kind

---------24:45----------
of thing because you I'm you you know

---------24:47----------
the component is too big for the pads

---------24:49----------
and over here I have the component a

---------24:51----------
coil it's soldered so let's say half of

---------24:53----------
the pad so you're right there but at the

---------24:55----------
same time you know it's compromised like

---------24:58----------
what's if somebody drops this off of the

---------25:01----------
top of a building it's going to be dead

---------25:02----------
anyway so it might have you know might

---------25:05----------
as well have it so that for the people

---------25:07----------
who don't decide to drop it off the top

---------25:08----------
of a building it will actually work

---------25:11----------
right so first things first here we're

---------25:17----------
gonna put that coil back on but first I

---------25:22----------
want to make sure that that could pass

---------25:23----------
the capacitor to solder ball growing on

---------25:25----------
the side of it that I wasn't fond of the

---------25:27----------
reason I'm redoing that is because what

---------25:29----------
i'm doing here is like with the what was

---------25:35----------
i saying

---------25:44----------
because there was a solder ball right on

---------25:46----------
the side of the capacitor that I

---------25:47----------
couldn't get to but also again if I'm

---------25:48----------
gonna have the if I'm going to have the

---------25:51----------
the coil soldered to half of the pads at

---------25:54----------
the very least it would be nice if I

---------25:57----------
could do that with you know some fresh

---------26:01----------
solder joint instead of a seven-year-old

---------26:03----------
solder joint that I just semi refloat

---------26:06----------
with no flux

---------27:07----------
I could definitely move that over a

---------27:09----------
little bit

---------27:42----------
okay now that that is done now I'm just

---------27:45----------
gonna move the capacitor up a tiny bit

---------27:49----------
get it right where I want it

---------28:02----------
so there you have it nicely

---------28:09----------
yeah nice crooked board everything that

---------28:13----------
I do is crooked so I mean they've in

---------28:15----------
terms of you know aligning stuff fits

---------28:17----------
it's almost kind of like my warranty

---------28:19----------
sticker at this point so I'm okay with

---------28:21----------
that

---------28:25----------
okay we swing this back into place if

---------28:29----------
you're thinking of getting the

---------28:29----------
articulating stand do realize that it

---------28:31----------
moves around constantly when you have

---------28:33----------
here if somebody's walking down the room

---------28:36----------
down the hall you're gonna have it shake

---------28:38----------
all the time the articulating boom stand

---------28:40----------
drives me nuts so what I do is I have

---------28:41----------
the non articulating one but I just keep

---------28:44----------
the knobs semi loose and I can just

---------28:45----------
swing it to the side and push it out of

---------28:47----------
my way I strongly recommend not getting

---------28:49----------
the articulating boom because it'll

---------28:50----------
drive you nuts

---------28:51----------
watching Mark Schaefer try to do long

---------28:54----------
screw at practical board repair school

---------28:56----------
with that articulating microscope is the

---------28:58----------
funniest [ __ ] okay so let's see what I

---------29:02----------
get now on the multimeter so I'm going

---------29:03----------
to move it back to voltage mode I had it

---------29:05----------
in in ohms just so that I could see that

---------29:08----------
is there were three there were three

---------29:11----------
pads on that capacitor I just wanted to

---------29:13----------
see which ones were same so I wouldn't

---------29:17----------
short my circuit to ground one point one

---------29:20----------
zero one it's not one point zero five

---------29:23----------
but it's definitely closer to one point

---------29:24----------
zero five then 0.316 --is alright so now

---------29:30----------
if I short the power pads on that same

---------29:33----------
board what do you know the fan spins

---------29:37----------
which as I like the joke on this channel

---------29:40----------
means that I'm done totally done so yeah

---------29:45----------
that's that and I hope you learned

---------29:47----------
something you can join the forum that's

---------29:50----------
going to be in the link in a description

---------29:51----------
it's going to be a $30 a month

---------29:53----------
membership if you would like to be able

---------29:55----------
to ask questions on this stuff and get

---------29:57----------
answers from people with equal or more

---------29:59----------
knowledge than myself

---------30:00----------
we also teach an in-person tutoring

---------30:03----------
class at the store where we go over this

---------30:05----------
stuff one-on-one so if you want to learn

---------30:07----------
more about motherboard repair and you're

---------30:10----------
not really getting what you need to get

---------30:11----------
out of the videos you can come here I'm

---------30:13----------
gonna have a link to that as well and if

---------30:15----------
you don't want to spend

---------30:16----------
a dime you would rather die than see me

---------30:19----------
get like a nickel of your money then you

---------30:21----------
can watch these videos which are

---------30:23----------
completely free I have over a hundred

---------30:25----------
videos and instructional content on

---------30:27----------
component-level motherboard repair and

---------30:28----------
it's all free so that you can learn how

---------30:30----------
to do this stuff and hope you learned

---------30:33----------
something
