---------00:00----------
that's it today we're going to start on

---------00:01----------
an eight to zero 33 30 it turns on

---------00:04----------
perfectly on the battery but it gives

---------00:05----------
you a no green light in the charger

---------00:09----------
common issue one wire a circuit problem

---------00:11----------
as I've explained before so one of the

---------00:13----------
things we're gonna do before we start

---------00:15----------
doing anything else is let's see what

---------00:17----------
kind of voltage gives me on PP brushed

---------00:19----------
III hot not that it matters but I'm just

---------00:21----------
curious

---------00:25----------
so it gives me absolutely nothing 170

---------00:29----------
millivolts which is worthless for our

---------00:32----------
intensive purposes so now let's open the

---------00:37----------
schematic the board view for the a20 33

---------00:40----------
30

---------00:42----------
and look for that lovely one wire

---------00:44----------
circuit that I talked about so often

---------00:50----------
so if you don't know what a data line is

---------00:53----------
look for the data line video this is a

---------00:56----------
data line between the charger where you

---------00:58----------
see adapter sense and they misspelled

---------01:01----------
adapter on the schematic and the SMC

---------01:07----------
which is that's this one wire so if you

---------01:09----------
follow us this one wire you'll see that

---------01:12----------
that goes to you 4900 which is as you'll

---------01:16----------
see over here the SMC so over here this

---------01:23----------
is gonna be a data line so this is chip

---------01:25----------
over here see it as a couple of paths

---------01:27----------
you have ground and c4 not connected you

---------01:30----------
have internal which is the system side

---------01:32----------
of the data line the SMC external which

---------01:35----------
is the outside portion of the data line

---------01:37----------
which is the charger and then you have

---------01:40----------
VCC VCC is power to turn this chip on

---------01:43----------
that power over here is also attached to

---------01:45----------
this resistor the pull-up resistor for

---------01:47----------
the data line so if this chip over here

---------01:49----------
this logic gate does not let 3.42 volts

---------01:51----------
through this is a logic gate this chip

---------01:54----------
over here is gonna take PP 3 V 4 2 and

---------01:56----------
it's going to send it to power this chip

---------01:58----------
and it's also going to send it over here

---------02:00----------
to create the data line along which the

---------02:03----------
charger is going to talk to the SMC it's

---------02:06----------
not gonna happen without sm c bc AC ok

---------02:08----------
being pressed so I'm going to make a few

---------02:10----------
measurements on my board over here and

---------02:12----------
again the way I find out where this crap

---------02:14----------
is using this board view software

---------02:19----------
you're going to ask me what I get

---------02:20----------
from even though the answer is obvious

---------02:23----------
in every video so just just to

---------02:28----------
get that that point across for all you

---------02:29----------
people are gonna ask me where the stuff

---------02:31----------
comes from because I know that you will

---------02:32----------
ask me where it comes from let me show

---------02:35----------
you so this is not a good example of the

---------02:38----------
schematic because this is one of the

---------02:39----------
very very few schematics where it

---------02:41----------
doesn't actually show you it but since I

---------02:43----------
know you're going to ask let me just

---------02:45----------
find find one where I know it has it in

---------02:48----------
there

---------02:53----------
hmmm I wonder where Louis gets

---------02:56----------
schematics from hmm I wonder where Louis

---------02:58----------
gets a schematics from hmm I wonder

---------03:01----------
where he gets this stuff from where do

---------03:04----------
you get them from

---------03:05----------
use your brain it's written

---------03:07----------
right there it's written in large 72

---------03:11----------
size font in 1080p resolution and let me

---------03:14----------
tell you something that you know I don't

---------03:15----------
answer those questions because if you

---------03:17----------
can't Google like like the model of your

---------03:20----------
board and the word schematic you I just

---------03:22----------
know you have no chance of ever ever

---------03:24----------
ever figuring this out you are never

---------03:26----------
gonna troubleshoot a system that has

---------03:27----------
5000 little components on it that you

---------03:29----------
can't see and figure out how they work

---------03:31----------
if you don't know how to use Google but

---------03:33----------
even if you can't use Google right in

---------03:36----------
there so just stop asking but back to

---------03:41----------
the point so what I'm gonna do over here

---------03:43----------
is I'm gonna measure at different parts

---------03:45----------
in the circuit and we're gonna try to

---------03:46----------
troubleshoot and see what's going on so

---------03:48----------
first thing I want to see is is 3.42

---------03:52----------
volts making it to this chip so I take

---------03:54----------
my low so let's go probe you may wonder

---------03:57----------
why I use an oscilloscope to measure for

---------03:58----------
voltage it's to make life quicker so I

---------04:00----------
keep my multimeter in resistance or

---------04:02----------
diode mode and then I use this for

---------04:04----------
voltage first let's see if that's there

---------04:09----------
it isn't now we're going to check for

---------04:13----------
hmm just make sure this didn't stop

---------04:16----------
recording great

---------04:19----------
let's check if it's coming out of here

---------04:23----------
no let's check a pp3 view for two is on

---------04:27----------
that logic eight

---------04:29----------
is so there's peepee 3v4 - on u6 901

---------04:32----------
which is over here let's make that

---------04:34----------
bigger you can't see a damn thing right

---------04:37----------
now

---------04:40----------
oh my PDF reader doesn't want me to zoom

---------04:42----------
anymore

---------04:45----------
I know a lot of you say that I should

---------04:47----------
use Foxit and I'm probably really dumb

---------04:49----------
for not figuring out how to do this but

---------04:50----------
when I opened it the icons in the top

---------04:52----------
were much bigger and they waste a lot of

---------04:53----------
space and I spent about 40 seconds

---------04:57----------
trying to figure out how to get rid of

---------04:58----------
them and now is honestly the maximum

---------05:01----------
amount of time that I was willing to

---------05:02----------
spend because see how this annoyed me

---------05:03----------
with Adobe that annoyance took me like

---------05:05----------
three seconds and I solved it or five

---------05:07----------
seconds whereas Foxit I spent 40 seconds

---------05:09----------
trying to figure that out which is like

---------05:11----------
this annoyance times 11 or 12 13 and

---------05:14----------
that's now if Fox it needs to make a way

---------05:18----------
for me to in less than three seconds

---------05:20----------
figure out how to remove all those huge

---------05:22----------
icons that waste space in the top and

---------05:23----------
then I will use foxy but until it is so

---------05:26----------
obvious that I can do it in 10 seconds

---------05:28----------
or less I'm not interested anyway back

---------05:31----------
to the point so over here we are going

---------05:33----------
to be looking to see if we have s/m CBC

---------05:38----------
AC okay which is going to be over there

---------05:41----------
so let's try measuring that and when I

---------05:43----------
measure that

---------05:48----------
it's not there hmm where it is SM CBC AC

---------05:52----------
okay come from so that's the signal I

---------05:54----------
need open this logic a so this I can't

---------05:57----------
say that this is not working because

---------05:58----------
it's not getting power it's not getting

---------06:00----------
power because this is not sending power

---------06:02----------
and it's not because this chip doesn't

---------06:03----------
have power it's not because this logic

---------06:05----------
gate doesn't work it's because the logic

---------06:07----------
gate is not being told to turn on so see

---------06:09----------
how the troubleshooting one I ruled out

---------06:10----------
this chip I ruled out this chip I ruled

---------06:13----------
out this power line not being present

---------06:15----------
now we're gonna check and see when smc

---------06:17----------
BCE is he ok does so that goes into the

---------06:21----------
SMC and see now here here's what this

---------06:27----------
means see how it says this that that's

---------06:28----------
kind of like a little up way of

---------06:30----------
saying equals so SMC bc AC okay equals

---------06:33----------
charger AC okay after this point so

---------06:35----------
we're going to search for charger AC

---------06:36----------
okay that goes and over here

---------06:41----------
that's not really gonna pull it anything

---------06:44----------
down the you 7,000 over there

---------06:51----------
hmmm this is the chip related to

---------06:53----------
charging my computer is not charging

---------06:57----------
maybe I'm getting warm

---------06:59----------
and that's it so let's look at the use

---------07:04----------
of a thousand area

---------07:10----------
I need to clean this lens I don't know

---------07:14----------
if those are scratches or just dirt I've

---------07:16----------
tried cleaning it a few times and some

---------07:17----------
of it goes away but a lot of it does

---------07:23----------
now let's see if we have some basics

---------07:25----------
here another thing I forgot I actually

---------07:28----------
forgot to check for

---------07:32----------
charger ACN so this here does it's a

---------07:35----------
voltage divider from the charger so this

---------07:38----------
from adapter from adapter goes to this

---------07:42----------
de volta CH divider which is going to

---------07:43----------
turn the 18 volts of the charger into 4

---------07:45----------
volts for this AC and pin so let's see

---------07:47----------
if at charger AC in I have 4 volts

---------07:51----------
Finnegan you may wonder how do I know

---------07:53----------
that 4 volts is supposed to be there I

---------07:55----------
did the calculation and also it says

---------07:59----------
over here charger AC in so in my brain

---------08:03----------
that's does this chip see that the

---------08:05----------
charger has been plugged in that's like

---------08:07----------
a little indicator over there and if you

---------08:09----------
go to a website a voltage divider

---------08:10----------
calculator so there one of these voltage

---------08:13----------
one of these resistors is 30 kilo ohms

---------08:15----------
the other is 9.3 kilohms so again let's

---------08:18----------
just Google voltage divider calculator

---------08:21----------
because I sure as hell am NOT an

---------08:22----------
engineer that could figure that out on

---------08:24----------
my own we'll click the first result on

---------08:26----------
Google input voltage I know the charger

---------08:28----------
is 18.5 because it listed in the

---------08:30----------
schematic if you can't find it in the

---------08:31----------
schematic you can always measure

---------08:32----------
resistor 1 I've already forgotten so

---------08:35----------
we're gonna click thirty point one and

---------08:37----------
nine point thirty one thirty point one

---------08:39----------
and then 9.30 one that's gonna be in

---------08:43----------
kilohms which means that's in thousand

---------08:46----------
homes so that's nine point so that's

---------08:50----------
going to be this remember K ohms is

---------08:53----------
thousand ohms whereas this over here is

---------08:55----------
just ohms

---------08:57----------
and we compute and we should see four

---------09:00----------
point three volts there give or take

---------09:01----------
maybe I know maybe up to ten percent or

---------09:03----------
so and now let's see where charger AC it

---------09:09----------
is charger AC is going to be present

---------09:11----------
right here

---------09:13----------
oh so we measure and let's see what we

---------09:16----------
get

---------09:18----------
you

---------09:20----------
four volts that 99.9999% of the time

---------09:26----------
that's not the problem

---------09:27----------
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna

---------09:28----------
try replacing use 7000 and see if that

---------09:31----------
fixes my problem because you 7000 is

---------09:34----------
partially responsible for that whole

---------09:36----------
charger AC ok smc BCE AC ok thing and

---------09:41----------
maybe responsible for it now yeah I

---------09:45----------
really gotta clean this lens that's

---------09:48----------
that's embarrassing

---------10:07----------
as r700 to know stuff it is yeah so I

---------10:14----------
noticed the resistor was not there and I

---------10:16----------
just wanted to make sure was no stuff on

---------10:18----------
the schematic a resistor or a capacitor

---------10:19----------
or a diode is called no stuff when they

---------10:22----------
put it there on the schematic but it

---------10:24----------
doesn't actually ever show up in the

---------10:26----------
computer have any use it's just like no

---------10:28----------
they just they just decide to throw that

---------10:31----------
in there to waste some ink

---------10:58----------
this new heating element is such a piece

---------11:00----------
of not even close to melting

---------11:07----------
anything

---------11:24----------
if I turn the heat up anymore the thing

---------11:25----------
will just instantly turn off I feel like

---------11:36----------
I'm just slow roasting things like

---------11:38----------
people with iOS stations are I would

---------11:42----------
usually pull off at this point because

---------11:43----------
I'd be confident in the heat but I'm not

---------11:45----------
confident in the heat of this thing at

---------11:47----------
all l think it's actually kind of I'm

---------11:55----------
blaming the hakko and okay that was

---------12:02----------
really sad I just turned the air all the

---------12:06----------
way up to this piece of crap doesn't

---------12:07----------
have an excuse to turn off so the hakko

---------12:10----------
FR 801 sometimes the heat if the heat is

---------12:12----------
too high and the air is too low it'll

---------12:15----------
turn itself off but it said it were like

---------12:17----------
a ridiculous level I mean you have to

---------12:18----------
have the thing blowing really really

---------12:20----------
hard you know

---------12:28----------
you know like Kim Kardashian and her

---------12:32----------
earlier works kind of hard in order for

---------12:38----------
it to not turn off

---------13:09----------
so I used to be able to turn this if I

---------13:12----------
had it above six and a half and the air

---------13:15----------
below 1000 would turn off now if I have

---------13:17----------
the air below 20 and not hair the heat

---------13:20----------
above 6 the just turns itself off

---------13:23----------
it's so annoying

---------13:45----------
a lot of people keep asking what the goo

---------13:46----------
is that's flux that helps make solder

---------13:48----------
flow so every time you're heating solder

---------13:51----------
your move yours and you see the smoke

---------13:53----------
come out that smoke is actually the flux

---------13:55----------
if you have sided with flux inside the

---------13:58----------
flux will run away and when you have no

---------14:00----------
more flux the solder just becomes kind

---------14:02----------
of like a dry booger and it doesn't

---------14:04----------
actually really flow anymore

---------14:07----------
so that's Ametek 5:59 and I have it in a

---------14:10----------
little syringe there spools syringe

---------14:13----------
whatever you want to call I want to see

---------14:32----------
that they all have good contact I don't

---------14:33----------
really want to see like a separate I

---------14:35----------
don't want to see a separate pad on the

---------14:39----------
chip and a separate pad on the board I

---------14:40----------
just kind of want to see that that what

---------14:43----------
do you see right now like it's really

---------14:45----------
easy to start of this chicken properly I

---------14:47----------
actually did a last video I didn't how

---------14:50----------
to solder this chip I actually saw him

---------14:51----------
properly and you know cuz they have I'm

---------14:56----------
insane I decided to upload it anyway

---------14:58----------
that you could all see how to not solder

---------15:01----------
it in properly anyway let's see forget

---------15:07----------
anything now any any changes any

---------15:09----------
differences any okay as you can see that

---------15:18----------
was it so my my SMC bc AC okay or in my

---------15:27----------
charger AC okay signals were missing

---------15:30----------
because of a faulty is l6 259 that was

---------15:35----------
not so again so this is one of the cool

---------15:37----------
things about this system you know there

---------15:38----------
are a lot of things that I say about

---------15:40----------
Apple motherboards that are that are bad

---------15:43----------
but that's a pretty cool way this works

---------15:44----------
so you know that this chip takes the

---------15:48----------
charging voltage and turns it into 12

---------15:51----------
volts for the machine if that signal is

---------15:53----------
not present it will not allow the

---------15:56----------
charger to talk to the SMC you

---------15:58----------
in the one wire line therefore the

---------16:00----------
charger will not turn on so if there's a

---------16:02----------
fault with that circuit and it's a

---------16:03----------
serious fault serious enough that this

---------16:05----------
chip is not what is malfunctioning and

---------16:07----------
not working it just turns off the

---------16:08----------
charger which is a pretty cool pretty

---------16:10----------
cool safety feature there and yeah

---------16:12----------
that's it for today
