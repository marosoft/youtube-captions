---------00:00----------
one sec i gotta call paul over

---------00:03----------
you want to see if the board that i

---------00:04----------
shoveled through boots hey everybody

---------00:06----------
how's it going friends family enemies

---------00:10----------
and sometimes they're all just one and

---------00:11----------
the same so today

---------00:13----------
we're gonna be working on a macbook we

---------00:16----------
have here

---------00:17----------
is an a1989 macbook it does not appear

---------00:20----------
to be turning on

---------00:22----------
first thing we're going to do before we

---------00:23----------
get to work on this macbook is remove

---------00:26----------
the coronavirus from it

---------00:27----------
this machine has been sent to us by a

---------00:29----------
data recovery company

---------00:31----------
and it says on the ticket please check

---------00:34----------
rush availability

---------00:35----------
sticker from the customer

---------00:38----------
that's how you know you're getting rush

---------00:40----------
service when you send your macbook to a

---------00:42----------
company

---------00:42----------
that's going to mail it across the

---------00:44----------
united states to me

---------00:46----------
the customer was working and saw smoke

---------00:47----------
coming from the keyboard and the laptop

---------00:49----------
turned off

---------00:50----------
she said never had any liquid damage

---------00:53----------
please let me know if this can be

---------00:55----------
rushable well one way to find out

---------01:00----------
so you tried to use the computer and it

---------01:02----------
started smoking

---------01:03----------
sounds like a mac to me it's the normal

---------01:06----------
day

---------01:06----------
using an apple product let's open this

---------01:09----------
thing up and see if we can figure out

---------01:10----------
why it decided to randomly smoke

---------01:13----------
besides the fact that it is after all an

---------01:16----------
apple product

---------01:19----------
all right so let's see if there's any

---------01:21----------
hints here so

---------01:22----------
take a look here i don't see anything

---------01:24----------
here that looks like it smoked

---------01:26----------
so we're just going to do what we always

---------01:28----------
do here which is

---------01:30----------
first thing we do is see how many amps

---------01:32----------
it's taking on a usbc amp meter with a

---------01:34----------
battery unplugged now remember if the

---------01:35----------
battery is plugged in

---------01:37----------
then ppbush g3 hot is going to be

---------01:39----------
charging the battery so we're not going

---------01:40----------
to be getting the reading of how much

---------01:41----------
amperage the actual board is taking

---------01:44----------
we're going to be seeing the amperage of

---------01:46----------
the board plus the battery which removes

---------01:47----------
the diagnostic purpose in cape

---------01:49----------
that i get from plugging this in and

---------01:52----------
measuring the amperage that the board is

---------01:53----------
taking

---------01:59----------
all right so

---------02:02----------
okay what does a little chinese amp

---------02:04----------
meter say

---------02:08----------
hello rockford

---------02:11----------
okay we're stuck at 5 volts and 15

---------02:14----------
milliamps

---------02:16----------
which usually means dead t2

---------02:19----------
no oh son of a [ __ ]

---------02:22----------
all right let's see if that's what it is

---------02:28----------
yes two ends someone who gets it all

---------02:31----------
right so let's see what my peepee bush

---------02:32----------
g3 hunt voltage is it

---------02:34----------
okay so let's get paul daniels of

---------02:35----------
software on the screen

---------02:37----------
always a good day when paul daniels of

---------02:39----------
software is on the screen

---------02:41----------
and we have one ohm to ground on pp bus

---------02:42----------
g3 huh so just to give you an idea of

---------02:44----------
what i measured and why

---------02:46----------
let's open up a schematic for this board

---------02:48----------
this is the 820 820-0850

---------02:53----------
and i'm going to open this up and paul

---------02:56----------
daniels is amazing software which you

---------02:57----------
can check out at pldaniels.com

---------03:00----------
if you use if you use code rossman while

---------03:02----------
checking out he'll send you the bug-free

---------03:03----------
version

---------03:04----------
instead of the [ __ ] version he always

---------03:06----------
sends me i didn't say that did i

---------03:08----------
oh [ __ ] we're streaming so this

---------03:11----------
is going to have a list of power rails

---------03:15----------
somewhere let's get the list of power

---------03:17----------
rails up on the screen

---------03:19----------
here we go so over here we've got a nice

---------03:20----------
list of power rails and the first one is

---------03:21----------
ppg3 huh remember

---------03:23----------
g3 hot rails show up first they're

---------03:25----------
always on s5

---------03:26----------
rails the rom when the computer is off

---------03:28----------
s4 rails that are on when it's

---------03:29----------
hibernating meaning that it's saved

---------03:31----------
everything to the disk

---------03:32----------
and if you hit a button on your keyboard

---------03:33----------
or your trackpad it'll turn it back on

---------03:34----------
meaning that power to the keyboard and

---------03:36----------
trackpad have to be on

---------03:37----------
s3 sleeping meaning that it suspends

---------03:39----------
everything to ram when you hit sleep in

---------03:41----------
your computer you close the laptop and

---------03:42----------
it

---------03:43----------
remembers where all your programs are

---------03:44----------
because it saved the terrain which has

---------03:45----------
to be powered which means the s3 rails

---------03:47----------
have to be on

---------03:47----------
and so that's the top state which is

---------03:50----------
what my computer is in now while

---------03:51----------
actually streaming

---------03:52----------
so the first rail on that list was pp

---------03:54----------
bus g3 hot

---------03:56----------
and in paul daniels is amazing software

---------03:57----------
which you could find at pldaniels.com

---------04:00----------
when you right click it'll show you

---------04:01----------
everywhere in the board that it shows up

---------04:03----------
so i checked it out right over there

---------04:04----------
peepee bush d3 huh

---------04:06----------
do this do this do this

---------04:10----------
one ohm to ground which means it's a

---------04:12----------
short circuit something's to be blown up

---------04:13----------
so let's get the board out of the case

---------04:14----------
and see if we can figure out what short

---------04:16----------
circuited and make this macbook work

---------04:17----------
again

---------04:19----------
in order to take this macbook out of the

---------04:21----------
case we're going to have to take out a

---------04:22----------
bunch of screws which are all different

---------04:24----------
in size and shape

---------04:26----------
just to make it maximally confusing to

---------04:28----------
put the board back in the case when

---------04:30----------
you're done

---------04:31----------
because apple

---------04:40----------
okay this is almost out of the computer

---------04:49----------
now also you may have noticed that the

---------04:51----------
it's stuck at five volts when i plug the

---------04:52----------
charger and it's not going to 20 volts

---------04:54----------
so you may wonder if it's not going to

---------04:55----------
20 volts why am i even touching the

---------04:57----------
ppbus g3 hot chart before i solve that

---------04:59----------
problem

---------05:00----------
well on a board with no corrosion it not

---------05:02----------
going to 20 volts is going to be

---------05:03----------
something that's

---------05:04----------
likely unsolvable so i what i'm doing

---------05:06----------
here is procrastination

---------05:08----------
i'm going to procrastinate putting off

---------05:09----------
that of solving that problem that i'm

---------05:11----------
not able to solve

---------05:12----------
and i'm going to solve the problem that

---------05:13----------
i can solve because once i solve the

---------05:15----------
problem that i can solve

---------05:16----------
i'll get a nice happy little dopamine

---------05:18----------
kick my brain will uh

---------05:20----------
chemical will send out a chemical that

---------05:22----------
will make me feel like i'm smarter

---------05:24----------
than i actually am and then it'll make

---------05:27----------
me more effective

---------05:28----------
happier all that stuff and then i'll be

---------05:30----------
more likely to be able to solve the

---------05:31----------
other problem

---------05:32----------
so let's see how that goes all right so

---------05:36----------
let's take a look at what this looks

---------05:38----------
like under the microscope

---------05:40----------
shall we so let's take a look around the

---------05:43----------
board

---------05:43----------
and i think we found our peepee bus

---------05:45----------
short

---------05:46----------
holy crap wow one of the things you got

---------05:50----------
to keep in mind here with this with this

---------05:52----------
apple product

---------05:53----------
is that there's no liquid damage do you

---------05:55----------
see liquid over here do you see any

---------05:56----------
liquid damage does anybody here see

---------05:58----------
liquid

---------06:00----------
there's no liquid this is just straight

---------06:03----------
up

---------06:03----------
apple right here look at that

---------06:06----------
no liquid damage none

---------06:10----------
that cap just decided you know i'm done

---------06:12----------
being inside of a macbook [ __ ] that

---------06:14----------
i'm good we're out

---------06:32----------
so

---------06:35----------
so first thing to do here

---------06:38----------
put some hot air

---------06:48----------
so we're just going to blow some hot air

---------06:50----------
on this using my special tool

---------06:52----------
i call mine the de blasio

---------06:55----------
de blasio blows lots of hot air anytime

---------06:58----------
you push the button

---------07:00----------
feel free to name your hot air station

---------07:02----------
after your favorite politician

---------07:06----------
electro boom calls his odd air station

---------07:08----------
the trump

---------07:10----------
that's another popular one

---------07:13----------
no flux oh no we're going raw here

---------07:17----------
uh does the mask help with solar fumes

---------07:21----------
i don't know i don't think so

---------07:24----------
that's what i have this uh fume

---------07:26----------
extractor for

---------07:30----------
wow this is welded on the board here

---------07:33----------
all right that's not going to come off

---------07:34----------
with heat that's not yeah so i use this

---------07:37----------
this

---------07:37----------
see this over here this is a fume

---------07:39----------
extractor

---------07:42----------
and you should have something like this

---------07:43----------
if you're soldering if you don't have a

---------07:45----------
fume extractor this is a hakko fa-430

---------07:54----------
you sh you should at least like do

---------07:56----------
something like solder next to a window

---------07:58----------
or something

---------07:59----------
like you know i prefer this thing myself

---------08:03----------
yeah i use this if you're working at a

---------08:06----------
place without a few if you know it's one

---------08:08----------
thing if you're working in your home

---------08:09----------
fine you know don't spend that much

---------08:10----------
money open up a window

---------08:12----------
buy a 12 window fan or something and

---------08:15----------
just have it

---------08:16----------
blow the air out the window and you're

---------08:17----------
good if you're working at a job

---------08:20----------
and your boss does not want to buy one

---------08:21----------
of these quit

---------08:23----------
or tell them to go [ __ ] himself because

---------08:24----------
that means your your health and your

---------08:26----------
lungs and your well-being is not worth a

---------08:28----------
couple of bucks

---------08:29----------
so every every station here has one of

---------08:32----------
these

---------08:33----------
i don't so it doesn't really do much

---------08:35----------
because the solder fumes don't get to me

---------08:37----------
anyway

---------08:37----------
now it does get to me is the smell of

---------08:40----------
that that

---------08:40----------
garbage capacitor

---------08:48----------
so this cap i'm going to have to try and

---------08:50----------
break off kind of like a

---------08:51----------
what i'm going to do here is kind of

---------08:53----------
treat it like a paper clip if you want

---------08:54----------
to you know break it just back and forth

---------08:56----------
back and forth

---------08:57----------
now i also have to beg this begs the

---------09:00----------
question is this board even remotely

---------09:01----------
reusable like will this

---------09:03----------
is this crater too deep for it to ever

---------09:05----------
turn on again if i don't solder

---------09:06----------
constantly is a fan in a well ventilated

---------09:09----------
area fine i would dare say just fan out

---------09:12----------
the window

---------09:13----------
like fan away from you really fast or

---------09:16----------
what i used to do in the very beginning

---------09:17----------
when i was soldering by myself and i

---------09:18----------
didn't have a fan

---------09:19----------
i used to do this solder hold breath i

---------09:22----------
used to do this

---------09:27----------
solder cold breath

---------09:31----------
but you know that was a long time ago

---------09:34----------
that was a long time ago we're past

---------09:36----------
those days

---------09:38----------
i hope we're past those days now this is

---------09:39----------
just gonna be a little bit of cutting

---------09:41----------
and carving

---------09:43----------
pretend it's the thanksgiving turkey

---------09:52----------
pretend it's the person on the adorama

---------09:53----------
website that says that things are in

---------09:55----------
stock when they're not

---------09:57----------
and just carve it now and

---------10:01----------
the thing is some of this could be

---------10:02----------
ground and some of this could be the

---------10:03----------
power rail so i want to cut away

---------10:05----------
any of the ambiguous stuff without

---------10:07----------
cutting away what could be

---------10:08----------
signaling and i'm really hoping that

---------10:10----------
there's not signaling that's

---------10:12----------
gotten destroyed in these traces over

---------10:13----------
here but there is a chance that there

---------10:16----------
is signaling that is that that could

---------10:19----------
have been

---------10:20----------
screwed up here like see all these

---------10:21----------
little points see that see those little

---------10:24----------
uh circles over there circle circle

---------10:27----------
circle

---------10:28----------
all of that could be data lines

---------10:32----------
or signaling and because we're very

---------10:35----------
close to the cpu

---------10:36----------
and i don't want the 12 volts that's at

---------10:39----------
this supposed to be at this capacitor

---------10:40----------
anywhere near that but i also don't want

---------10:41----------
to cut them either so this is

---------10:47----------
so i kind of want to cut off the excess

---------10:49----------
at each point but without actually

---------10:50----------
cutting away that stuff

---------10:52----------
because i don't have anything that says

---------10:54----------
how the

---------10:55----------
the board is like how the board is put

---------10:58----------
together with regards to what each of

---------11:00----------
those

---------11:01----------
are the boardview software only tells

---------11:03----------
you what everything is on the first

---------11:05----------
layer

---------11:05----------
so if you take a look at the boardview

---------11:06----------
software i can only see what's on

---------11:09----------
what all these different little signals

---------11:10----------
are and where they go on the first layer

---------11:12----------
but i can't see that for

---------11:14----------
layers down under that's something that

---------11:15----------
requires i don't know

---------11:17----------
banging an engineer that works at apple

---------11:19----------
or something

---------11:22----------
you never know

---------11:26----------
can't rule it out well i guess for now

---------11:31----------
but you know once i can get back in the

---------11:32----------
gym

---------11:37----------
get my gains back

---------11:52----------
this is indeed a thing different moment

---------11:54----------
cuddly

---------11:55----------
all right

---------11:59----------
so we still got quite a bit to cut away

---------12:01----------
here

---------12:09----------
and yeah so this does have to get fixed

---------12:11----------
in order for you to get

---------12:12----------
uh get data off of it the

---------12:16----------
the actual data is encrypted by the t2

---------12:19----------
chip

---------12:19----------
to this specific board so if i don't get

---------12:22----------
this specific board working again this

---------12:24----------
person's date is gone

---------12:25----------
all because this board decided to commit

---------12:27----------
seppuku

---------12:29----------
that cap just thought to itself i would

---------12:31----------
rather set myself on fire like a little

---------12:33----------
[ __ ] terrorist

---------12:34----------
i would rather light myself on fire

---------12:37----------
didn't exist inside of a macbook anymore

---------12:40----------
just yelled some [ __ ] like doused itself

---------12:43----------
in gasoline and off it went

---------12:46----------
all right let's see if i got rid of my

---------12:50----------
short

---------12:58----------
huh yeah

---------13:03----------
i'm not doing that smart enough there's

---------13:06----------
not

---------13:08----------
you can't pay me enough actually you

---------13:10----------
could pay me enough but they're not

---------13:11----------
going to want to pay me enough

---------13:14----------
they're under filled as well no

---------13:24----------
okay okay

---------13:27----------
so there's still more to peel you know

---------13:29----------
what i i like a challenge i take a

---------13:32----------
challenge

---------13:39----------
i'll take a challenge we need to cut a

---------13:42----------
little bit more

---------13:46----------
fine

---------14:00----------
so

---------14:02----------
anywhere where i see two layers are

---------14:03----------
touching and i see exposed metal

---------14:06----------
that's where i'm trying to scrape it

---------14:08----------
away

---------14:12----------
get the [ __ ] out of there let paul do

---------14:16----------
what someone said you know what that's

---------14:17----------
really tempting

---------14:19----------
that's really tempting

---------14:24----------
let's see still shorted

---------14:30----------
oh oh oh never mind

---------14:33----------
wait maybe maybe 170

---------14:37----------
260 300 yes

---------14:40----------
oh short almost gone all right let's

---------14:42----------
keep going

---------14:44----------
see some success

---------14:47----------
all right kim

---------14:53----------
[Music]

---------14:55----------
let's keep digging

---------15:06----------
i feel like i'm taking the board's pants

---------15:08----------
off

---------15:11----------
doesn't this kind of look like a sexual

---------15:13----------
organ of some sort

---------15:15----------
i mean like you know from an electronics

---------15:17----------
point of view but

---------15:19----------
look at that it's kind of

---------15:22----------
weird isn't it

---------15:38----------
so

---------16:06----------
you're weird for saying that oh

---------16:16----------
here we go 2000 2400 ohms

---------16:19----------
28 for those who are not electronic

---------16:23----------
savvy

---------16:24----------
we're looking for the number to go up we

---------16:25----------
don't want resistance to ground so we

---------16:27----------
started at one

---------16:28----------
we went up to 100 something now we're up

---------16:30----------
to 10 000.

---------16:34----------
if this turns on i will be so impressed

---------16:37----------
but i doubt it will i think the reason

---------16:38----------
it's stuck at 5 volts

---------16:40----------
is because there's other stuff that goes

---------16:41----------
through there that's not all right so we

---------16:43----------
got 5 volts

---------16:44----------
255 milliamps

---------16:50----------
20 volts 50 milliamps wait 20 volt 60

---------16:54----------
come on use more than 50 milliamps come

---------16:56----------
on boot boot your piece of [ __ ] boot

---------16:59----------
oh 200 milliamps

---------17:02----------
all right this is probably booting holy

---------17:04----------
[ __ ] i gotta see if this is a picture

---------17:08----------
one sec i gotta call paul over you wanna

---------17:11----------
see if the board that i shoveled through

---------17:12----------
boots

---------17:13----------
hey you have to see this

---------17:20----------
it went down about through four layers

---------17:28----------
i'm excited to see if this has an image

---------17:30----------
oh god oh god i know

---------17:32----------
so it had one ohm then 50 ohm then 100

---------17:35----------
ohm then 2000 ohm now it's

---------17:37----------
up to 10 000 so i think i'm okay to boot

---------17:38----------
what's on that resistor

---------17:40----------
probably nothing important the resistor

---------17:44----------
is

---------17:46----------
a five volt g3 [ __ ] to cpu reg

---------17:49----------
yeah pp i don't know what g3 s means you

---------17:51----------
know what the s because it used to be

---------17:53----------
g3h

---------17:53----------
i don't know for hot i'm assuming s is

---------17:56----------
for [ __ ] g3 [ __ ]

---------17:57----------
g3 sustained

---------18:01----------
i'm excited because it's it's going to

---------18:03----------
20 volts and it's taking 200 milliamps

---------18:07----------
oh who needs it let's see i'm excited

---------18:11----------
you think it'll boot a picture an apple

---------18:14----------
logo

---------18:15----------
it all depends on that volt signal this

---------18:17----------
got sent in by a data recovery company

---------18:19----------
with rates over two thousand bucks

---------18:21----------
starting you know how much they're

---------18:23----------
probably going to charge their customer

---------18:24----------
for this

---------18:26----------
makes me sick anyway

---------18:29----------
let's see what we got

---------18:35----------
screen and charger that's all i need

---------18:41----------
what's also interesting on this one if

---------18:43----------
pp bus is short at the ground you get 5

---------18:44----------
volts instead of 20.

---------18:47----------
because i wasn't getting uh 20 volts

---------18:49----------
until i removed that short

---------18:57----------
wait i forgot these stupid cables with

---------18:58----------
the metal on the top

---------19:01----------
okay five volts 200 milliamps

---------19:06----------
20 volts no boots is want to make screw

---------19:09----------
you

---------19:10----------
in the words of vince mcmahon screw you

---------19:13----------
you're fired

---------19:14----------
one amp give me an image

---------19:18----------
image apple logo oh my god holy [ __ ]

---------19:22----------
what the [ __ ] let's see is it boot all

---------19:26----------
the way

---------19:26----------
okay i'm just getting greedy you have to

---------19:30----------
see

---------19:31----------
i'm four layers deep

---------19:35----------
please bro sorry i forgot to bring that

---------19:38----------
back

---------19:40----------
what'd you do i dug four layers deep for

---------19:43----------
a peepee bus short that exploded and

---------19:44----------
left the

---------19:45----------
little hole in the board and i like i it

---------19:48----------
was

---------19:49----------
at fif a one ohm then it was 50 ohms and

---------19:51----------
100 ohms and 2000 and i got it to 10 000

---------19:53----------
i kept cutting away at it

---------19:57----------
no fan spin i didn't plug it in i just

---------19:59----------
want the data i could care less about

---------20:00----------
the rest

---------20:01----------
come on boot you [ __ ] boot

---------20:04----------
what what oh

---------20:08----------
that's such a troll all right as you can

---------20:10----------
see it boots

---------20:13----------
into an operating system

---------20:17----------
fastboot it took like a minute and a

---------20:18----------
half no but there was no bar

---------20:20----------
oh yeah all of a sudden it was just

---------20:21----------
there i think the new ones don't have a

---------20:23----------
bar

---------20:24----------
wow look at this

---------20:29----------
look at this

---------20:37----------
you know would be really cool is if we

---------20:38----------
had software that showed you what the

---------20:40----------
bottom

---------20:41----------
put green stuff and call it good as new

---------20:44----------
it would be because with you know

---------20:45----------
zxw it tells you what's under the layers

---------20:47----------
like layer two layer three level four

---------20:49----------
for long screw damage it would be cool

---------20:50----------
if we what is that like what is that

---------20:52----------
that that that what if i had to peel

---------20:53----------
that

---------20:54----------
i've been doing that for for specific

---------20:56----------
areas on boards i've been peeling them

---------20:58----------
back and taking pictures

---------21:00----------
so that we know where it is what what's

---------21:02----------
there

---------21:03----------
specifically of the one the one i did

---------21:05----------
was underneath the um

---------21:06----------
keyboard connector oh because that's

---------21:09----------
been a really bad spot that does that

---------21:11----------
this is awesome so should i put the

---------21:13----------
capacitors back i'm kind of afraid

---------21:15----------
if i put heat like the layers merging or

---------21:17----------
something do you really need those

---------21:19----------
capacitors you've got so many as is

---------21:21----------
pp bus pp bus cpu is such a [ __ ] rail

---------21:24----------
it's like it's already flat you don't

---------21:25----------
need all this anti-ripple rubbish

---------21:29----------
yeah maybe all right

---------21:32----------
you know what i'm gonna put the caps

---------21:33----------
back on that

---------21:35----------
should i put a cap back on that i'm kind

---------21:36----------
of you know i'm not i'll put a cap here

---------21:39----------
i'll put i'll put this one back you're

---------21:41----------
not getting this one back [ __ ] out of

---------21:42----------
here you need

---------21:43----------
this no you'll get i'll give you this

---------21:45----------
one but not this one

---------21:47----------
so i gotta find a donor put that on

---------21:49----------
there and then we will call this a day

---------21:52----------
fixed working holy crap

---------21:56----------
wow

---------22:02----------
so many people assume that i'm smart

---------22:04----------
rather than just assuming that it's

---------22:07----------
you know a sociopath with uh with an

---------22:09----------
exacto knife

---------22:11----------
because realistically speak you could

---------22:12----------
pay me to do this all day honestly

---------22:14----------
i would do this for free like if you

---------22:16----------
told me that you

---------22:18----------
you would give me a job i would get two

---------22:19----------
bucks an hour but i just had to take a

---------22:21----------
knife and just beat the [ __ ] and stab

---------22:23----------
apple products all day i'd probably do

---------22:24----------
it for two bucks an hour

---------22:26----------
honestly i do this for free i can't tell

---------22:27----------
the customer that i can't tell the

---------22:29----------
customer that because they got to pay

---------22:30----------
for this data recovery so i could pay

---------22:31----------
rent

---------22:32----------
staff insurance and all that other horse

---------22:34----------
[ __ ] but i'd do this for free

---------22:37----------
scrape an apple product scrape scrape

---------22:40----------
scrape

---------22:41----------
all right let me get a donor board grab

---------22:43----------
some caps and put it on there

---------22:45----------
can you at least fill the hole with some

---------22:46----------
green uv resin

---------22:48----------
if it'll make you happy fine

---------22:52----------
fine

---------23:00----------
okay so that is the pp bus end

---------23:04----------
of the cap i need to grab another one

---------23:10----------
okay i'll put one cap there

---------23:16----------
only one

---------23:19----------
nope don't touch it anymore it's gonna

---------23:21----------
bother me

---------23:22----------
the rail is rippling the rail is not

---------23:25----------
supposed to ripple

---------23:27----------
please fill hole with uv and two caps in

---------23:30----------
the place of one

---------23:32----------
oh that's fine we'll think about it okay

---------23:37----------
i really want to limit what i do to this

---------23:44----------
we have to be very careful data first

---------23:50----------
i believe

---------24:01----------
i believe in myself today

---------24:06----------
i believe i can fly

---------24:10----------
at 12.56 volts my pp bus will touch the

---------24:16----------
sky

---------24:23----------
do you think the data recovery place

---------24:25----------
will sell it back to the customer as

---------24:26----------
fixed

---------24:27----------
i don't think they care one way or the

---------24:28----------
other when you do data recovery you

---------24:30----------
usually give the customer back something

---------24:32----------
and you tell them like listen if this

---------24:34----------
works it's a bonus but don't expect it

---------24:44----------
to this is the way of the world the

---------24:47----------
better

---------24:47----------
advertising capitalized businesses will

---------24:50----------
charge two to eight thousand dollars for

---------24:52----------
work that i did for a few hundred bucks

---------25:06----------
i'm not going to put another cap on top

---------25:08----------
of that because i don't really have a

---------25:10----------
i don't really feel like stacking it i

---------25:13----------
have no desire for this to

---------25:15----------
this board to um have pressure on it

---------25:19----------
after this so that's good enough for me

---------25:22----------
just clean this thing up

---------25:38----------
you know nadia i still have problems

---------25:40----------
listening to that uh

---------25:42----------
aaliyah age ain't nothing but a number

---------25:44----------
album track four the self-titled track i

---------25:46----------
really like it's a very

---------25:48----------
honestly he he was a he was a good

---------25:50----------
musician he was a talented beat maker

---------25:52----------
i'll give him that

---------25:53----------
because i actually enjoyed listening to

---------25:55----------
that and then i found out the history of

---------25:57----------
him as a human and then it kind of

---------25:58----------
creeped me out and i couldn't enjoy it

---------26:00----------
anymore and

---------26:03----------
but i enjoyed the music

---------26:09----------
put another to the right yeah but then i

---------26:12----------
gotta like find some funky way to stick

---------26:14----------
it to the board it's just

---------26:19----------
i don't need that other cap there

---------26:41----------
do you mind if i call you at the shop

---------26:42----------
for a brief talk you'll never get me

---------26:46----------
we get over 600 calls a day and that's

---------26:48----------
excluding people that

---------26:50----------
caught that phone in their youtube

---------26:51----------
comments so uh

---------26:53----------
i don't i don't pick up anymore ever

---------26:58----------
you're welcome to call if you have a

---------27:00----------
question

---------27:01----------
but most likely kevin or

---------27:04----------
shane or someone else will be answering

---------27:10----------
yeah like streaming would be impossible

---------27:11----------
if i actually answered the phone

---------27:15----------
now the fun part here is going to be

---------27:17----------
putting a layer of green

---------27:18----------
[ __ ]

---------27:24----------
the other part of the cap is not

---------27:26----------
connected to anything anymore

---------27:31----------
perhaps it isn't

---------27:36----------
one way to find out

---------27:48----------
this is uvh-900 this is the green stuff

---------27:52----------
that i use to you cure it with uv

---------27:57----------
it's very useful because what you can do

---------27:58----------
is let's say you mess up something under

---------28:00----------
a bga package you can put this there

---------28:03----------
clean up your work and then solder the

---------28:05----------
bga chip on top

---------28:06----------
the heat from your soldering is not

---------28:08----------
going to mess up the green goo

---------28:10----------
so it's really cool that it cures with

---------28:12----------
uv and not heat

---------28:22----------
thank you vincius for the euro

---------28:37----------
all right let's make sure that my short

---------28:38----------
is still gone

---------28:40----------
before i cure it because god knows if i

---------28:42----------
don't make sure the short is gone before

---------28:44----------
i cure it the short will not be gone

---------28:51----------
short is gone

---------28:54----------
all right next oh first i i got

---------28:58----------
a little bit of green [ __ ] on the other

---------28:59----------
side of the board

---------29:07----------
now i actually got this corona killer uv

---------29:09----------
thing so i usually use

---------29:11----------
my normal little uv pen

---------29:15----------
but it's not as fun now that i have the

---------29:16----------
corona killer i got this corona killer

---------29:19----------
for the office

---------29:22----------
see because i have a little uv pen

---------29:27----------
see where's my uv pen here we go i have

---------29:29----------
this little thing but

---------29:30----------
i have so much of it here by the way

---------29:33----------
for those watching this is a uv pen so

---------29:35----------
if you look at your screen you're going

---------29:37----------
to be seeing uv light right now and it's

---------29:38----------
going to burn you like the sun

---------29:40----------
so look away

---------29:47----------
i'm gonna i'm gonna use the corona

---------29:48----------
killer

---------29:50----------
this here is the corona killer

---------29:54----------
20 watt corona killer this is my little

---------29:56----------
uv pen

---------29:58----------
but the uv pen doesn't really do much

---------30:01----------
it's like a little uv pen

---------30:02----------
it's a little uv pen this here

---------30:06----------
this is this is the curing machine all

---------30:09----------
right

---------30:10----------
this is i got my uv goggles on

---------30:20----------
time to cure this mofo

---------30:24----------
[Laughter]

---------30:32----------
die corona die

---------30:48----------
i'm not pointing this at at my arms or

---------30:51----------
skin

---------30:52----------
at all because if i do

---------30:55----------
i get 20 watts of uv burn i'm just gonna

---------30:59----------
clean off and de-corona my [ __ ]

---------31:01----------
d corona bye bye corona no corona on my

---------31:05----------
multimeter

---------31:06----------
no corona on this above all no corona on

---------31:09----------
my little

---------31:12----------
erica got me this the first things that

---------31:15----------
she sent me

---------31:16----------
was my little border pair helper

---------31:19----------
all right let's see if it's decorated

---------31:30----------
all right so let's see what's what's

---------31:31----------
this doing here so this is cured

---------31:34----------
it's not cured as well as i'd like so

---------31:35----------
i'm still going to add some more uv

---------31:38----------
using my little pen

---------31:47----------
okay let's see how strong this is now

---------31:53----------
i think that'll survive the test of time

---------31:55----------
and poking
