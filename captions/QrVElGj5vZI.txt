---------00:04----------
here we have a retina macbook that has

---------00:06----------
no power try and figure out why the SE

---------00:09----------
1502 has no power by opening it up one

---------00:11----------
of the cool things about Paul s being

---------00:13----------
gone is that I get to do all the easy

---------00:16----------
jobs for the next two weeks

---------00:18----------
typically all the easy jobs got

---------00:20----------
designated to Paul but finally getting a

---------00:22----------
crack at a vacation I mean this isn't a

---------00:24----------
vacation I'm still at work but the

---------00:26----------
clothes let's face it the closest thing

---------00:27----------
you can get to a vacation are doing all

---------00:29----------
the jobs that Paul used to do because

---------00:31----------
this stuff is easy yeah so this is

---------00:35----------
intermittently turning on and off aka

---------00:37----------
random random still drawing 30 and 90

---------00:46----------
milliamps in a loop it's going to take

---------00:48----------
our multimeter and go through our power

---------00:50----------
rails and see what we get let's check

---------00:51----------
our PP bus and see if it's g3 hot

---------00:55----------
P P bus is twelve point six volts next

---------00:59----------
up we're gonna check PP 5 es 5 check PP

---------01:02----------
5 es 5 PP 5 es 5 is ou 5 to 5 volts 5 4

---------01:16----------
volts 2 volts 1 volt three bones 5 volts

---------01:19----------
3 volts 2 volts 1 volt 5 volts

---------01:25----------
interesting so we're gonna open up a

---------01:28----------
board view here for an 8 to 0 a 30 for

---------01:30----------
76 math book so this is looping which is

---------01:33----------
nice because it sucks when a power rail

---------01:35----------
just missing and there's nothing there's

---------01:36----------
no activity so this trip is responsible

---------01:38----------
for 3 rails so if one rail is not

---------01:39----------
working then all three of them are gonna

---------01:42----------
boot loop if one of them is shorted to

---------01:43----------
ground and typically the other two are

---------01:44----------
also gonna be messed up because they all

---------01:46----------
share one common chip which is gonna be

---------01:48----------
creating them all so I'm gonna check and

---------01:49----------
see if there's a short to ground than

---------01:51----------
any of the other rails and chip is

---------01:52----------
responsible for creating maybe 5 es 5 is

---------01:56----------
not shorted to ground

---------02:00----------
maybe five es four is not shorted to

---------02:02----------
ground p3 v3 s5 is so none of these are

---------02:08----------
actually sure it's a girl babe oh you

---------02:12----------
gotta check the rails upstream so we got

---------02:14----------
to check all the upstream arounds here

---------02:16----------
so we're gonna check PP 5 es 3 B 5 ESO

---------02:19----------
people 3 b3 yes so let's see if any of

---------02:23----------
them are missing yeah let's see where

---------02:25----------
they are

---------02:28----------
- b5 ESO is not short it's brown all

---------02:38----------
right here we go

---------02:39----------
so I believe I have found our short so I

---------02:43----------
went down the list of rails that are

---------02:44----------
related to the chip that's power cycling

---------02:46----------
so PP 5vs5 is power cycling that chip is

---------02:48----------
the chip to make 55 es 5 p b3 b3 s 5 +

---------02:52----------
55 es for now so I went number those

---------02:55----------
rails are shorted to ground so then we

---------02:56----------
start looking at the rails that are then

---------02:58----------
created as sub routes of that which is

---------02:59----------
gonna be P P 3 P 3 s 3 p p3 creosote or

---------03:01----------
PP 5 es o and P P 3 B 3 S 4 is the one

---------03:04----------
that seems to be short-circuited here

---------03:06----------
now I'm gonna guess that the short could

---------03:07----------
be this capacitor over here but maybe

---------03:10----------
not because hmm even though there was a

---------03:12----------
solder ball next to that that's not

---------03:13----------
something they found that pp 3 P 3 S 4

---------03:14----------
line that's for rail so let's see what

---------03:17----------
else on that line that looks nasty this

---------03:20----------
does not look nasty this does not look

---------03:24----------
nasty

---------03:29----------
this does not look nice oh yeah so this

---------03:32----------
is where people through p3s forest so I

---------03:34----------
can't find the short easily so I'm going

---------03:35----------
to inject some voltage into that short

---------03:37----------
and see if I can burn it up okay so now

---------03:40----------
we are going to inject some voltage into

---------03:42----------
this board this is my favorite time of

---------03:43----------
the day because you get to blow [ __ ] up

---------03:46----------
blowing stuff up is that the most fun

---------03:48----------
part of this job I love blowing stuff up

---------03:51----------
I hope I never have I'm at a point where

---------03:54----------
I'm not allowed to blow things up

---------03:55----------
anymore yeah but Chris long yes the

---------04:00----------
connector is still in decent condition

---------04:01----------
yeah all right awesome yeah that's fine

---------04:06----------
hey guy would you pay for I imagine it's

---------04:08----------
good connector Chris long you got a

---------04:10----------
connector coming your way it's it we

---------04:12----------
actually KaiKai didn't have time to

---------04:14----------
desolder so I just clipped off the piece

---------04:15----------
of the board with the connector

---------04:23----------
California is a shitty state that's why

---------04:26----------
everybody in California is moving to

---------04:28----------
Texas have you ever seen those bumper

---------04:31----------
stickers they have in Texas that says

---------04:33----------
Texas is not California in all caps I

---------04:35----------
love it everything causes cancer in

---------04:38----------
California I think just living in

---------04:40----------
California causes cancer by virtue of

---------04:42----------
the people there all right so let's

---------04:49----------
inject some voltage let's burn this

---------04:51----------
board up

---------04:57----------
where is my short

---------05:12----------
I'm misusing alcohol to find shorts this

---------05:14----------
these were the days all right so it's

---------05:17----------
somewhere in this area that our shortest

---------05:19----------
so let's figure this up yeah yep that

---------05:26----------
little capacitor it's a tube at 2.5

---------05:29----------
volts it's using 6.3 m/s that's insane

---------05:33----------
now we're gonna remove that capacitor

---------05:36----------
and make this Mac look great again by

---------05:41----------
the way everybody say good night to

---------05:42----------
Kevin he did an amazing job today this

---------05:44----------
customer after customer after customer

---------05:45----------
and he kicked ass and troll calls and

---------05:48----------
troll calls and half of them patrol

---------05:50----------
calls with probably all you [ __ ] Kevin

---------05:52----------
take a bow for you excellent performance

---------05:53----------
today that's stylish

---------06:06----------
you

---------06:14----------
all right now we're just gonna make sure

---------06:16----------
that our short circuit is completely

---------06:18----------
gone and also see what that capacitor

---------06:22----------
campus sitter actually was for so it

---------06:24----------
looks like that capacitor or something

---------06:26----------
to do with the Thunderbolt circuit this

---------06:28----------
is gonna go to you 2800 you 2800 is our

---------06:32----------
Thunderbolt controller right over here

---------06:34----------
one of the reasons that I like scraping

---------06:36----------
thunderbolt off of the board like a

---------06:37----------
broken appendix exploding appendix by

---------06:46----------
the way everybody today is one of the

---------06:48----------
lead reassembly testing screen repair

---------06:50----------
technicians is birthday everybody wish

---------06:52----------
to gear a happy birthday

---------07:12----------
this is a MacBook this is a macbook

---------07:15----------
charger this is a macbook fan and this

---------07:22----------
is a macbook fan spinning yeah oh yeah

---------07:27----------
short detection without a thermal cam

---------07:29----------
using nothing but alcohol you can get

---------07:31----------
any local drugstore without having to

---------07:33----------
spend $900 so that's it and we fixed the

---------07:38----------
board I'm sure everything else in this

---------07:40----------
board is gonna work just fine we've done

---------07:41----------
a quality control fully tested just

---------07:43----------
ignore those little sparks that you

---------07:44----------
heard right there I'm sure everything's

---------07:45----------
gonna be just fine on this MacBook so

---------07:48----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------07:49----------
you learned something
