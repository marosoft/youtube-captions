---------00:00----------
I mark up my prices but I also don't lie

---------00:01----------
about the [ __ ] that I'm selling and

---------00:03----------
claiming something it's not commercial

---------00:05----------
real estate

---------00:09----------
[Music]

---------00:18----------
the part that's really [ __ ] up that

---------00:20----------
was a trace that did not actually have

---------00:22----------
any damage between the diode and the SMC

---------00:25----------
so what that means is that this board is

---------00:27----------
so far damaged that there are traces

---------00:29----------
inside of the actual motherboard that I

---------00:32----------
can't see that are broken this is

---------00:34----------
actually where having the money for

---------00:36----------
something like a Norton 3d x-ray machine

---------00:38----------
would come in handy because I can use my

---------00:40----------
brain to some extent to give you an idea

---------00:42----------
of where the problem is so I didn't need

---------00:46----------
to even see that that trace was broken

---------00:48----------
in order to know that it wasn't

---------00:49----------
communicating even though I didn't have

---------00:51----------
a short and I had 3.42 vaults in the

---------00:53----------
data line by the SMC I knew to check for

---------00:56----------
it over there because I understood how

---------00:58----------
the circuit worked but when we start

---------01:00----------
getting into why the machine is brain

---------01:02----------
dead that's far too open-ended it's not

---------01:05----------
a very simple this little thing talks to

---------01:07----------
that little thing kind of problem and in

---------01:09----------
Norton 3d x-ray machine would actually

---------01:11----------
be able to show me inside of the board

---------01:12----------
what is broken so that I could fix it so

---------01:15----------
think of it kind of like a neural link

---------01:17----------
in Nord sin 3d X marish even 3d x-ray

---------01:19----------
machine would be kind of like my brain

---------01:21----------
but on steroids now the problem is that

---------01:23----------
machines about 120,000 bucks and I have

---------01:26----------
failed so badly in business and in life

---------01:28----------
that I can barely even afford to move

---------01:31----------
into a new store with even floors to the

---------01:33----------
point where my air conditioner is gonna

---------01:36----------
you know there's gonna be an air

---------01:37----------
conditioner that's on a fox wall that

---------01:39----------
doesn't even not even there anymore

---------01:42----------
because I suck if I was a real business

---------01:45----------
owner like a real business owner not a

---------01:47----------
fake ass business owner I would be able

---------01:49----------
to go oh that's something that could

---------01:50----------
help my business oh my business based on

---------01:53----------
boarder pair in that machine would take

---------01:54----------
us to the next level let's just grab it

---------01:56----------
but I'm not so when people think you

---------01:58----------
deserve to take a vacation you deserve

---------02:01----------
time off you earn this that and the

---------02:02----------
other I haven't I haven't really earned

---------02:04----------
jack [ __ ]

---------02:05----------
I've actually aren't quite

---------02:06----------
underperformed given that there are

---------02:08----------
several other companies out there that

---------02:09----------
exist that if they wanted something like

---------02:11----------
that they just you know pick up the

---------02:13----------
phone and have the resources to be able

---------02:14----------
to get it because it would be really

---------02:15----------
cool to just put this thing in there and

---------02:17----------
have a known good 8 to 0-0 0 4 to 6 and

---------02:21----------
this one and just have it literally pop

---------02:23----------
up and show all the bond wires and then

---------02:25----------
we could overlay it see what the

---------02:26----------
differences are between the two and then

---------02:28----------
just run the single jumper wire that's

---------02:30----------
necessary

---------02:30----------
to make this work again and there's a

---------02:32----------
lot of jumper wires that you can figure

---------02:33----------
out by using your brain but there's that

---------02:35----------
last five to ten percent that you can't

---------02:37----------
do that the machine probably could whoa

---------02:39----------
five volts on screen five volts on

---------02:42----------
screen [ __ ] dorsen ah who needs a neural

---------02:47----------
link [ __ ]

---------02:49----------
oh-ho question mark folder question mark

---------02:53----------
that is awesome

---------02:55----------
suck my dick Norton 3d x-ray machine man

---------03:01----------
I actually kind of felt sorry for myself

---------03:02----------
there a little bit I actually felt a

---------03:05----------
little bit sorry for myself like you

---------03:07----------
know 11 years in business and I'm such a

---------03:09----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] that I can't buy one

---------03:13----------
[ __ ] tool that would help my business

---------03:15----------
and make life easier for everybody here

---------03:18----------
take us to the next level allow us to

---------03:20----------
learn more allow us to do more

---------03:21----------
educational videos because if we can

---------03:23----------
actually figure out the trace if we

---------03:25----------
could figure out the ones that we're not

---------03:26----------
able to now we were actually able to

---------03:28----------
learn something like oh when you have

---------03:29----------
this problem it's that trace and then we

---------03:31----------
can figure out why and we could really

---------03:32----------
reverse engineer around it I don't need

---------03:35----------
that cuz I got my [ __ ] brain yeah

---------03:38----------
[ __ ] you chase bank I don't need your

---------03:41----------
[ __ ] money to open my new store suck

---------03:43----------
my dick

---------03:44----------
yeah this is awesome oh I don't need no

---------03:49----------
goddamn bank loan I got a question mark

---------03:51----------
folder it only took me four hours and 47

---------03:55----------
minutes fix a computer that's four years

---------03:58----------
old but still accomplishment oh I'm

---------04:01----------
gonna look back on this dream and I'm

---------04:03----------
gonna be very aggravated that I ever did

---------04:05----------
it but there's one other thing I want to

---------04:07----------
check now that I know it works

---------04:08----------
what is DD uh what is that vtt voltage

---------04:11----------
supposed to be is three is it supposed

---------04:13----------
to be six volts is the schematic wrong

---------04:14----------
let's see okay what do we got here okay

---------04:17----------
can I measure on the top of the board

---------04:18----------
I got x-ray vision with my [ __ ]

---------04:21----------
eyeballs

---------04:22----------
that's such I don't need no x-ray

---------04:25----------
machine I don't know but that just gave

---------04:28----------
me a jolt oh it feels good dopamine rush

---------04:32----------
figuring out a [ __ ] up board like this

---------04:35----------
yeah what the [ __ ] it's supposed to be

---------04:38----------
0.34 volts [ __ ] you Apple oh that is so

---------04:42----------
[ __ ] up I was chasing that issue

---------04:44----------
like 30 [ __ ] minutes because of the

---------04:46----------
shitty documentation here

---------04:48----------
it's 0.34 volts but when you look on the

---------04:52----------
schematic the schematic clearly states

---------04:54----------
on the power aliases page that that is

---------04:58----------
supposed to be 0.67 5 volts 0.67 5 volts

---------05:06----------
and it's 0.35 volts and it works why why

---------05:10----------
does your documentation have to suck

---------05:15----------
it's just like these new machines where

---------05:18----------
it says oh my god this is annoying this

---------05:21----------
is so aggravating it's like when it says

---------05:23----------
18 volts input where it's supposed to be

---------05:25----------
12 or 8 this is like where they say is

---------05:27----------
l6 2 5 9 and the new machines when it's

---------05:29----------
supposed to be is l9 2 3 9 or is all 9 2

---------05:32----------
4 0 like that is I wasted a half at

---------05:35----------
[ __ ] our teeth - 2:30 in the morning

---------05:37----------
because of apples [ __ ] documentation why

---------05:41----------
is right to repair even argue why are we

---------05:43----------
even advocating to get access to these

---------05:45----------
original schematics they suck somebody

---------05:49----------
else should write up a proper one they

---------05:51----------
don't even know what voltage their own

---------05:53----------
[ __ ] power rails are in this are you

---------05:55----------
kidding me are you kidding me oh this

---------05:57----------
board for your software is kidding me -

---------05:59----------
there's a drunk Paul Daniels software

---------06:01----------
opening up in this funky orientation hey

---------06:05----------
look at this look at this look at this

---------06:08----------
dumbass [ __ ] this is the board view in

---------06:10----------
schematic front is eight two zero zero

---------06:12----------
zero two three nine we still use it is

---------06:14----------
so six to five no I mean you don't you

---------06:18----------
use ISO nine 239 correct your [ __ ]

---------06:21----------
data sheets lay this this is l6 259 you

---------06:24----------
click to the next page it says is l9 two

---------06:27----------
three nine but you click back over there

---------06:29----------
and this is ISO six two five nine but

---------06:31----------
you click here and this is ISO nine two

---------06:32----------
three nine me to click there inside so

---------06:34----------
if I survived I'm gonna click here

---------06:34----------
inside some why you lazy ass Apple

---------06:38----------
engineers document your [ __ ] machines

---------06:40----------
properly so that I can go home in time I

---------06:44----------
feel good I felt good though I really

---------06:48----------
started feeling sorry for myself I'm a

---------06:51----------
failed business owner

---------06:53----------
can't figure out jack [ __ ] can't fix the

---------06:56----------
board's can't even afford a single

---------06:58----------
[ __ ] machine that would make my life

---------07:00----------
a lot easier after 11 years because I

---------07:03----------
suck at business that much I'll need

---------07:09----------
your money Chase Bank I got my brain

---------07:17----------
that's it for today everybody and as

---------07:19----------
always I hope you learned something hey

---------07:21----------
everybody how's it going so today we're

---------07:22----------
gonna be fixing another MacBook here we

---------07:26----------
have in a 1398 it's this power slash

---------07:28----------
display issue let's open this thing up

---------07:30----------
and see what's going on with it and see

---------07:32----------
if we can fix it so we open it up it

---------07:34----------
looks like this one is a 2015-16 model

---------07:39----------
with a discrete GPU that's an 8 to 0-0 0

---------07:41----------
4 to 6 motherboard the number is right

---------07:43----------
over there if you can't read it you may

---------07:44----------
want to get your eyes checked because

---------07:45----------
that's clearly visible and this machine

---------07:48----------
is supposed to be having power issues as

---------07:50----------
well as display issues so let's see

---------07:53----------
what's going on with the power slash

---------07:56----------
display so I'm gonna take mine MagSafe

---------07:59----------
connector as I always do I'm gonna

---------08:01----------
unplug the battery because I want to see

---------08:02----------
how many amps the thing is taking just a

---------08:04----------
logic board by itself not the battery it

---------08:07----------
looks like we're taking 200 milliamps

---------08:08----------
that is not enough to get this thing

---------08:10----------
started up that is not enough to get a

---------08:12----------
quad-core CPU and GPU started up this

---------08:14----------
thing is starting but it's most likely

---------08:16----------
brain dead 200 and milliamps is not even

---------08:20----------
close to enough to get going with this

---------08:22----------
machine so I'm fairly certain that this

---------08:24----------
thing is gonna have nothing on the

---------08:26----------
screen as well as be brain dead and it

---------08:29----------
says that there's no chime slash display

---------08:32----------
now I'm just gonna see if we have any

---------08:35----------
volts on the actual display itself I

---------08:38----------
don't expect the backlight but let's see

---------08:39----------
if the things at least trying to make

---------08:42----------
bring an image to the screen and it's

---------08:43----------
not even trying to do that so I'm going

---------08:45----------
to take the board out of the case and

---------08:47----------
see what the other side looks like and

---------08:48----------
see if this is something that maybe

---------08:50----------
solvable or if this is just the board

---------08:52----------
that goes to Paul caching here we go so

---------09:01----------
this machine is brain-dead now what's

---------09:02----------
causing it to be brain dead the first

---------09:05----------
question we have here look at the case

---------09:08----------
what do you see the case is actually

---------09:10----------
speaking to you see that that's the

---------09:13----------
keyboard backlight this black layer over

---------09:14----------
here what is the peel what does that say

---------09:17----------
what does that say

---------09:19----------
did I tell you anything I would hope

---------09:22----------
that that tells you something now I

---------09:24----------
don't think I have a bored view for this

---------09:25----------
one I don't think anybody's taken part

---------09:27----------
in the reprehensible immoral activity of

---------09:30----------
emailing an eight to zero - zero zero

---------09:32----------
four to six bored view - Lewis a trosman

---------09:34----------
group comm I don't think anybody's done

---------09:37----------
that which is a good thing because if

---------09:39----------
they did they would be breaking the law

---------09:40----------
and making Tim Cook angry and if you

---------09:42----------
make Tim Cook angry I hear that a kitten

---------09:44----------
dies every time you help somebody fix a

---------09:48----------
Macbook doing something that Tim Cook

---------09:49----------
would find personally reprehensible a

---------09:51----------
kitten dies so I'm gonna open up a board

---------09:54----------
view to a similar board of that year the

---------09:55----------
eight to 0-2 zero zero one six three

---------09:57----------
it's almost the same thing so this is

---------09:59----------
the closest thing that we've got so the

---------10:04----------
chip that's corroded is you 7400 and you

---------10:08----------
7400 is the 1.35 volt power supply for

---------10:11----------
the ramp now keep in mind this computer

---------10:13----------
is turning on you see when it turns on

---------10:15----------
at the fan spin it's taking 200

---------10:17----------
milliamps but the reason it's not fully

---------10:18----------
booting is that the RAM power supply is

---------10:20----------
not there so imagine if you had the RAM

---------10:22----------
plugged into your computer but you sent

---------10:23----------
no power to it that's what's happening

---------10:25----------
with this what's interesting is that

---------10:26----------
it's not we beeping which is interesting

---------10:28----------
which I wouldn't be expecting and we

---------10:30----------
also have corrosion on a bunch of stuff

---------10:32----------
around here let's see what the this

---------10:33----------
little cluster of stars is for so on the

---------10:36----------
schematic this looks like a bunch of

---------10:38----------
pull-up resistors for random things SPI

---------10:40----------
SMC mossie so that's BIOS communication

---------10:44----------
with the SMC is corroded yeah so all

---------10:46----------
this stuff is gonna have to get and I

---------10:48----------
don't want to destroy any of those pads

---------10:51----------
and this is gonna smell though so I'm

---------10:53----------
probably gonna regret what I'm doing

---------10:54----------
here what I'm doing here is I'm turning

---------10:57----------
on the fume extractor and I'm gonna flux

---------10:59----------
it in hot air it to C key I have not

---------11:02----------
signed off yet because there's all a

---------11:03----------
there's a lot of stuff to fix and B want

---------11:07----------
the new store to be even remotely usable

---------11:11----------
there's a lot of money to make

---------11:15----------
I'm excited about moving to this new

---------11:16----------
place and I'm gonna do it whether the

---------11:19----------
money is there right now or not because

---------11:22----------
I know in my heart of hearts that we

---------11:25----------
will make it work and that more that

---------11:28----------
this company will become a much better

---------11:30----------
company once we're operating in a proper

---------11:31----------
space so I'm gonna stay here until I

---------11:35----------
fixed every board there is the fix and

---------11:38----------
once there is nothing left to fix I'll

---------11:39----------
find more stuff to fix it I'm an

---------11:41----------
ambulance chaser all right so first

---------11:44----------
things first I'm gonna just flow that

---------11:46----------
into place now the reason I'm doing this

---------11:51----------
is I don't want to put this - the

---------11:52----------
ultrasonic because if I put it through

---------11:55----------
the ultrasonic that stuff that's barely

---------11:57----------
hanging on may get washed away and no

---------12:02----------
brain is a really difficult problem to

---------12:03----------
solve so I want to save and preserve as

---------12:05----------
much as I'm able to save and preserve

---------12:07----------
here

---------12:10----------
[Music]

---------12:42----------
now it's time to start knocking off junk

---------12:44----------
that looks disgusting today we can start

---------12:47----------
shuttering on stuff that looks good it

---------12:50----------
may start up after a reflow but I don't

---------12:52----------
want to keep this stuff on the board

---------12:53----------
looking like this

---------12:54----------
I can't reasonably give this back to a

---------12:56----------
customer in this condition if I were an

---------12:59----------
[ __ ] and this worked after a reflow

---------13:01----------
you know what I would do if I were an

---------13:02----------
[ __ ] I would give this back to the

---------13:04----------
customer and say you got a 90 day

---------13:06----------
warranty on board repair and then when

---------13:08----------
this piece of [ __ ] fails in 95 days I

---------13:11----------
would charge the money again if I were a

---------13:14----------
real [ __ ] I would do this on eBay

---------13:17----------
what because on eBay they can only leave

---------13:20----------
feedback for a certain period of time

---------13:21----------
and if it fails outside of that they're

---------13:23----------
actually unable to change their feedback

---------13:24----------
it's one of the reasons that there's a

---------13:26----------
real large discrepancy in reviews for

---------13:29----------
the Reeb Alling services videos for bad

---------13:32----------
GPUs between eBay and places like Yelp

---------13:35----------
or Google so a lot of those reflow

---------13:37----------
places is like one-star yelp in Google

---------13:40----------
but five-star 99.999% positive feedback

---------13:44----------
on eBay because they can't edit the

---------13:45----------
feedback after the piece of [ __ ] fails

---------13:49----------
now they're stuck

---------14:02----------
so now I'm hoping that I preserved the

---------14:06----------
pad so I'm not ripping any when I do my

---------14:08----------
cleaning mani go through this nice and

---------14:13----------
easy

---------14:16----------
they're gonna do this very methodically

---------14:18----------
so that this is as good as it was when

---------14:20----------
it was new if not better as a result of

---------14:23----------
the stuff being I mean a nice attention

---------14:25----------
to detail you can see over there where

---------14:27----------
we got a little solder ball sticking out

---------14:29----------
from the side of the chip you're not

---------14:31----------
gonna see that on a board when we're

---------14:32----------
done with it

---------14:33----------
we don't treat our customers like that

---------14:41----------
okay now one of the first things you may

---------14:44----------
notice that needs to be worked on here

---------14:46----------
before we do much of anything else is

---------14:50----------
the pad over there that has to be knifed

---------14:52----------
away because it's all red even if that

---------14:55----------
did work after reflow I would never

---------14:56----------
trust it because I mean you could see

---------14:59----------
even before I removed the chip that

---------15:00----------
there was going to be some serious

---------15:01----------
corrosion over there

---------15:05----------
[Music]

---------15:09----------
now I'm soldering on top of corrosion

---------15:11----------
there so I'm not going to keep that

---------15:13----------
that's going to have to be adjusted and

---------15:17----------
it's gonna have to be wiped

---------15:24----------
so after that and now the one of the

---------15:27----------
things I said in one of the older

---------15:28----------
streams is that the desoldering wick is

---------15:32----------
actually very useful as kind of like a

---------15:36----------
nail filer or sandpaper

---------15:38----------
so once now that I've gone over that I'm

---------15:41----------
not just gonna remove the old solder the

---------15:43----------
cool thing about this is that it

---------15:44----------
actually allows me to really scrub down

---------15:46----------
to the pad and get rid of any dirt that

---------15:48----------
may have been on top now I don't want to

---------15:51----------
scrub too hard because I don't want to

---------15:52----------
ruin those traces and there's no real

---------15:55----------
need to expose traces that are going to

---------15:59----------
working fine pads I just want to give it

---------16:03----------
a give the board is a nice clean finish

---------16:05----------
to it before we get started on replacing

---------16:08----------
chips and soldering everything else to

---------16:10----------
it you want to work with a nice clean

---------16:11----------
canvas that's what this gets you so it's

---------16:15----------
one thing to put solder on I'm just

---------16:16----------
doing that to make this solder easier to

---------16:18----------
remove thing is putting that solder on

---------16:20----------
there you putting this like this it's

---------16:23----------
gonna make sure that I didn't put solder

---------16:24----------
on top of corrosion

---------16:43----------
okay now this is ready for all that junk

---------16:46----------
to be replaced and it's going to look so

---------16:48----------
much better

---------17:11----------
are you sleeping

---------17:20----------
well you're not sleeping interesting my

---------17:23----------
just forgotten how to use the micro

---------17:25----------
pencil tip for something

---------17:42----------
yeah I think the tip of this I need to

---------17:44----------
find the tip cleaner

---------17:53----------
[Music]

---------18:34----------
okay now for the fun part

---------19:06----------
[Music]

---------20:14----------
everything that's not perfectly in place

---------20:16----------
will be in place soon you'll see

when the beam strikes when the dog barks

---------29:10----------
when your peepee bus is gone

---------29:22----------
I just remember my trace is still there

I'm an awesome singer and

the solder mask comes off when your

my green conformal coating from stored

on Russell drip to common that I don't

feel so bad you can get fun for more

s5 high side computing still there take

---------30:25----------
a look at my board I still have my

---------30:28----------
throne right over here I can run know

---------30:31----------
why or just because it looks like it's

---------30:34----------
shorted to ground doesn't mean that I

---------30:37----------
can't get around it when the ground

---------30:40----------
strikes when Paul software doesn't work

---------30:46----------
when Australians make me feel and sad I

---------30:55----------
just remember that my boards fix a ball

---------30:58----------
and then I don't feel so bad

---------31:10----------
don't have feelings I just remember my

mr. Phelan resistor flew away Paul

---------42:46----------
Daniels do you think that's actually

---------42:47----------
gonna happen because Microsoft fired a

---------42:49----------
hell of a lot of their team that was

---------42:51----------
working on Windows not far they laid off

---------42:53----------
a lot of it which is what makes me

---------42:56----------
wonder if there's even gonna be anything

---------42:57----------
after Windows 10

---------43:05----------
how long is windows 10 been out for at

---------43:07----------
this point a long time

---------43:24----------
I think there's a good chance the

---------43:25----------
Microsoft is done with consumers ship

---------44:28----------
this boy is gonna have a brain when

---------44:30----------
we're done with it you'll see you'll see

---------44:34----------
you'll see John that's the thing though

---------44:39----------
they have different builds of it but

---------44:41----------
it's never really a revolution over the

---------44:42----------
last one not to say that Windows has

---------44:44----------
ever really revolutionaries but you can

---------44:52----------
tell the difference between XP Vista 810

---------44:57----------
in this visceral way that you just can't

---------45:00----------
with different builds of Windows 10

---------45:01----------
immediately

---------45:11----------
so that all the work that we did was go

---------45:13----------
from here to here so we did work on this

---------45:20----------
section over here and then this over

---------45:22----------
here just to give you an idea of how

---------45:24----------
small that is so all those little

---------45:25----------
resistors we replace with that square

---------45:26----------
chip the rectangle chip and the

---------45:29----------
resistors we replace is literally just

---------45:31----------
that and then the square chip where I

---------45:33----------
ran the wire is this and then just to

---------45:36----------
give you an even better idea this is the

---------45:37----------
size of my hand so just to think bring

---------45:41----------
that more into context for you this is

---------45:43----------
the size of my hand this is the size of

---------45:45----------
the first area that we worked on this is

---------45:48----------
the size of the second area that we

---------45:50----------
worked on now we're gonna see if this

---------45:55----------
machine is a brain now even with before

---------45:57----------
I plug in the screen in any of that

---------45:58----------
obviously I need to do that to make sure

---------45:59----------
that the GPU is working image is working

---------46:01----------
CPUs working but a quick way to get an

---------46:04----------
idea what's going on here let's just see

---------46:05----------
how many amps it's using because

---------46:06----------
obviously if it's using the same 200

---------46:09----------
milliamps then we're still at we have

---------46:11----------
solved the same problem of the machine

---------46:12----------
not having a brain now as you can see

---------46:16----------
here the machine is taking 1.6 to 1.7

---------46:18----------
amps that may seem high for you but

---------46:20----------
that's actually kind of standard for

---------46:22----------
this machine it has a powerful discrete

---------46:24----------
GPU as well as a quad core processor

---------46:26----------
rather than the dual core ultrabook

---------46:28----------
class processors in the old other

---------46:30----------
machines that I typically fix so I

---------46:32----------
expected to take that if MacBook Air and

---------46:34----------
a 1502

---------46:35----------
a 1706 anything like that was taking

---------46:37----------
that many amps I'd be worried but this

---------46:39----------
is about four years old in terms of CPU

---------46:42----------
and GPU you know nanometer count

---------46:45----------
whatever

---------46:45----------
nanometer size of the CPU and all that

---------46:47----------
and it's also a quad core with a GPU so

---------46:50----------
it's taking one point three amps which

---------46:52----------
makes me fairly confident that the RAM

---------46:54----------
voltage is present and that this is also

---------46:55----------
working but just in case there's

---------46:57----------
anything funny let's see what it gives

---------47:00----------
us with the screen first thing I'm gonna

---------47:01----------
do is just clean the desk here because I

---------47:03----------
don't want to put the customer hardware

---------47:05----------
on top of a filthy desk we have somebody

---------47:08----------
here who actually cleans all these

---------47:10----------
computers with some screen cleaning

---------47:13----------
spray and a microfiber cleaning cloth

---------47:16----------
but still the cleaning person will have

---------47:20----------
less to do and less chance of missing

---------47:22----------
dirt if I just don't

---------47:23----------
dirt on the computer to begin with

---------47:37----------
so let's see if this thing is turning on

---------47:39----------
the screen at all switch the multimeter

---------47:41----------
to volts mode and let's see what I get

---------47:47----------
on the screen

---------47:53----------
okay it looks like we're still brain

---------47:55----------
dead yep brain dead nothing on the

---------47:59----------
screen so let's take a look at that

---------48:01----------
power rail that ship was supposed to be

---------48:02----------
creating and see if we're actually

---------48:03----------
creating it now so the chip that was

---------48:06----------
corroded was used 7400 and you 7400 is

---------48:10----------
going to be responsible for it appears

---------48:11----------
to be two different rounds the first is

---------48:14----------
going to be DDR vtt and the other is pp

---------48:17----------
1 V 3 5 so 1.35 volts and it's also

---------48:22----------
going to shoot out whereas the pin is

---------48:25----------
going to shoot out the rest

---------48:32----------
vil Doan not to be confused with dildo

---------48:36----------
in over there

---------48:46----------
okay ppvt TSO DDR let's see where can we

---------48:50----------
measure that he has any nice large coil

---------48:55----------
we can measure that on or something or

---------48:57----------
just tiny [ __ ] okay it looks like that

---------49:00----------
can measure it up here so it looks like

---------49:07----------
DDR ppvt TSO DDR is 0.34 volts actually

---------49:13----------
not sure what that is supposed to be so

---------49:15----------
let's look that up and see if the

---------49:16----------
schematic will tell us what that's

---------49:18----------
supposed to be next

---------49:27----------
Oh point six seven five is what that's

---------49:29----------
supposed to be so that's supposed to be

---------49:31----------
0.67 five volts the Rams supposed to be

---------49:34----------
0.675 and I'm only getting point three

---------49:38----------
four so that's gonna have to get looked

---------49:40----------
at

---------49:48----------
now this chip is powered by PP 5 es 3

---------49:51----------
okay now the next thing I'm going to

---------49:52----------
check is the other rail this creates PP

---------49:54----------
1 V 3 v underscore s 3 and that's going

---------49:57----------
to be over there excuse me

---------50:07----------
okay so the 1.35 volts it's creating

---------50:10----------
just fine

---------50:11----------
it's DDR vtt that it's not creating

---------50:14----------
properly so let's see how is DDR vtt

---------50:17----------
created DDF ppvt TSO DDR it just shoots

---------50:23----------
right out of the chip there's supposed

---------50:26----------
to be a switch between vtt sends a pin 1

---------50:32----------
& 3 that's supposed to be some sort of

---------50:34----------
direct connection what is SM mean is

---------50:37----------
there like a BD missing somewhere in

---------50:38----------
there

---------50:39----------
what is SM mean I'm guessing that's

---------50:41----------
supposed to be jumper together well

---------50:43----------
we're gonna check that in C 7460 C 74-62

---------50:47----------
we're also supposed to be on output

---------50:49----------
there and then there's all supposed to

---------50:51----------
be another capacitor right so that that

---------50:54----------
those are gonna be two caps to ground

---------50:57----------
one two and you got 3 & 4 so we're just

---------51:03----------
gonna go back to the drawing board on a

---------51:05----------
couple of things and see if any of my

---------51:07----------
assumptions that were present when I was

---------51:09----------
running the wires were wrong because

---------51:11----------
perhaps I made assumptions that I

---------51:12----------
shouldn't like that there was actually

---------51:14----------
voltage showing up at certain points

---------51:16----------
that were totally corroded and destroyed

---------51:19----------
so DDR v TT v TT is on pin 3 now let's

---------51:24----------
see so firstly pin 3 is supposed to

---------51:26----------
connect to pin 1 that's interesting so

---------51:31----------
that connects TDR egg v TT sends this

---------51:36----------
now the schematic says that those two

---------51:38----------
connect

---------51:45----------
but I find that hard to believe that

---------51:46----------
they can act because the schematic view

---------51:48----------
does not I guess it does over here X W

---------51:57----------
XW

---------51:59----------
7460 and then it goes over there and

---------52:03----------
that goes over there okay so those two

---------52:07----------
are actually connected at some point

---------52:09----------
interesting and that's supposed to be a

---------52:13----------
probe point that's all the way up here

---------52:16----------
but I don't see that I don't see that

---------52:18----------
existing it's supposed to be this that

---------52:24----------
little thing see that

---------52:31----------
it is there

---------52:43----------
well one thing I imagine if it is

---------52:45----------
genuinely connected the same way that

---------52:46----------
feedback is to connect at the back light

---------52:49----------
output then it should be right

---------52:56----------
which it does okay next up see 7460 did

---------53:01----------
i okay that is all the way on the other

---------53:04----------
side of the board that's not Kuroda

---------53:06----------
don't got to worry about that so see

---------53:08----------
7460 yeah I worry about that because

---------53:11----------
that's all the way up at dokuro should

---------53:13----------
let say 4c 74-62 let's see we have 4c

---------53:16----------
74-61 same thing up in no corrosion

---------53:19----------
Lancie 7463 same thing up in no

---------53:22----------
corrosion laughs see seven four six four

---------53:27----------
okay that's near the chip so could that

---------53:29----------
be bad or see seven four six five those

---------53:33----------
two caps either of those could be bad

---------53:35----------
but those have been soldered on and I do

---------53:37----------
believe them to be good so one of the

---------53:38----------
assumptions I made is that PP VIN that's

---------53:41----------
five high side computing I sense

---------53:43----------
whatever the [ __ ] that's called was

---------53:45----------
presence perhaps it wasn't but it is

---------53:50----------
there

---------53:55----------
so am ia 12.3 well it's pp bus on this

---------54:01----------
computer 12.3 s PP bus g3 huh

---------54:11----------
no 12 point 28 you would put a

---------54:14----------
non-functioning s MC now you can take a

---------54:16----------
vacation you deserve one no I actually

---------54:18----------
have them dude I don't deserve why don't

---------54:20----------
I have not earned one

---------54:21----------
I have not hit the goal I need to pay

---------54:24----------
for the new store I am NOT taking a

---------54:27----------
vacation I'm actually gonna be working

---------54:28----------
more over the next six months to a year

---------54:30----------
almost likely with no vacation because I

---------54:35----------
have not performed as well as I'm

---------54:38----------
supposed to I have not performed well at

---------54:42----------
all honestly so we've got a lot of work

---------54:45----------
to do and that's gonna start with fixing

---------54:48----------
this piece of [ __ ] right here kind of

---------54:50----------
what have I missed here now I was

---------54:55----------
chasing something the ER reg v1 v8 could

---------55:01----------
it be a bad u7b 400 or could it be that

---------55:04----------
that rail is just as a short on it could

---------55:07----------
it be that it's since 12 volts or 5

---------55:09----------
volts to my memory and that killed it

---------55:12----------
could it be just not soldered properly

---------55:14----------
there's so many possibilities here hmm

---------55:18----------
oh yes SMC was not working because PP

---------55:22----------
buzz was low so that's yeah this isn't

---------55:24----------
shortened so that's a problem that we

---------55:25----------
have to solve first so let's look at our

---------55:28----------
SMC area the SMC looks perfect let's

---------55:35----------
look at the is l6 to 5/9 looks fine it's

---------55:39----------
a little crusty over there but yeah

---------55:45----------
do we have

---------55:46----------
what's the let's see what what's the

---------55:48----------
data line doing is the data lines to the

---------55:50----------
SMC short at the ground okay so 10 and

---------55:59----------
11 let's see what I get their point five

---------56:02----------
three zero not short it's a ground twin

---------56:05----------
five three zero not short is a ground so

---------56:07----------
this needs an SMC on top of its RAM

---------56:10----------
issue do wonder what an ultrasonic

---------56:12----------
cleaning would do for this board hmm you

---------56:16----------
got a lot of corrosion right here by

---------56:17----------
this thing what is that thing that's

---------56:20----------
right next to my memory issue Oh what

---------56:26----------
are you what are you

---------56:29----------
what's that pro point PPV bat g3 hat

---------56:33----------
charger reg hmm well that's for the ISO

---------56:38----------
six two five nine and the ISO sixty five

---------56:40----------
nine is what communicates with the SMC

---------56:41----------
and the SMC is the thing that's not

---------56:43----------
working interesting

---------56:47----------
so perhaps this shocks this corrosion

---------56:51----------
shocked my SMC I mean why is L in my is

---------56:56----------
L is speaking to my SMC and saying

---------57:00----------
something that makes it angry it's

---------57:01----------
always possible

---------57:04----------
you're anything I missed over here

---------59:04----------
point three five

---------59:07----------
what are the chances that the RAM is

---------59:09----------
dead and at this is that this is

---------59:10----------
actually wrong and that's not point six

---------59:12----------
volts but rather it's supposed to be

---------59:14----------
0.35

---------59:19----------
so what is our pp bus still low slow 12

---------59:24----------
point 28 yeah give the SMC a reflow the

---------59:30----------
ISL our place since there was corrosion

---------59:31----------
around something related to it I would

---------59:34----------
this one last look under the microscope

---------59:35----------
actually before I do that after that's

---------59:38----------
done then we got to probably replace the

---------59:39----------
SMC also crud on to the SMC could

---------59:42----------
actually keep this from finishing the

---------59:44----------
boot process but there was no nothing

---------59:48----------
nothing to give me a reason that there

---------59:49----------
was corrosion there there it gives me

---------59:52----------
agita about replacing it

---------60:48----------
let's see if it's an SMC issue I'm

---------60:51----------
inclined to think is l because there was

---------60:53----------
corrosion by something that goes to the

---------60:56----------
is all six two five nine which speaks to

---------60:58----------
the SMC which would say PP below but I'm

---------61:00----------
also Hans thing is the SMC because

---------61:02----------
that's the only thing that would make

---------61:03----------
sense with regards to boot sequence not

---------61:04----------
completing

---------61:29----------
No

---------61:33----------
man

---------62:51----------
if they think

---------62:55----------
hand pump them down down down something

---------63:00----------
done

---------63:05----------
and contagion down and down and until

---------63:09----------
then turned down Jonathan Duncan daring

---------63:13----------
and the data tenet and epic battle

---------63:20----------
[Music]

---------63:28----------
[Music]

---------63:35----------
[Music]

---------63:50----------
might as well do kill two birds with one

---------63:52----------
stone let's go over that is all six two

---------63:56----------
five nine and we're moving

---------64:22----------
that was a Sanford and Son truck that I

---------64:26----------
was humming

---------64:28----------
[Music]

---------64:40----------
there that's too much solder on the

---------64:43----------
center pad even from my silliness

---------65:00----------
very good

---------65:50----------
this tip really sucks this micro pencil

---------65:53----------
tip is not working and I use tip cleaner

---------65:55----------
on it too like it look it's repelling

---------65:58----------
solder this is awful

---------66:02----------
watch see I'm gonna clean the tip it's

---------66:05----------
gonna have nothing on it there we go

---------66:19----------
my solder refuses to stick to it its

---------66:22----------
aggravate

---------66:27----------
fine I'll use Maine tip even though this

---------66:29----------
is clearly not meant for this

---------66:31----------
[Music]

---------67:00----------
[Music]

---------67:13----------
rapid cool technology

---------67:48----------
pp bus is still low

---------68:05----------
I know that ping could be soldered nicer

---------68:07----------
but that's not what's causing it see

---------68:10----------
data line is why use my SMC data line

---------68:15----------
stuck at point one volts what the [ __ ]

---------68:19----------
and you're gonna see you're not shorted

---------68:21----------
to ground but you're stuck at point one

---------68:22----------
volts really now point one yeah it's

---------68:27----------
[ __ ] up point one okay

---------68:32----------
hi the SMC is bad at the pull ups are

---------68:34----------
shorted my guess is that the SMC is bad

---------68:37----------
because the data line there is stuck at

---------68:41----------
point one for both of them not one so

---------68:44----------
let's see if there's anything that those

---------68:45----------
two data lines have in common let's see

---------68:53----------
what are those two data lines have in

---------68:55----------
common because that's a three point 42

---------68:58----------
volt data line right here alright see

---------68:59----------
this SMC

---------69:12----------
and say it's got some flux in my mouth

---------69:14----------
it's cleaned it off alright so see this

---------69:16----------
this is a three-point 42 volt data line

---------69:18----------
I'll show you how we know so if we

---------69:21----------
search through the schematic using the

---------69:24----------
Paul effing Daniels software pp 3 before

---------69:28----------
to wonder squared g3 hot is pulling this

---------69:31----------
up the three point four so I should see

---------69:33----------
pulsing at the very least even if it's

---------69:35----------
not three point four because it's gonna

---------69:36----------
be talking it should be one point five

---------69:37----------
one point eight or going back and forth

---------69:39----------
between three point four and zero and

---------69:41----------
it's not doing that it's just stuck you

---------69:43----------
know we have to do is we have to see

---------69:45----------
where else this data line shows up so

---------69:47----------
let's see so that data line is gonna go

---------69:50----------
to a diode called D 70/50 which I I

---------69:54----------
replaced this [ __ ]

---------69:56----------
I saw that diode properly that's one

---------69:59----------
thing to check out all right that board

---------70:01----------
has actually damaged over there so we

---------70:04----------
have this resistor that's a pull-up

---------70:06----------
resistor what if that's not making its

---------70:09----------
way through our 5380 and our 5380 one

---------70:13----------
now let's see what they are up here I

---------70:15----------
have a feeling actually that are fifty

---------70:17----------
three eighty and are 53 eighty one these

---------70:19----------
this resistor and that resistor I bet

---------70:23----------
that I'm actually getting three point 42

---------70:25----------
volts if I measure on those resistors up

---------70:27----------
there but it's not making its way to the

---------70:29----------
other side of the machine then I think

---------70:31----------
that we may actually have some issues

---------70:33----------
where there are traces inside the board

---------70:36----------
that are broken let's see if that's

---------70:39----------
what's going on here yep 3.43 up here

---------70:48----------
3.43 up here but then we go to the ISL

---------70:52----------
six two five nine where that's supposed

---------70:53----------
to be community communicating we get

---------71:00----------
0.15 in 0.15 so this board actually has

---------71:05----------
some issues inside of it yeah this board

---------71:12----------
actually has stuff broken on the inside

---------71:13----------
of it and now let's see that is it at

---------71:16----------
the diode where this is happening

---------71:18----------
because the thing is that brain deadness

---------71:19----------
of the board may actually be something

---------71:22----------
that's unfixable because if there's

---------71:23----------
points going in between the board that

---------71:26----------
are not that are not attached for this

---------71:30----------
it may be much worse so our issue is

---------71:33----------
that this this was just a red herring

---------71:36----------
here it was that pp bus g3 how is 12

---------71:40----------
point to 23 volts instead of 12 point 56

---------71:42----------
that's this chip up here this chip the

---------71:45----------
battery charger needs to communicate

---------71:46----------
with the SMC before this chip the

---------71:48----------
battery charger creates 12 point 56

---------71:50----------
volts rather than 12 point 23 and this

---------71:52----------
data line over here that speaks with it

---------71:54----------
it's again it's 0.1 volts over there but

---------71:58----------
it's 3.42 volts over here so now the

---------72:02----------
middle section is where everything was

---------72:03----------
corroded to [ __ ] right well let's see

---------72:07----------
what we're getting over there in the

---------72:08----------
middle section so these are the two SMC

---------72:11----------
data lines parts you know 3.43 here

---------72:22----------
okay we get 3.43 here in 0.15 here

---------72:35----------
and here we go look at that look at that

---------72:38----------
look at that look at that look at that

---------72:39----------
we got broken probe poins broken probe

---------72:42----------
points all right now there may be broken

---------72:43----------
probe points that I missed by the memory

---------72:46----------
so first let's get this thing back to 12

---------72:48----------
point 56 volts I'm gonna just grab my

---------72:50----------
x-acto knife blade over here look at

---------72:53----------
that see that that was a that was a good

---------72:56----------
one yeah see that I'm just gonna

---------72:59----------
reattach these two points and then I'm

---------73:02----------
gonna go hunting because I bet if I look

---------73:05----------
really closely there's more probe points

---------73:07----------
related to the memory over here that are

---------73:09----------
not soldered on okay

---------73:13----------
so first let's clean that this is a fun

---------73:16----------
find Tim I just reflow the smc like an

---------73:21----------
idiot but granted the reason that I

---------73:24----------
reflow the SMC to defend my thinking is

---------73:26----------
it wasn't simply a pee pee bus issue

---------73:28----------
where the data line wasn't working we

---------73:30----------
also have an issue with booting where it

---------73:33----------
has no brain and the SMC is a part of

---------73:35----------
that boot sequence which is why I had

---------73:36----------
concerns for it but admit that didn't

---------73:38----------
wind up being the issue so you know

---------73:40----------
either way let's reattach these two just

---------73:44----------
so that we have at least that part will

---------73:47----------
be properly done so this way the machine

---------73:49----------
will at least be able to see a battery

---------73:50----------
as it sits there brain-dead it's really

---------73:52----------
important that your brain-dead machine

---------73:54----------
be able to turn on with a battery

---------74:04----------
all right we're just gonna redo these

---------74:06----------
traces scraped a little put some solder

---------74:10----------
on them after that makes all the

---------74:13----------
Europeans and Australians watching happy

---------74:14----------
I said solder and do this

---------74:24----------
see you attach a wire

---------75:23----------
I'm winning you guys intuition YouTube

---------75:26----------
chat to help me find the pro point that

---------75:28----------
I missed because there's gonna be a

---------75:30----------
probe point around here that's dead

---------75:32----------
related to the memory and that or that's

---------75:34----------
gonna be why it's not booting it's gonna

---------75:37----------
be some probe point around here that's

---------75:38----------
also corroded and I'm gonna need a lot

---------75:42----------
of help from all of you and finding it

---------75:45----------
is once I find that this machine won't

---------75:47----------
be brain dead anymore

---------75:51----------
but it's somewhere down here

---------76:26----------
you

---------76:29----------
is it you

---------76:36----------
let's see if we at least fixed our

---------76:38----------
twelve point twenty three volts problem

---------76:41----------
right now when I turn it on I should be

---------76:43----------
getting twelve point 56 volts

---------76:59----------
12.20 for very interesting actually

---------77:10----------
1.55

---------77:14----------
3.43 1.35 okay what the [ __ ] is up with

---------77:19----------
that

---------77:22----------
let's go back up here

---------77:26----------
three point four three three point four

---------77:30----------
three okay WT [ __ ] [ __ ] those are

---------77:37----------
literally reattached wires okay is it

---------77:39----------
over here or it's not fully going

---------77:41----------
through

---------77:51----------
one point for

---------77:53----------
three-point-three okay wait so there's

---------77:57----------
something being lost between here and

---------77:58----------
the SMC so that line over to that

---------78:05----------
resistor Wow

---------78:08----------
so this burns inside the board here it

---------78:10----------
that burn is not just in that wire

---------78:13----------
that's actually a burn inside the board

---------78:17----------
so this point over here is disconnected

---------78:20----------
so at first the points between the wire

---------78:23----------
between here and here like this probe

---------78:26----------
point would disconnected these two Pro

---------78:28----------
points is connected however it's not

---------78:30----------
just that that from the diode all the

---------78:33----------
way over here is disconnected so that's

---------78:34----------
going to have to be reconnected with a

---------78:36----------
wire

---------80:13----------
jeez

---------80:19----------
okay

---------80:38----------
12.50 six time now here's the part

---------80:41----------
that's really [ __ ] up

---------80:42----------
that was a tres that did not actually

---------80:45----------
have any damage between the diode and

---------80:48----------
the SMC so what that means is that this

---------80:50----------
board is so far damaged that there are

---------80:52----------
traces inside of the actual motherboard

---------80:55----------
that I can't see that are broken now

---------80:58----------
this is actually where having the money

---------81:00----------
for something like a Norton 3d x-ray

---------81:02----------
machine would come in handy because I

---------81:04----------
can use my brain to some extent to give

---------81:07----------
you an idea of where the problem is so I

---------81:10----------
didn't need to even see that that trace

---------81:12----------
was broken in order to know that it

---------81:14----------
wasn't communicating even though I

---------81:16----------
didn't have a short and I had three

---------81:18----------
point 42 volts in the data line by the

---------81:19----------
SMC I knew to check for it over there

---------81:22----------
because I understood how the circuit

---------81:24----------
worked but when we start getting into

---------81:26----------
why the machine is brain dead that's far

---------81:29----------
too open-ended it's not a very simple

---------81:31----------
this little thing talks to that little

---------81:32----------
thing kind of problem and in Norton 3d

---------81:35----------
x-ray machine would actually be able to

---------81:36----------
show me inside of the board what is

---------81:39----------
broken so that I could fix it so think

---------81:41----------
of it kind of like a neural link and

---------81:42----------
Norton 3dx marish even 3d x-ray machine

---------81:45----------
would be kind of like my brain but on

---------81:49----------
steroids

---------81:49----------
the problem is that machines about

---------81:51----------
120,000 bucks and I have failed so badly

---------81:55----------
in business and in life that I can

---------81:57----------
barely even afford to move into a new

---------81:59----------
store with even floors to the point

---------82:01----------
where my air conditioner is gonna you

---------82:04----------
know there's gonna be an air conditioner

---------82:05----------
that's on a fox wall that doesn't even

---------82:08----------
not even there anymore because I suck so

---------82:12----------
unfortunately that is out of the budget

---------82:13----------
but this is one of the reasons that I

---------82:16----------
stay at work wait this is one of the

---------82:17----------
reasons that I think about how can my

---------82:19----------
business expand what new services can I

---------82:22----------
offer this is why it's really exciting

---------82:24----------
to not just do normal data recovery but

---------82:26----------
also heads swap level data recovery

---------82:29----------
doing videos on it more marketing or

---------82:31----------
advertising because if I was actually on

---------82:33----------
my game and if I was a real business

---------82:35----------
owner like a real business owner not a

---------82:37----------
fake ass business owner I would be able

---------82:39----------
to go oh that's something that could

---------82:40----------
help my business oh my business based on

---------82:43----------
boarder pair and that machine would take

---------82:44----------
us to the next level let's just grab it

---------82:46----------
but I'm not so when people think you

---------82:48----------
know you deserve to take a vacation you

---------82:50----------
deserve time

---------82:51----------
if you earn this that and the other I

---------82:53----------
haven't I haven't really earned jack

---------82:55----------
[ __ ] I've actually quite underperformed

---------82:58----------
given that there are companies like

---------82:59----------
asset Gini or you know several other

---------83:02----------
companies out there that exist that if

---------83:03----------
they wanted something like that they

---------83:05----------
just you know pick up the phone and have

---------83:06----------
the resources to be able to get it

---------83:09----------
because I can't even get a loan to

---------83:11----------
[ __ ] renovate a store I'm moving into

---------83:13----------
after 11 years but it's it's important

---------83:17----------
to be honest with yourself about where

---------83:19----------
you are you know I try not to beat

---------83:20----------
myself up I don't beat myself up

---------83:22----------
I don't like sit in a room all sad and

---------83:24----------
depressed all day but I'm not going to

---------83:27----------
lie to myself and tell myself that I'm

---------83:30----------
more things that I'm not worth that I've

---------83:31----------
earned things that I haven't earned or

---------83:34----------
that I'm good at something when I'm

---------83:36----------
actually or when I have failed in some

---------83:39----------
respects because it would be really cool

---------83:41----------
to just put this thing in there and have

---------83:42----------
a known good eight to zero - zero zero

---------83:45----------
four to six and this one and just have

---------83:47----------
it literally pop up and show all the

---------83:49----------
bond wires and then we can overlay it

---------83:51----------
see what the differences are between the

---------83:52----------
two and then just run the single jumper

---------83:54----------
wire that's necessary to make this work

---------83:56----------
again and there's a lot of jumper wires

---------83:58----------
that you can figure out by using your

---------83:59----------
brain but there's that last five to ten

---------84:01----------
percent that you can't do that the

---------84:02----------
machine probably could whoa

---------84:07----------
five volts on screen five volts on

---------84:10----------
screen [ __ ] Dodson ah who needs a

---------84:16----------
neuro-link [ __ ]

---------84:18----------
oh-ho question mark folder question mark

---------84:22----------
that is awesome

---------84:24----------
suck my dick Norton 3d x-ray machine man

---------84:30----------
I actually kind of felt sorry for myself

---------84:31----------
there a little bit I actually felt a

---------84:34----------
little bit sorry for myself like you

---------84:36----------
know 11 years in business and I'm such a

---------84:38----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] up that I can't buy one

---------84:42----------
[ __ ] tool that would help my business

---------84:44----------
and make life easier for everybody here

---------84:47----------
take us to the next level allow us to

---------84:49----------
learn more allow us to do more

---------84:50----------
educational videos because if we can

---------84:52----------
actually figure out the trace if we

---------84:53----------
could figure out the ones that we're not

---------84:55----------
able to now we would actually be able to

---------84:57----------
learn something like oh when you have

---------84:58----------
this problem it's that trace and then we

---------85:00----------
can figure out why and then we could

---------85:01----------
really reverse engineer around it

---------85:03----------
I don't need that cuz I got my [ __ ]

---------85:05----------
brain yeah [ __ ] you Chase Bank I don't

---------85:10----------
need your [ __ ] money to open my new

---------85:11----------
store

---------85:12----------
suck my dick yeah this is awesome oh I

---------85:16----------
don't need no goddamn bank loan I got a

---------85:19----------
question mark folder it only took me

---------85:22----------
four hours and 47 minutes fix a computer

---------85:26----------
that's four years old but still

---------85:27----------
accomplishment oh I'm gonna look back on

---------85:31----------
this dream and I'm gonna be very

---------85:33----------
aggravated that I ever did it but

---------85:34----------
there's one other thing I want to check

---------85:36----------
now that I know it works

---------85:37----------
what is DD uh what is that vtt voltage

---------85:40----------
supposed to be is three is it supposed

---------85:41----------
to be six volts is the schematic wrong

---------85:43----------
let's see okay what do we got here okay

---------85:46----------
can I measure on the top of the board I

---------85:47----------
got x-ray vision with my [ __ ]

---------85:50----------
eyeballs

---------85:51----------
that's such I don't need no x-ray

---------85:54----------
machine I don't know but that just gave

---------85:56----------
me a jolt oh that feels good don't mean

---------86:00----------
rush we're figuring out a [ __ ] up

---------86:03----------
board like this yeah what the [ __ ]

---------86:06----------
it's supposed to be 0.34 volts [ __ ] you

---------86:09----------
Apple oh that is so [ __ ] up I was

---------86:12----------
chasing that issue for like 30 [ __ ]

---------86:14----------
minutes because the shitty documentation

---------86:16----------
here it's 0.34 volts but when you look

---------86:20----------
on the schematic the schematic clearly

---------86:23----------
states on the power aliases page that

---------86:27----------
that is supposed to be 0.67 5 volts 0.67

---------86:34----------
5 volts and it's 0.35 volts and it works

---------86:37----------
why why does your documentation have to

---------86:40----------
suck oh it's just like these new

---------86:46----------
machines where it says oh my god this is

---------86:49----------
annoying this is so aggravating it's

---------86:51----------
like when it says 18 volts input where

---------86:53----------
it's supposed to be 12 or 8 this is like

---------86:55----------
where they say is l6 2 5 9 and the new

---------86:57----------
machines when it supposed to be is l9 2

---------86:59----------
3 9 or is all 9 2 4 0 like that is I

---------87:03----------
wasted a half and [ __ ] our teeth to

---------87:05----------
2:30 in the morning because of Apple

---------87:07----------
[ __ ] documentation why is right to

---------87:10----------
repair or even argue why are we even

---------87:12----------
advocating to get access to these

---------87:14----------
originals come

---------87:16----------
they suck somebody else should write up

---------87:18----------
a proper one they don't even know what

---------87:21----------
voltage their own [ __ ] power rails

---------87:22----------
are in this are you kidding me are you

---------87:25----------
kidding me oh this board for your

---------87:29----------
software is kidding me - this is drunk

---------87:31----------
Paul Daniel software opening up in this

---------87:33----------
funky orientation hey look at this look

---------87:38----------
at this look at this dumbass [ __ ] this

---------87:40----------
is the board view in schematic front is

---------87:42----------
eight to zero zero zero two three nine

---------87:44----------
do we still use it is so six to five no

---------87:48----------
I mean you don't you use ISO nine to

---------87:51----------
thirty nine correct your [ __ ] data

---------87:53----------
sheets Oh lay this Liz ISL six two five

---------87:57----------
nine you click to the next page it says

---------88:00----------
iso nine two three nine but you click

---------88:02----------
back over there and this is iso six two

---------88:04----------
five nine but you click here and this is

---------88:05----------
iso nine two three nine media click

---------88:07----------
there inside so if I survive my MIDI

---------88:08----------
click here inside seven why you lazy ass

---------88:11----------
Apple engineers document your [ __ ]

---------88:14----------
machines properly so that I can go home

---------88:16----------
in time I feel good I felt good though I
