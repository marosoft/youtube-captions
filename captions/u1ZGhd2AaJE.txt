---------00:00----------
today I'm going to go over the most

---------00:00----------
simple no backlight problem which is

---------00:02----------
backlight fuse so when I go over here

---------00:05----------
what do you think is going to be wrong

---------00:07----------
with the sport this is one of the very

---------00:10----------
very very very very very very few rare

---------00:12----------
times you'll see the backlight fuse

---------00:13----------
actually blowing in air usually what

---------00:15----------
happens is the the LCD connector boils

---------00:21----------
and then the feedback ball under the lp

---------00:23----------
8550 blows and you have an entire

---------00:25----------
complete mess because the

---------00:28----------
little fuse that's supposed to prevent

---------00:29----------
all that from happening doesn't blow but

---------00:32----------
on this one it actually did which is

---------00:33----------
rich is really really cool

---------00:34----------
it had the consideration to actually do

---------00:36----------
it it's supposed to and designed to do

---------00:38----------
so I'm going to take my hot air station

---------00:45----------
here

---------00:55----------
wait for it to get hot that is a much

---------00:59----------
better image than what I used to have I

---------01:00----------
have to say

---------01:18----------
come on Jaco

---------01:23----------
oh you can do it there you go

---------01:27----------
it's nasty looking at it

---------02:06----------
the flux is going to carry away in the

---------02:09----------
side or all the junk the heat also helps

---------02:13----------
you kind of got the liquidus solder

---------02:15----------
that's boiling that's melting and the

---------02:18----------
flux carrying away all the crap into

---------02:19----------
that big ball

---------02:40----------
this is so embarrassing I don't have a

---------02:44----------
backlight fuse Oh My Jesus okay don't

---------02:53----------
tell anybody because that's embarrassing

---------02:55----------
if people found out we were just going

---------02:59----------
to take it off of a dead board

---------03:12----------
that's just sad yeah but really it blows

---------03:16----------
so little on newer machines because like

---------03:19----------
the backlight fuses not the fuse the LCD

---------03:21----------
connectors the fuse in the

---------03:24----------
feedback via

---------03:42----------
okay so I'm not used to having a working

---------03:43----------
hot air station so I have the air little

---------03:45----------
set-to hi

---------03:46----------
let's uses God and then this in the

---------03:48----------
sixth dimension with all the other fuses

---------03:50----------
little things that I've knocked off of a

---------03:52----------
board

---------04:22----------
you know this is supposed to be the

---------04:24----------
simplest repair to do like the easiest I

---------04:27----------
mean the simplest thing to do on an

---------04:30----------
Apple motherboard esup listening to on

---------04:32----------
any motherboard and I just it up

---------04:34----------
on camera twice in a row I don't know

---------04:37----------
how I feel about that

---------04:48----------
like not only did I it up by not

---------04:49----------
having the most basic fundamental

---------04:50----------
building block to the motherboard in

---------04:52----------
stock but then I it up by

---------04:54----------
actually blowing it away

---------05:00----------
and I'm still probably going to wind up

---------05:02----------
posting it oh and then I it up by

---------05:06----------
not having it soldered on camera what a

---------05:08----------
video

---------05:36----------
now we do as you make sure that there's

---------05:38----------
no short to ground because there's no

---------05:40----------
point in replacing the fuse if a short

---------05:42----------
to ground is present that would cause it

---------05:43----------
as blow again that would be just a sad

---------05:45----------
waste of time so I put the multimeter

---------05:47----------
and diode mode

---------05:48----------
I take pin I take the black probe a

---------05:53----------
place that where back light output is

---------05:55----------
I'm going to take the red probe I'm

---------05:56----------
going to put it on ground and I get a

---------05:59----------
number of 0.5 30 which is perfectly

---------06:03----------
acceptable for this board when I

---------06:05----------
reassemble it probably gonna have a

---------06:07----------
backlight pretty sure look good news

---------06:11----------
ma'am we fixed your board see the

---------06:15----------
backlight but oh it's cracked this is

---------06:20----------
what we call time for an unpleasant

---------06:22----------
sales call oh boy yeah this is what

---------06:28----------
having a full time salesman is for

---------06:30----------
because that is a 15 minute conversation

---------06:33----------
that I don't feel like having right now

---------06:35----------
on to the next one
