---------00:00----------
all right today we're gonna be working

---------00:02----------
on yet another MacBook this MacBook over

---------00:05----------
here has a Bitcoin sticker on it this

---------00:12----------
MacBook has a Bitcoin sticker I imagine

---------00:15----------
he did not sell one was worth $19,000 a

---------00:18----------
Bitcoin because this is an h1 78 and

---------00:20----------
they're getting it fixed in 2019 let's

---------00:24----------
take a look inside this MacBook and see

---------00:25----------
what's going on with it here we have an

---------00:27----------
8 to 0 dash 2936 MacBook this is a 2011

---------00:30----------
MacBook Pro that this a 2-0 2936 is out

---------00:34----------
of the machine we are going to plug it

---------00:36----------
into the charger and see what it does

---------00:40----------
now this is taking 200 milliamps and not

---------00:43----------
turning on typically in a 2-0 2936

---------00:46----------
should be taking five to seven hundred

---------00:49----------
milliamps when turning on it's going to

---------00:51----------
take 20 to 30 milliamps when p.m. sleep

---------00:53----------
s4l is missing it's going to take a

---------00:55----------
hundred 250 milliamps when every rail is

---------00:58----------
turning on besides CPU vcore because all

---------01:00----------
says power good is missing 200 milliamps

---------01:02----------
typically means a short circuit to

---------01:04----------
ground on PP bus g3 hot let's see if

---------01:06----------
that's the case on this 8 to 0 29:36 so

---------01:10----------
I am going to open up a schematic and a

---------01:14----------
board view so we're gonna go through our

---------01:15----------
power rails in this machine and see

---------01:18----------
what's going on power rails on the older

---------01:20----------
Prix 2013 machines are going to be on

---------01:23----------
page 7 on this power aliases page we get

---------01:26----------
a light on the charger and since we have

---------01:28----------
a light on the charger most likely PP 3

---------01:32----------
V 4 2 is present and I do not have to

---------01:34----------
waste my time measuring it so what I'm

---------01:37----------
gonna do is I'm gonna check my PP bus PP

---------01:41----------
bus appears to be 0 volts on this

---------01:43----------
macbook 0 volts here actually nevermind

---------01:48----------
I didn't have my multimeter on ground my

---------01:51----------
bad bro 12 point 6 volts but not turning

---------01:54----------
on ok so next up we're going to check

---------01:57----------
some of the other rails here let's take

---------01:59----------
a look at PPV RTC now you may wonder

---------02:03----------
Louis you just skipped over a whole

---------02:05----------
bunch of rails what's up with that

---------02:06----------
well PP 3 V 4 2 is the rail that's

---------02:09----------
required in order to power the SMC and

---------02:12----------
the chips around

---------02:13----------
smc that allow us to talk to the charger

---------02:15----------
so I have a green light in my charger

---------02:17----------
the green light my charger means that

---------02:19----------
the SMC chip which is powered by PP 54 -

---------02:21----------
is working and if that is working to

---------02:23----------
some extent that means that this rail is

---------02:26----------
working which means I don't have to

---------02:27----------
check it now I didn't check pp DC it

---------02:31----------
this is the DC impound if this is if I

---------02:36----------
have a light that means that P P 3 V 4 2

---------02:38----------
is present if PP 3 before 2 is present

---------02:40----------
then obviously the voltage coming from

---------02:41----------
the DC n board is present so for

---------02:45----------
instance let's say I'm having an issue

---------02:47----------
where one device in my office like my

---------02:49----------
microscope camera doesn't work I'm not

---------02:51----------
going to bother checking the voltage at

---------02:53----------
my breaker box

---------02:54----------
if one item doesn't work because if my

---------02:56----------
breaker box were broken

---------02:58----------
if one then everything else that was on

---------03:00----------
this circuit would also be off like my

---------03:02----------
monitor and my lighting but since all

---------03:04----------
that stuff is on I know the breaker box

---------03:05----------
is good so I'm not going to go that far

---------03:07----------
up the chain this is simply a sub rail

---------03:10----------
of pp bus g3 hot just gotta check your

---------03:14----------
because it's never missing unless

---------03:16----------
somebody purposely removed a resistor

---------03:18----------
connecting to there's a current sense

---------03:20----------
resistor connecting these two that is

---------03:22----------
almost impossible to corrode and the

---------03:25----------
only way that's missing is if some

---------03:26----------
jackass removed it which doesn't look

---------03:28----------
like a case on this board next up we're

---------03:30----------
going to go for PPV RTC underscore g3

---------03:32----------
hot this rail is going to be there I'm

---------03:34----------
gonna tell you how I know this rail is

---------03:36----------
going to be there later on but first

---------03:38----------
things first

---------03:39----------
we're going to see if it's present on

---------03:41----------
this board and also I'm going to use

---------03:43----------
this as an opportunity to just brag

---------03:45----------
about my new toy lens this is a $500

---------03:48----------
lens and it does a lot of zooming and it

---------03:51----------
is sexy isn't it I know I don't even

---------03:54----------
have to use the microscope sometimes if

---------03:56----------
I don't want to because I have this

---------03:59----------
lovely LEDs now

---------04:04----------
pp 3 V 3 4 PP v RTC g3 hot is present

---------04:09----------
now how do I know that was present

---------04:11----------
before I even measured it great question

---------04:13----------
when I decide that I'm going to plug the

---------04:16----------
power supply in and healthy and figure

---------04:18----------
out what the amperage of the board is

---------04:20----------
what amperage the board is drawing

---------04:22----------
before I start what I'm doing is I'm

---------04:24----------
ruling out a set of problems now P P

---------04:27----------
bust g3 hot being short it's a ground or

---------04:29----------
a higher level rail being shorted to

---------04:31----------
ground is typically the cause of a two

---------04:32----------
hundred mill amp amp amperage draw from

---------04:34----------
this machine when I'm missing PPV RTC on

---------04:37----------
g3 hot I'm also going to be missing p.m.

---------04:40----------
sleep s4l and everything else and that

---------04:42----------
it typically means a 20 to 30 mil hem

---------04:45----------
draw my power supply here says that at

---------04:47----------
18 volts I'm drawing 2200 milliamps

---------04:49----------
which means that that's most likely not

---------04:51----------
the case this is why it's really

---------04:52----------
important to make measurements for every

---------04:54----------
one of these boards that you work on so

---------04:56----------
that you could become more efficient

---------04:57----------
over time every time you solve a

---------04:59----------
specific problem on the board you're

---------05:01----------
going to write down here is what I did

---------05:03----------
here was the problem here is the amount

---------05:05----------
of amperage uu is taking when I started

---------05:07----------
and eventually if you're good at pattern

---------05:09----------
recognition or have a half-decent memory

---------05:11----------
you those ought to start automatically

---------05:13----------
clicking to the point where you plug it

---------05:15----------
in and the moment you plug it in and you

---------05:16----------
look at that and you just take a look at

---------05:18----------
the board and make a few one or two

---------05:19----------
measurements you know what's going on

---------05:21----------
with it

---------05:21----------
and you can even get good enough at it

---------05:22----------
if you really write down everything and

---------05:24----------
you dig into what it is you're doing you

---------05:26----------
can get good enough at the pattern

---------05:28----------
recognition to the point where you just

---------05:29----------
look at the power supply and half of the

---------05:31----------
time you know what's wrong with that

---------05:32----------
particular model board it's going to

---------05:34----------
save you time and in this business

---------05:35----------
saving time means making more money

---------05:38----------
retaining your sanity and having happier

---------05:40----------
customers and having happier customers

---------05:42----------
is a great thing now we're gonna take a

---------05:45----------
look and see what other where else may

---------05:47----------
be missing so let's scroll up a little

---------05:49----------
bit over here and let's check pp5 es5

---------05:52----------
i'll do that in the microscope this time

---------05:54----------
i will stop being lazy and pp5 es5 can

---------05:57----------
be found right over here 5 volts ok next

---------06:07----------
rail we're going to check for PP 5 vs 3

---------06:10----------
PP 5 es 3 is going to show up on these

---------06:12----------
capacitors over here let's see what we

---------06:19----------
have on the capacitor

---------06:29----------
okay

---------06:30----------
when we try to measure the capacitor it

---------06:33----------
looks like we have zero volts on that

---------06:36----------
line now I have a PowerPoint

---------06:39----------
presentation that I aggravated in libra

---------06:42----------
office so I guess Libre Office

---------06:43----------
presentation but PowerPoint sounds

---------06:45----------
cooler

---------06:46----------
Microsoft is really good at branding

---------06:48----------
that's why I think they do well with

---------06:49----------
stuff Linux has a terminal Microsoft has

---------06:52----------
PowerShell it's like it's fits for the

---------06:56----------
you know the Alex Jones's of the world

---------06:58----------
PowerShell PowerPoint or anyway I had a

---------07:06----------
PowerPoint presentation that gives you

---------07:08----------
an idea of how it is you troubleshoot

---------07:10----------
certain issues on certain rails I mean a

---------07:13----------
certain issues in machine repairing

---------07:14----------
using data and logic love it doing

---------07:16----------
myself everyday in the automotive world

---------07:17----------
awesome Jay I hope you enjoy the

---------07:21----------
detective work that's what makes the job

---------07:22----------
fun so what I have here is a document

---------07:28----------
that's gonna show you how it is you find

---------07:31----------
the power rails that are missing and all

---------07:32----------
this kind of good stuff and how you

---------07:34----------
troubleshoot and learn how to do this

---------07:35----------
the way I do and it's a beginner's guide

---------07:38----------
that is in my links down below and I

---------07:43----------
will show you it on screen here for just

---------07:45----------
a moment just a moment just one moment

---------07:51----------
BAM

---------07:52----------
and one and on the power rails page I

---------07:56----------
tell you how it is that you should go

---------07:59----------
about figuring out why a power rail is

---------08:01----------
missing so if a power rails missing a

---------08:03----------
couple of things are possible the first

---------08:04----------
is that it's not being told to turn on

---------08:06----------
so here I have my uh my microphone this

---------08:12----------
is from my transmitter

---------08:23----------
moment because you are not able to hear

---------08:26----------
me for that moment because I told my

---------08:27----------
smartphone to not turn on it wasn't an

---------08:29----------
issue of power it wasn't an issue of a

---------08:31----------
broken mic transmitter it was an issue

---------08:35----------
of I was not telling it to turn on you

---------08:37----------
also have no power issues so even if it

---------08:40----------
is being told to turn on it be a short

---------08:50----------
circuit to ground so let's see which of

---------08:52----------
these is going to be true for this model

---------08:55----------
board so the first thing we're going to

---------08:57----------
do is figure out where PP 5 vs 3 is

---------09:00----------
created so let's see how it is we would

---------09:02----------
go about finding out where PP 5 es 3 is

---------09:05----------
created so I'm going to right click on

---------09:07----------
that bring out my board view and I'm

---------09:10----------
gonna keep clicking on PP 5 es 3 until I

---------09:13----------
find a page that looks like the page

---------09:14----------
that's responsible for making it many of

---------09:17----------
my students in the past had lots of

---------09:18----------
problems telling the difference between

---------09:20----------
where power was going in to something

---------09:21----------
and when it was coming out of something

---------09:23----------
so for instance here is my microscope

---------09:26----------
camera I have power going into it here

---------09:29----------
so this is where the voltage is going

---------09:30----------
into my camera but this is not where the

---------09:32----------
voltage is created the voltage from my

---------09:35----------
camera is created at that wall Ward

---------09:37----------
power adapter something that looks like

---------09:38----------
this that is under my desk so this is

---------09:41----------
where the power is being created and

---------09:43----------
then this is going to be plugged into

---------09:45----------
something where it's going into that so

---------09:47----------
let's just plug this back in and I'm

---------09:49----------
going to show you the difference between

---------09:50----------
those two things since it happens to

---------09:52----------
really confuse a lot of people that I've

---------09:53----------
had here for training so if we click PP

---------09:56----------
5 es 3 I'm going to show you some

---------09:57----------
examples and we're gonna go over how it

---------09:59----------
is you can tell those things apart

---------10:01----------
this is pp 5 es 3 but this is pp 5 es 3

---------10:04----------
going into a transistor PP 5 es 3 is

---------10:07----------
pulling up a signal with this 100 kilo

---------10:11----------
ohm resistor PP 5 es 3 is pulling up

---------10:13----------
memory set isil LS 5 v l PP 5 es 3 in

---------10:18----------
this scenario is not being created here

---------10:20----------
that's not that's not what we're looking

---------10:22----------
for so we're just gonna click again here

---------10:24----------
PP 5 es 3 is going into the webcam

---------10:28----------
connector to power the camera and the

---------10:30----------
automated light sensor that's what ALS

---------10:32----------
stands for here

---------10:35----------
over here we have PP 5 vs 3 going into

---------10:38----------
the hard drive connector so that is not

---------10:43----------
it that's where it's gonna be powering

---------10:44----------
the hard drive here that's the optical

---------10:48----------
disc drive power here we have PP 5 vs 3

---------10:51----------
going into ahem into a USB power chip so

---------10:56----------
this is what's going to power the USB

---------10:58----------
items that you plug into the machine cpp

---------11:00----------
fabulous leaders going into that so

---------11:02----------
that's not what we're looking we're just

---------11:03----------
gonna keep scrolling through this until

---------11:06----------
we find out where it's being created

---------11:08----------
same thing is true here this is it going

---------11:11----------
into the chip that powers that little

---------11:12----------
infrared remote that Apple II used to

---------11:14----------
use in the front of the machines not it

---------11:16----------
this is it going into a sleep circuit we

---------11:19----------
want to figure out where what chip PP 5

---------11:22----------
vs 3 comes out of what creates it this

---------11:25----------
is it going into an audio supply into an

---------11:28----------
audio chip into an audio chip into

---------11:31----------
another audio chip of some sort I

---------11:32----------
imagine and we just continue and this is

---------11:37----------
if going into a FET that's then going to

---------11:39----------
be creating another rail PP 5 ESO so

---------11:43----------
let's continue scrolling so here PP 5 es

---------11:47----------
3 is coming out of a chip called TPS 5

---------11:49----------
on 1 2 5 so let's find TPS 5 1 2 5 now

---------11:53----------
shall we alright

---------11:56----------
TPS 5 or 1 to 5 just gonna be used 7200

---------12:01----------
you're right hmm so here PP 5 es 3 look

---------12:10----------
I found it PP v es 3 now this is coming

---------12:16----------
out of here so this is about converter

---------12:19----------
this chip is telling those 2 transistors

---------12:21----------
went to switch and they're gonna turn

---------12:23----------
the 12 volts that are coming in to them

---------12:25----------
via pp bus as 5 into 5 volts out of it

---------12:28----------
and it's over here 5 volt 3.3 volt power

---------12:31----------
supply so let's take a look at where

---------12:37----------
people how this is created and what's

---------12:39----------
going to tell it to turn on now if you

---------12:41----------
take a look and trip 1 is most likely

---------12:44----------
going to be what turns on this chip so

---------12:46----------
if we were to select TPS 5 1 2

---------12:49----------
five what I'm looking for is an enable

---------12:51----------
pin here we go end trip connect to

---------12:54----------
resistor from this pin to ground set

---------12:56----------
threshold first set short to ground to

---------12:58----------
shut down a switcher channel okay so a

---------13:00----------
lot of chips what they do is they have

---------13:02----------
what's called an enable pin so you send

---------13:04----------
voltage to the enable pin and then it

---------13:06----------
turns itself on similar to how turning a

---------13:08----------
light switch depends the light switch on

---------13:10----------
sending three volts the enable pin will

---------13:11----------
turn it on and trip pins are typically

---------13:13----------
the opposite of enable pins and enabled

---------13:15----------
in a device with an enable pin is going

---------13:18----------
to be off unless you tell it to turn on

---------13:21----------
a device with an end trip pin is going

---------13:23----------
to be on unless you tell it to turn off

---------13:26----------
that's the difference so with this

---------13:29----------
device the way it works is you have to

---------13:32----------
turn it off it's going to automatically

---------13:34----------
be on all the time

---------13:35----------
so let's see how it is they managed to

---------13:37----------
do that in this schematic so if we take

---------13:39----------
a look n trip for Pete Val rail that's

---------13:42----------
missing so this over here gets tied to

---------13:45----------
ground through this transistor so this

---------13:48----------
chip is always going to have its enable

---------13:49----------
there it's always going to be wanting to

---------13:51----------
turn on but this transistor over here is

---------13:53----------
going to short that to ground to shut

---------13:55----------
down the switcher channel when this

---------13:57----------
signal is present so this here is an N

---------14:00----------
channel MOSFET the way an N channel

---------14:02----------
MOSFET works and you can figure this out

---------14:04----------
from reading my document if you are at

---------14:06----------
all intimidated by this we go over how

---------14:09----------
this works and this document is 110%

---------14:12----------
free it's not like I got a paid version

---------14:13----------
of it that features all the you got

---------14:15----------
a you know for the real version all of

---------14:17----------
this stuff is really like kindergarten

---------14:20----------
level stupid and it's does it's designed

---------14:23----------
so that even somebody like me may be

---------14:24----------
able to learn something from it now back

---------14:27----------
to the PDF over here this is an N

---------14:31----------
channel MOSFET which means that when the

---------14:32----------
voltage on the gate G is higher than the

---------14:35----------
source s then this will allow the

---------14:39----------
voltage the flow from drain to source or

---------14:42----------
source to drain and over here our source

---------14:45----------
is ground which means that any voltage

---------14:47----------
on the gate anything at all is going to

---------14:49----------
allow this to open and it's then going

---------14:51----------
to send our switcher channel to ground

---------14:54----------
and it won't work so if P 5 vs 3 enable

---------14:57----------
L is present it will turn this

---------15:00----------
transistor on which will stop this from

---------15:01----------
working that

---------15:02----------
why it says underscore L by the way P 5

---------15:04----------
vs 3 the name of the power rail

---------15:06----------
underscore en enable it underscore L

---------15:10----------
when this signal is low so this signal

---------15:12----------
over here enable this power line enabled

---------15:15----------
P 5 es 3 is going to be asserted when

---------15:18----------
the signal is low because when this is

---------15:21----------
high this transistor is going to open

---------15:24----------
and or type 2 closes the corrector you

---------15:27----------
get the send power through and then it's

---------15:29----------
going to go to ground and then the

---------15:30----------
entropy shut down so the first thing I'm

---------15:32----------
interested in doing here is checking out

---------15:34----------
the entropy are you actually being told

---------15:37----------
to turn on I'm also interested in

---------15:38----------
checking out P 5 es 3 en l so let's see

---------15:41----------
where that is going to be on the board

---------15:42----------
we're gonna take a look and see where

---------15:44----------
that is on our board so if we take a

---------15:47----------
look at Q 7 2 2 1 over here at Q 7 2 2 1

---------15:52----------
you are going to have the P 5 vs 3e n L

---------15:58----------
now I think that that rail is actually

---------16:01----------
present and shorted to ground I think

---------16:02----------
that based on our amperage usage and

---------16:04----------
before I even measure this I'm going to

---------16:06----------
tell you that that enable signal is

---------16:07----------
likely going to be present the reason

---------16:10----------
I'm saying that is because rather it's

---------16:11----------
taking 200 milliamps rather than 20 it

---------16:14----------
takes 20 to 40 milliamps when the

---------16:17----------
signals are not present and it's not

---------16:19----------
trying to make those rels it takes 2 to

---------16:21----------
400 milliamps when the signals are

---------16:23----------
present and it is making those rails or

---------16:25----------
is trying to make those rails but it's

---------16:27----------
being shorted to ground again one of the

---------16:29----------
ways that you get much faster at this

---------16:30----------
and much more efficient especially if

---------16:32----------
you're working on the same device over

---------16:33----------
and over again are the same small set of

---------16:35----------
devices is every time you figure out

---------16:38----------
what your problem is whether you it's to

---------16:39----------
your one or two of your three our

---------16:41----------
troubleshooting process you write down

---------16:43----------
all the symptoms the device showed you

---------16:44----------
document that you don't plug it into a

---------16:46----------
regular MagSafe you plug it into

---------16:47----------
something you can measure the amperage

---------16:48----------
and you check you and remember your

---------16:51----------
measurements on different power lines or

---------16:53----------
different rails and then you can then

---------16:54----------
associate those with specific problems

---------16:56----------
so I'm going to make the guess that this

---------16:59----------
signal over here is actually already

---------17:01----------
present on this board we're just going

---------17:03----------
to double check and see and Lois your

---------17:06----------
trousers are unzipped you may show more

---------17:08----------
than you expect on crotch cam

---------17:10----------
maybe that's by design

---------17:14----------
and as you can see we have three point

---------17:18----------
five volts which means that this is

---------17:19----------
being in wait a second no that's not

---------17:22----------
being enabled because that's a bit only

---------17:24----------
enabled when it's low ah okay Lois may

---------17:28----------
have been wrong here so P 5 es 3 en el p

---------17:32----------
5 that means if this is high this is

---------17:34----------
purposely going to be sending P 5 vs 3

---------17:36----------
enable L to ground and that is that's no

---------17:40----------
good so let's try and figure out what's

---------17:42----------
going on here and let's also see if

---------17:43----------
that's steady or if that's pulsing I may

---------17:45----------
be right after all okay interesting it's

---------17:49----------
going back and forth and it's pulsing

---------17:51----------
now one of the reasons it could be

---------17:52----------
pulsing is because there is a short

---------17:54----------
circuit to ground it could be detecting

---------17:55----------
there's a short circuit to ground and

---------17:57----------
then turning the chip off to protect

---------17:59----------
itself let's see if that's what's going

---------18:00----------
on we're going so we here we're gonna

---------18:02----------
measure to see if we have a short to

---------18:04----------
ground on the output where pp5 es 3 is

---------18:07----------
so I'm gonna go over here to where these

---------18:09----------
capacitors are were it's don't work and

---------18:11----------
we're gonna see what the resistance to

---------18:13----------
ground is 11 Ohm's Mike you can't see

---------18:18----------
that hey now you can get 25 ohms 31 ohms

---------18:23----------
39 ohms 50 hmm interesting we had

---------18:26----------
something similar to a short but it

---------18:29----------
appears to be going away the short

---------18:32----------
circuit appears to be curing itself

---------18:34----------
imagine that much interesting Wow

---------18:40----------
the self fixing board yeah we're up to

---------18:46----------
six kilohms at this point you know I'm

---------18:49----------
gonna do something that's a little

---------18:50----------
experimental here since I don't see much

---------18:53----------
in terms of obvious damage I am going to

---------18:56----------
remove that transistor that is gonna

---------18:58----------
keep this chip from turning on and see

---------19:01----------
if my rail is created so if you look at

---------19:04----------
the schematic and board view you'll see

---------19:06----------
that like I said that the end trip

---------19:09----------
signal has to be high if it is sent to

---------19:11----------
ground it will shut down the switcher

---------19:13----------
channel and q7 two to one is what's

---------19:15----------
responsible for shutting down the sensor

---------19:17----------
chap the switcher channel so I'm gonna

---------19:20----------
remove that chip and see if that has any

---------19:22----------
effect on our rail being made what I'm

---------19:26----------
looking to do here is see if there's an

---------19:27----------
issue

---------19:28----------
the chip or with the NA or the stuff

---------19:30----------
that's making the enable circuitry is

---------19:32----------
this stuff that's making the enable

---------19:33----------
circuitry turning off because it sees

---------19:34----------
that there's a bad chip or is there

---------19:36----------
something else to it entirely there's

---------19:38----------
only one way to find out

---------19:46----------
we're going to take this chip off and

---------19:49----------
move it to the side where the chip will

---------19:52----------
be sitting sideways so we've disabled

---------19:55----------
its ability to tell itself to shut down

---------19:57----------
for the system to regulate it shutting

---------19:59----------
down and it is capable of making 5 volts

---------20:02----------
at that point so the the circuitry

---------20:04----------
itself is do is good this chip is good

---------20:06----------
the transistors are good all of that is

---------20:08----------
good what we need to do is figure out

---------20:10----------
why the system is telling it to do that

---------20:15----------
that's where the fun comes in so this is

---------20:18----------
very strange because at this point we

---------20:20----------
have no reason for for 200 mill amp amp

---------20:23----------
drop there's nothing on this board they

---------20:25----------
could really use 200 milliamps at the

---------20:29----------
point in time because we're not entering

---------20:31----------
an s3 State yeah there's no it nothing

---------20:41----------
in an s3 State here so it doesn't quite

---------20:43----------
make sense what the eff is going on here

---------20:50----------
well I do still have this thermal camera

---------20:53----------
here that I have not unplugged yet and

---------20:55----------
since it is right next to me I might as

---------20:57----------
well make some use of it so if you

---------20:59----------
direct your attention to the screen you

---------21:01----------
will see a thermal Peppe thermal Peppe

---------21:04----------
is the god of short circuits king of the

---------21:06----------
Andals in the first frogs king of

---------21:10----------
protector of the realm okay now as you

---------21:16----------
can see we it's about fifth yeah 50

---------21:20----------
Celsius is being used right over here

---------21:23----------
and if we turn the board around you'll

---------21:26----------
see that what is getting boiling hot is

---------21:29----------
the platform controller hub chip now the

---------21:32----------
platform controller hub chip is powered

---------21:34----------
by PP 3 V 3 S 5 in the beginning stages

---------21:37----------
of the Machine turning on and the TP 3 V

---------21:39----------
3 S 5 is a rail that's created by the

---------21:42----------
chip we saw and it's told to be created

---------21:44----------
by this chip over here which is the SMC

---------21:49----------
so the SMC tells this chip create PP 3 V

---------21:53----------
3 S 5 the PCH tells this chip create PP

---------21:58----------
5 es 3 so

---------22:00----------
this chip is doing fine it's not that

---------22:02----------
the PCH it's not that the that chip

---------22:05----------
creating the five and three volt rails

---------22:07----------
is bad it's that one chip that's

---------22:09----------
supposed to be telling it to do what

---------22:11----------
it's doing is doing its job and the

---------22:13----------
other chip that supposed to be telling

---------22:14----------
it to do what it's doing is apparently

---------22:17----------
seemingly burning just sitting here and

---------22:21----------
burning so we had one machine tonight

---------22:25----------
that had a bad PCH that did not have a

---------22:28----------
bad PCH originally it looked like one

---------22:31----------
cap but then was bad PCH at this point

---------22:33----------
we have yet another machine that is a

---------22:35----------
bad PCH which we're going to leave in

---------22:38----------
the status for Paul if you need

---------22:40----------
something to be worked on with BGA

---------22:42----------
rework if you need the zomo if you want

---------22:45----------
to outsource a job that requires

---------22:48----------
browsing eBay and Aliexpress and golden

---------22:50----------
chipset and all these other CIC vendors

---------22:54----------
to fight to spend fifty to eighty

---------22:57----------
dollars a piece on chipsets that may or

---------23:00----------
may not work that take 45 minutes to

---------23:04----------
solder onto the board that you cannot

---------23:06----------
return if the chip that you bought was

---------23:09----------
soldered before even if the chip itself

---------23:10----------
is bad if you want those types of jobs

---------23:13----------
that are only done on a commission basis

---------23:16----------
to be performed live on camera with a

---------23:20----------
zamo that is on Paul's s's desk don't

---------23:24----------
delay send your machine to 186 First

---------23:28----------
Avenue New York New York one zero zero

---------23:31----------
zero nine Rossman repair group attention

---------23:35----------
Paul if you have a pedantic repair job

---------23:38----------
that will likely waste hours of time and

---------23:41----------
and not only not make money but cost

---------23:43----------
money to do send your machine to

---------23:47----------
rossmann repair Group attention Paul

---------23:50----------
Paul is soon going to have as AMA on his

---------23:52----------
desk that he's going to be using to work

---------23:55----------
on all of these lovely boards that are

---------23:57----------
just so easy to fix it just needs this

---------24:02----------
needs a little bit of your soul so this

---------24:04----------
board has a dead PCH which means that on

---------24:07----------
a machine that is this old given the

---------24:10----------
amount of work that would have to go

---------24:12----------
into replacing the PCH thank you very

---------24:13----------
much and

---------24:14----------
well I really appreciate that that's

---------24:16----------
very kind of you the on a machine that

---------24:18----------
is this old that is a complete and utter

---------24:22----------
waste of time because even if you do win

---------24:25----------
and spend 45 minutes replacing a single

---------24:28----------
chip after doing all this diagnostic

---------24:30----------
work even if that chip does work which

---------24:34----------
let's face it it it is eBay it is

---------24:36----------
CIC it is golden ship said it is China

---------24:39----------
it's not even if that BGA chip you get

---------24:42----------
does work that's quite a bit of time you

---------24:45----------
spend to fix the Sandy Bridge and at

---------24:50----------
this point with the amount of time I've

---------24:53----------
wasted tonight and the amount of no

---------24:55----------
fixes I've had I'm feeling quite sandy

---------24:58----------
as well so let's go over before I end

---------25:02----------
the stream and ride my bike off the

---------25:04----------
Williamsburg Bridge we're going to go

---------25:06----------
over why it is that pp3 v3 s5 was being

---------25:10----------
creative at PB v es4 was not so we're

---------25:13----------
going to take a look at that signal that

---------25:15----------
was we were required to get P P 5 vs 3

---------25:23----------
working P 5 es 3 enable L needs to be

---------25:27----------
low remember so let's see where PBS 3

---------25:30----------
enable L comes from P 5 es3 enable L

---------25:36----------
this is going to be a signal over here

---------25:39----------
that can be pulled to ground and made to

---------25:41----------
go away

---------25:42----------
remember the signal has to go away it

---------25:44----------
has to be low in order for the P 5 vs 3

---------25:47----------
to be enabled so Q 70 911 is an

---------25:50----------
n-channel MOSFET that will open when the

---------25:53----------
voltage and the gate is higher than the

---------25:54----------
source and here the source is grap so it

---------25:56----------
will allow this signal that we need to

---------25:57----------
get rid of to go to ground if there's

---------26:00----------
voltage in the gate and the voltage in

---------26:01----------
the gate is going to come from p.m.

---------26:05----------
sleep s4l p.m. sleep s4l comes from the

---------26:09----------
platform controller hub over here and

---------26:11----------
the platform controller hub is the chip

---------26:13----------
that I just showed you on my Peppa

---------26:15----------
thermal cam as being on fire so we have

---------26:21----------
p.m. sleep s4 now going out of you 1800

---------26:23----------
u 1800 is platform controller hub and if

---------26:27----------
we take a look over

---------26:28----------
here you'll notice that platform

---------26:32----------
controller hub when we plug the board in

---------26:36----------
we're gonna take them next safe do this

---------26:40----------
ahh 57 Celsius and it's not even on this

---------26:51----------
is junk

---------26:53----------
complete and utter junk

---------27:05----------
I'm going to go cry now I'll see you in

---------27:08----------
the next stream and as always I hope you

---------27:10----------
learned something
