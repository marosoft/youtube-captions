---------00:00----------
hi so today we're gonna be discussing a

---------00:01----------
no backlight issue this is brought to me

---------00:03----------
by a friend who is being driven nuts by

---------00:05----------
it it's an eight to zero twenty five

---------00:07----------
twenty three board for an a twelve

---------00:09----------
eighty six from 2009 make a you know

---------00:11----------
little piece of I usually prefer

---------00:14----------
avoiding working on these but for a

---------00:16----------
friend that will always help so let's

---------00:18----------
take a look here and see what's going on

---------00:20----------
so when I shrink this so you can see

---------00:23----------
what's going on a microscope camera you

---------00:24----------
will see some nasty nasty

---------00:28----------
so to give you an idea of what's going

---------00:29----------
on here let's get a pair of tweezers

---------00:33----------
okay my desk is disgusting so I can't

---------00:35----------
find a set of tweezers it's about time

---------00:38----------
for me to go home tired and dead tired

---------00:41----------
alright so over here you're gonna see a

---------00:43----------
wire and this wires going for my power

---------00:45----------
supply and it's going to a pin on the LP

---------00:48----------
eighty five forty three and that's a

---------00:49----------
ground wire so I have this this a power

---------00:51----------
supply here that I use for testing

---------00:53----------
purposes I can use it for finding shorts

---------00:55----------
and I can also use it to provide power

---------00:56----------
to where I think power should be if

---------00:58----------
there's no power now one of the things

---------01:00----------
that went wrong on this and just go over

---------01:02----------
to the screen capture I love this

---------01:05----------
software I love open broadcaster

---------01:06----------
software like somebody made a comment

---------01:08----------
recently on my channel about how yeah

---------01:10----------
finally open source software that

---------01:11----------
actually works and yes this this this

---------01:14----------
does work I know I know it's

---------01:16----------
surprising because it's open source

---------01:17----------
software for multimedia purposes you

---------01:19----------
wouldn't expect it to work but it does

---------01:21----------
and it's cross-platform and it's free i

---------01:23----------
mean i don't have you these people

---------01:25----------
hundred bucks if you need something

---------01:26----------
anything remotely like this try it out

---------01:28----------
and please donate to them please please

---------01:30----------
show that people are actually willing to

---------01:31----------
pay for open source software that

---------01:33----------
doesn't suck because there is a severe

---------01:35----------
lack of it when it comes to any type of

---------01:37----------
you know video editing video recording

---------01:40----------
production kind of stuff like that

---------01:42----------
anyway so here's what was going on i've

---------01:45----------
talked about the backlight circuited

---------01:46----------
enough other videos that i don't feel

---------01:48----------
like i have to go into how this thing

---------01:49----------
works here at long story short this is a

---------01:51----------
DC blue circuit so you have input here

---------01:53----------
which is twelve point six volts you have

---------01:55----------
a backlight controller over here this is

---------01:57----------
an inductor also known as a coil also

---------02:00----------
known as the thing that never goes bad

---------02:01----------
so if you read on a forum and you have

---------02:03----------
no backlight you need to replace the

---------02:04----------
coil no you need to X because that form

---------02:06----------
is filled with idiots over here

---------02:08----------
you have a diode and over here you have

---------02:10----------
output of backlight now to give you a

---------02:12----------
very very very

---------02:13----------
quick and dirty and nasty introduction

---------02:15----------
how a DC booze circuit works this is an

---------02:18----------
inductor the power that goes through an

---------02:19----------
inductor is gonna go through it in a

---------02:21----------
funny way compared to how it would just

---------02:22----------
go through a straight wire now this over

---------02:25----------
here is actually gonna take this 12

---------02:27----------
volts that's coming along here it's

---------02:28----------
actually gonna short it to ground an

---------02:29----------
interval is very very now what that's

---------02:31----------
gonna do is that's gonna cause the power

---------02:32----------
that's coming through here to zoom

---------02:34----------
through here as fast as possible but

---------02:36----------
then it's gonna stop because the right

---------02:38----------
over here with this chip is shorting it

---------02:39----------
to ground is gonna go away so you're

---------02:41----------
gonna have power coming in going and

---------02:42----------
stop going in stop in stop and this

---------02:44----------
constant starting and stopping short

---------02:46----------
with the inductor behind it it's gonna

---------02:48----------
cause voltage to build up in the

---------02:50----------
inductor so you're not gonna have 12

---------02:51----------
volts you're gonna have 12 volts 16

---------02:53----------
volts 18 volts 20 volts 30 volts 40

---------02:55----------
volts and that is going to get sent out

---------02:57----------
this way so it goes through this diode

---------02:58----------
these capacitors smooth it out so

---------03:00----------
instead of looking like a bunch of

---------03:01----------
pulses of it just looks like a

---------03:02----------
straight line and that's what allows you

---------03:05----------
to start out with 12 volts and actually

---------03:07----------
get out to 40 or 50 obviously you're not

---------03:09----------
gonna have the same current capability

---------03:10----------
that you would if you were just sending

---------03:12----------
12 volts because you're boosting the

---------03:13----------
voltage at you know at the same starting

---------03:15----------
voltage without adding anything so but

---------03:17----------
this is a screen you don't need a lot of

---------03:19----------
power to power a screen it's an LED

---------03:20----------
backlit screen for a laptop so what

---------03:22----------
happened here is this diode was open so

---------03:25----------
a diode is supposed to pass electricity

---------03:27----------
in one direction but I've resistance to

---------03:28----------
it in another direction this diode was

---------03:30----------
open which means that you know 20 30 40

---------03:32----------
50 volts for the screen over here was

---------03:35----------
actually going backwards and so what I

---------03:38----------
thought is so this is a 12 volt circuit

---------03:41----------
over here so everything going backwards

---------03:42----------
over here once this diode blew for a

---------03:44----------
split second there was an up to 50 volts

---------03:46----------
that went back this way and probably

---------03:47----------
sodomized everything I replaced LED

---------03:50----------
driver no luck I looked in the area you

---------03:53----------
know the after the diode was blown

---------03:54----------
you know caps were good there again the

---------03:56----------
coil keep in mind the coil will never

---------03:59----------
die I can repeat with me the coil will

---------04:01----------
never die it's not the inductors

---------04:03----------
if you look at just you just look at

---------04:05----------
what this looks like you'll

---------04:06----------
understand what I mean I mean like let

---------04:07----------
me just bring it up on the microscope

---------04:09----------
just so you can get a better

---------04:10----------
appreciation of why this thing will

---------04:12----------
never die and why all these people on

---------04:14----------
internet forums they tell you that the

---------04:15----------
coil is what is bad or just complete

---------04:17----------
 idiot ignorant dumb ass

---------04:21----------
so let's find it over here

---------04:24----------
and

---------04:26----------
Yeah right so the coil is so the

---------04:32----------
inductor so see okay you see this you

---------04:36----------
see this this is not good this good

---------04:38----------
you're not gonna break this this is you

---------04:40----------
can't see it because it's outside of my

---------04:42----------
viewable range okay I see that that

---------04:44----------
that's you're never gonna break this

---------04:46----------
this is huge this is a huge coil that is

---------04:49----------
no you you're not breaking that so

---------04:50----------
people who say that that's what blows

---------04:51----------
again they're idiots don't listen to

---------04:54----------
them they're dumb okay back here so you

---------04:56----------
have this now I went backwards and

---------04:58----------
backwards and backwards until I got over

---------04:59----------
here this is the next step

---------05:01----------
see this so this says critical in its

---------05:03----------
voltage into the LP eight five four

---------05:05----------
three I'm not sure what this is supposed

---------05:07----------
to be so since I'm not sure what this is

---------05:09----------
supposed to be as you can see on pin 23

---------05:11----------
I don't know what that's supposed to be

---------05:12----------
I decided that I would use my brain so

---------05:15----------
the way that I decided to use my brain

---------05:17----------
is I decided to Google this LP eight

---------05:20----------
five four three number over here when I

---------05:22----------
google it I get a datasheet now when I

---------05:24----------
look at the data sheet you're gonna get

---------05:25----------
to something called pin description so

---------05:27----------
it's gonna tell you what every pin

---------05:28----------
actually does so it says on pin 23 input

---------05:30----------
power supply 5.5 to 22 volts see pen 23

---------05:34----------
VN input power supply 5.5 to 25 three

---------05:38----------
volt so it gives me an idea

---------05:39----------
now over here when I follow this VN up

---------05:41----------
this way you're gonna we go up here it

---------05:44----------
shows me that it has power that comes to

---------05:46----------
these transistors so remember drain to

---------05:48----------
source source to drain over here this is

---------05:51----------
pretty much like it's it's either open

---------05:52----------
or it's closed think of it like a wire

---------05:53----------
so the when everything's working right

---------05:55----------
with this system when it's receiving the

---------05:57----------
voltage as opposed to this goes through

---------05:58----------
here this goes through here so the way

---------06:00----------
this works is this is pp 5 vs oh this is

---------06:03----------
5 volts from the computers one of the

---------06:05----------
main power rails and Phi is it says 5.5

---------06:09----------
222 is acceptable let's just assume that

---------06:10----------
5 volts is good enough now it's going

---------06:13----------
through here it's going through here you

---------06:15----------
remember how it transistor works drain

---------06:17----------
to source is just like a resistor that

---------06:19----------
turns into a wire eventually depending

---------06:20----------
on what's at the gate you're going

---------06:22----------
through here then it goes through here

---------06:24----------
and then it goes through here so and now

---------06:30----------
this power is not is gonna get sent to

---------06:32----------
ground depending on whether backlight

---------06:34----------
enabled here is doing so the whole idea

---------06:36----------
here is this is 5 volts input for the

---------06:38----------
chip this is a 5 volt power rail

---------06:39----------
the chip needs to actually function it

---------06:41----------
needs that you know you have 12 point 6

---------06:43----------
volts here that's not power for the chip

---------06:44----------
this pp bus underscore s o underscore

---------06:47----------
LCD back that underscore power is not

---------06:49----------
what actually POW is the chip what

---------06:50----------
powers the chip is this 5 volt input

---------06:54----------
this 12 point 6 volts over here that's

---------06:56----------
power that the chip is going to

---------06:57----------
transform in a 50 but that's not what

---------06:59----------
actually powers the chip and allows it

---------07:01----------
to do what it's doing that's just the

---------07:02----------
power rail that the chip will then be

---------07:04----------
controlling once it turns on V in is the

---------07:06----------
power that the chip actually needs in

---------07:08----------
order to turn on and get to work and

---------07:09----------
that is only going to show up when this

---------07:11----------
backlight enable signal is over here or

---------07:13----------
else that 5 volt power supply for the

---------07:15----------
chip is going to get shorted to ground

---------07:17----------
now when I measured over here I notice

---------07:20----------
that there wasn't 5 volts over there and

---------07:21----------
these resistors were measuring the way

---------07:23----------
they were supposed to be and these

---------07:24----------
transistors were measuring the way that

---------07:26----------
they were supposed to be so what do you

---------07:28----------
do well what you do is you put if you

---------07:32----------
try to put 5 volts on that rail and see

---------07:34----------
if it fix the problem and that's what

---------07:35----------
you can see on the microscope so in the

---------07:37----------
microscope what you're gonna be able to

---------07:38----------
see is that on 5 volts I have a piece of

---------07:42----------
cat 5 wire which is why I'm very very

---------07:44----------
careful about what I'm doing in my desk

---------07:45----------
because I know if I touch that thing the

---------07:46----------
wrong way is going to rip that pad off

---------07:48----------
of the board completely and it's just

---------07:50----------
gonna be a miserable miserable nightmare

---------07:51----------
so as you can see there I have that

---------07:53----------
piece of cat 5 wire I had to trim it a

---------07:55----------
little bit so you have little leave one

---------07:56----------
strand of it going from my HP Agilent 65

---------08:00----------
42 a power supply to there so that I can

---------08:02----------
send 5 volts and if you want to see if

---------08:05----------
that fixes my problem you could see what

---------08:07----------
happens when I decide to turn on my

---------08:09----------
power supply so my power supply here is

---------08:11----------
set to 5 volts so when I turn my power

---------08:14----------
supply on when I hit the button what

---------08:16----------
happens but a light I get a light in a

---------08:20----------
flashing question mark which means that

---------08:22----------
I fixed my problem now this is gonna

---------08:24----------
require a little bit of arts and crafts

---------08:25----------
which I hate so my friend is gonna be

---------08:27----------
doing that himself because what happened

---------08:29----------
here is those resistors are actually on

---------08:31----------
the other side of the board so I'm just

---------08:33----------
gonna remove this I'm gonna unplug it

---------08:35----------
what I'm doing so that I could show you

---------08:36----------
a little bit of what I mean and you know

---------08:38----------
once I unplug this he and he's gonna be

---------08:40----------
on his own such is life so I'm gonna

---------08:44----------
show you what I mean in the microscope

---------08:45----------
let me shrink myself since you don't

---------08:49----------
need to see me anymore

---------08:52----------
I'm also going to show you what some of

---------08:54----------
the hints look like all right yeah I

---------08:58----------
didn't have the air filter on

---------09:06----------
there's a lot of flux there I'll have to

---------09:08----------
clean that so see that is the pin right

---------09:10----------
there see that that is the pin that I

---------09:12----------
pointed to with the soldering iron now

---------09:13----------
see how it goes to that see how that

---------09:15----------
doesn't really look very nice anymore

---------09:17----------
yeah it doesn't look very nice now when

---------09:20----------
you see something like that that

---------09:21----------
actually goes to the other side of the

---------09:22----------
board those when they when you see

---------09:25----------
something coming from a trace from a pad

---------09:27----------
and it's going a circle and there's a

---------09:29----------
hole in the middle that's actually going

---------09:31----------
to be going to something on the other

---------09:32----------
side of the board so what I want to do

---------09:34----------
here is I want to show you at the other

---------09:35----------
side of the board looks like I'm gonna

---------09:42----------
show you where those little resistors

---------09:44----------
are so what I showed you there was that

---------09:46----------
there were some resistors in that

---------09:47----------
circuit just in case you forget what

---------09:49----------
they look like let me just show it to

---------09:50----------
you again on the screen capturing tool

---------09:53----------
so right over here you see you have our

---------09:56----------
97.1 you have a nine seven thirty-five

---------09:58----------
you have a nine seven no two

---------10:00----------
so those are all going to be in this

---------10:04----------
area that I'm about to show you

---------10:23----------
yeah so what's over here and you you can

---------10:25----------
you can guess well you know where the

---------10:28----------
voltage that is messed up as opposed to

---------10:29----------
be like hint to this this goes to the

---------10:31----------
other side of the board so what my

---------10:33----------
friend is going to have to do is when he

---------10:35----------
has the time to come here he's going to

---------10:36----------
have to make a hole in the board in that

---------10:39----------
area and then he's gonna have to run a

---------10:41----------
wire because the trace from one side of

---------10:46----------
the board to the other side of the board

---------10:47----------
is actually blown these are points that

---------10:48----------
are very very easy to break because

---------10:49----------
they're very very small very very thin

---------10:51----------
so he's going to do he's but he's most

---------10:53----------
likely going to do he's going to take a

---------10:55----------
piece of battery wire like this which is

---------10:58----------
pretty good it's good stuff for this so

---------11:00----------
this is an a 1278 battery connector

---------11:02----------
that's broken he's going to take a

---------11:03----------
little wire like this he's gonna make a

---------11:05----------
little hole on the board using something

---------11:07----------
that he can man he can use to poke

---------11:09----------
through the whole thing like this and

---------11:11----------
he's gonna poke the wire through and

---------11:12----------
he's going to solder it on both ends to

---------11:14----------
where it's supposed to go and that's

---------11:15----------
going to fix the problem you know again

---------11:17----------
not all backlight issues are simple a

---------11:19----------
lot of people like again this this is

---------11:21----------
one of the reasons that I don't no

---------11:22----------
longer have it no back like coupon so

---------11:23----------
hey I used to have a bit no back like

---------11:25----------
coupon meaning if your only issue is no

---------11:26----------
backlight you would get the service for

---------11:29----------
cheaper not even just the fact that

---------11:31----------
nobody who sent use the no back like

---------11:32----------
coupon actually had no backlight your

---------11:33----------
issue as your computer was totally dead

---------11:35----------
and that's why you had no backlight but

---------11:36----------
also sometimes they're a pain in the ass

---------11:38----------
again I mean he he's not dumb easy you

---------11:41----------
know he's he has experience with this

---------11:42----------
not to mention he was trained by the

---------11:44----------
best not gonna say who but the point is

---------11:47----------
you know sometimes you have these issues

---------11:49----------
that are just a pain in the ass and it's

---------11:50----------
not as simple as you think it's going to

---------11:52----------
be just because it's a no backlight

---------11:53----------
doesn't mean it's gonna be easy so again

---------11:55----------
just to go over it again on the screen

---------11:57----------
capturing tool let me shrink this so you

---------12:00----------
can see the screen capturing tool you

---------12:03----------
know this is a DC to DC boost circuit

---------12:05----------
you start out with twelve point six

---------12:07----------
volts over here and it's going to go

---------12:10----------
through an inductor now what you're

---------12:12----------
gonna do is right after the inductor

---------12:13----------
you're gonna short it to ground but

---------12:14----------
you're gonna you're going to short it to

---------12:16----------
ground in with the changing frequency so

---------12:18----------
it's gonna go to the ground and stop go

---------12:20----------
to ground and stop go to ground and stop

---------12:21----------
and that's going to create pulsing so

---------12:24----------
the voltage is gonna get ripped through

---------12:26----------
this inductor which it doesn't like you

---------12:28----------
can read about that if you read up or go

---------12:30----------
to college and learn about how DC to DC

---------12:32----------
boost circuits work I'm not gonna

---------12:33----------
explain it the scientific way here I

---------12:35----------
don't have the vocabulary to know

---------12:37----------
do I care to make things more difficult

---------12:38----------
for you - no reason but think of it like

---------12:40----------
stopping short in a car like for that

---------12:42----------
one moment that you're going like this

---------12:43----------
you're going really really fast and

---------12:45----------
thinking about stopping short over and

---------12:46----------
over again you know think about the

---------12:48----------
energy that happens every time you do

---------12:49----------
that and that's what you're doing here

---------12:50----------
so this chip is shorting that twelve

---------12:52----------
point six volts the ground but very very

---------12:54----------
quickly than stopping very very quickly

---------12:55----------
than stopping through a coil which is a

---------12:57----------
pain in the ass to get the power through

---------12:59----------
and what it happens is you wind up

---------13:01----------
getting that voltage built up in the

---------13:02----------
coil so you have 12 instead of it just

---------13:04----------
being 12 volts you have 12 volts then 12

---------13:06----------
volts then 12 volts you wind up with

---------13:08----------
something like 36 volts and again you

---------13:09----------
don't have the same amperage that you

---------13:11----------
would have if it was just a straight 36

---------13:13----------
volts but the voltage itself is actually

---------13:16----------
higher and then you put that through a

---------13:18----------
diode and that winds up going out so

---------13:20----------
that you don't have all that power going

---------13:21----------
back through here and causing a

---------13:23----------
[ __ ]

---------13:23----------
now this diode itself was open which

---------13:26----------
wound up blowing things that came before

---------13:28----------
it so the LPA t5 43 didn't look any good

---------13:31----------
on the Sun definitely not on this

---------13:34----------
section and mainly the this voltage in

---------13:37----------
that the point directly right behind it

---------13:39----------
was burned to we fixed that and it

---------13:41----------
works you saw that when I hit the on

---------13:43----------
button on my power supply that it all

---------13:44----------
worked

---------13:45----------
hopefully you learned something today

---------13:46----------
hopefully you learned something about

---------13:47----------
how a DC to DC boost circuit works when

---------13:50----------
you actually want to not just take

---------13:51----------
voltage and bring it down I've talked

---------13:52----------
about that in other videos how you take

---------13:54----------
a higher voltage like five volts or

---------13:56----------
eight volts or 12 volts and turn it into

---------13:57----------
one volt for CPU vcore this is how you

---------13:59----------
do the opposite this is how you take 12

---------14:01----------
volts new machines main rail and turn

---------14:03----------
that into 36 39 or 50 volts required the

---------14:06----------
power of the backlight on the screen

---------14:07----------
without any other power supply so

---------14:09----------
hopefully you learned a little bit about

---------14:10----------
the backlight circuit hopefully you

---------14:11----------
learned a little bit of basic

---------14:12----------
electronics again DC blue circuit ignore

---------14:15----------
all the again you're gonna read pages

---------14:17----------
upon pages of electronics theory and

---------14:19----------
you're just gonna want to kill yourself

---------14:20----------
it's just it's very simple you yeah and

---------14:22----------
all this entire page of stuff but chip

---------14:24----------
is there just stop the car short over

---------14:26----------
and over again it's those little stops

---------14:28----------
and stops and starts and stops and

---------14:29----------
starts and getting slammed through that

---------14:31----------
case the 12 volts and brings it up to 36

---------14:33----------
to 39 I know a lot of people who are

---------14:35----------
good with electronics I know a lot of

---------14:36----------
electronics professors a lot of hardcore

---------14:38----------
electronics diehard do-it-yourself

---------14:40----------
people are gonna hate me because I'm

---------14:42----------
explaining it in a way that I am but the

---------14:44----------
point here is not to explain it well you

---------14:46----------
you understand the formulas and you

---------14:48----------
understand all the nonsense behind it

---------14:49----------
all I want you to do is

---------14:51----------
understand in your head a basic idea of

---------14:53----------
how that works without having to get a

---------14:55----------
master's degree in college without

---------14:56----------
having to sit through a six-month course

---------14:57----------
without having to know what the little

---------14:59----------
symbols and the thin the theories mean I

---------15:00----------
want you to be able to look at this and

---------15:02----------
innately understand what's going on in

---------15:04----------
your brain with the knowledge that you

---------15:06----------
already have and if you can do that I've

---------15:07----------
done my job
