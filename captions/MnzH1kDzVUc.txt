---------00:00----------
alright so today we're going to be

---------00:01----------
hunting some liquid damage we're going

---------00:04----------
to continue trying to find it and I

---------00:06----------
think I have an idea where the liquids

---------00:08----------
going to be on this board where it

---------00:10----------
always is where you are never going to

---------00:12----------
think to look even if you have a power

---------00:14----------
supply even if you have free spray

---------00:16----------
there's one spot on this board that I

---------00:18----------
know nobody ever thinks to look and I

---------00:20----------
can tell before even ripping before even

---------00:22----------
going through exactly where it's going

---------00:24----------
to be and I hope that after this video

---------00:27----------
that you will also be an expert in

---------00:30----------
hunting liquid damage now let's do a

---------00:33----------
little bit of estimating what's going on

---------00:37----------
here so when i plug in the charger I

---------00:39----------
don't get a green light now as you guys

---------00:42----------
know the green light is created via the

---------00:44----------
one wire circuit which I've demonstrated

---------00:46----------
several hundred thousand times so I'm

---------00:49----------
not going to go in and demonstrate that

---------00:50----------
again but if you'd like you can watch

---------00:52----------
any one of my videos in the one wire

---------00:53----------
circuit I'll try to remember to put one

---------00:55----------
here in the cards which I'll probably

---------00:57----------
forget to put it there in the cards but

---------00:59----------
i'll try to put one here in the cards

---------01:01----------
where i explain it but in order for the

---------01:02----------
one wire circuit to work which is the

---------01:04----------
circuit that allows the smc to

---------01:06----------
communicate with the charger so a green

---------01:07----------
light will come on pp3 v42 meaning the

---------01:11----------
three-point 42 volt power rail on the

---------01:12----------
board has to show up and if we were to

---------01:15----------
measure that rail if we were to measure

---------01:17----------
it meaning putting the multimeter where

---------01:19----------
the camera actually sees it and having

---------01:21----------
it not fall off the desk or into voltage

---------01:24----------
mode black probe is going to go on

---------01:26----------
ground red probably expect pp3 v42 we

---------01:31----------
get zero volts now I have zero volts on

---------01:35----------
that power rail so next thing I want to

---------01:37----------
do is I want to see if there's a short

---------01:38----------
to ground so I'm going to go over to

---------01:39----------
Ohm's I'm going to go over the diode

---------01:41----------
mode because it gets me a nice fast

---------01:43----------
measurement I'm going to take the red

---------01:44----------
probe and I'm going to place it on

---------01:46----------
ground and now I'm going to take the

---------01:47----------
black probe and I'm going to place that

---------01:49----------
we're pp3 v42 should be and as you can

---------01:52----------
see we have a zero voltage drop between

---------01:54----------
our power line and ground so pp3 v42 is

---------01:58----------
directly shorted to ground now one of

---------02:01----------
the ways that we can try and figure out

---------02:02----------
where we should look before we even get

---------02:04----------
into this stuff of injecting voltage

---------02:06----------
into the board or anything crazy like

---------02:08----------
that is we can just look

---------02:11----------
the at the board view and we can try to

---------02:14----------
find everywhere that PP 3v for two shows

---------02:17----------
up on this model motherboard so let's

---------02:20----------
see if i can find where i put the

---------02:22----------
schematic for this model motherboard

---------02:23----------
because i think i accidentally just

---------02:26----------
click the race on it ah never mind that

---------02:30----------
would have sucked so what I like to do

---------02:32----------
is I like to try to find every single

---------02:34----------
spot on the board where PP three before

---------02:36----------
two is going to show up so I'm just

---------02:38----------
going to show you that right now

---------02:39----------
hopefully you can see what I see I used

---------02:41----------
to use the second monitor but for some

---------02:43----------
reason my second monitor died so now I

---------02:45----------
just the kind of guess as to what you

---------02:46----------
see so this is everywhere in the board

---------02:51----------
so when I do is I hit n and then i can

---------02:53----------
type in PP three before two it's going

---------02:55----------
to show me where PP three before two

---------02:56----------
shows up everywhere on the board so

---------02:58----------
anything that as a path to ground can be

---------03:01----------
a part so we're going to go over this

---------03:03----------
board and we're PP 3v for two shows up

---------03:05----------
I'm going to have this in the corner i'm

---------03:07----------
also gonna have the microscope in the

---------03:08----------
corner which is going to mean this one

---------03:11----------
and hopefully the microscope camera will

---------03:13----------
not freeze because the microscope camera

---------03:15----------
likes to freeze all the time that's what

---------03:17----------
it does so i reinstalled the driver do

---------03:21----------
what I'm going to see if that fixes the

---------03:22----------
problem I was this close to buying an

---------03:24----------
osprey because it's like a 900 he was

---------03:26----------
like eight or nine hundred dollar card

---------03:28----------
with dual hdmi input I was pretty close

---------03:30----------
to buying an osprey and what happened is

---------03:32----------
I was about to hit add to cart I hit add

---------03:36----------
to cart I was about to buy it I was

---------03:38----------
about to buy just closed it and buy and

---------03:41----------
then I saw there was like 800 bucks and

---------03:43----------
it's like you know what maybe I'll try

---------03:47----------
reinstall on that drive first and I

---------03:50----------
decided to try reinstalling the driver

---------03:51----------
cuz i don't want to spend 800 bucks and

---------03:53----------
I don't know what it is it's just like

---------03:54----------
I'm oh man you just get to a point

---------03:56----------
you're just done spending money and I

---------03:58----------
passed that point long ago anyway so

---------04:02----------
we're just going to go through the board

---------04:04----------
and I I want you to be able to see hello

---------04:06----------
here we go so I want you to see the

---------04:08----------
board view and this and hopefully it's

---------04:09----------
not blocking out too much of the screen

---------04:11----------
so we're going to look by the smcs

---------04:12----------
that's where PP three before two shows

---------04:14----------
up and I don't see any signs of liquid

---------04:16----------
damage I don't see any liquid damage to

---------04:17----------
be hunted here we're gonna look over

---------04:19----------
here since this is another point that it

---------04:20----------
shows up and I don't see any liquid

---------04:22----------
damage to be haunted there

---------04:24----------
you look on the keyboard connector and

---------04:26----------
yeah I just don't see any liquid to get

---------04:28----------
hunted there I don't see any so we

---------04:32----------
continue onwards and onwards and we look

---------04:35----------
where the actual coil for p b3 b4 to is

---------04:38----------
no liquid there we look in the ISO 6259

---------04:43----------
area where nothing there we look over

---------04:46----------
here and home Oh what's this I think a

---------04:51----------
friend if that's aI don't know if that's

---------04:54----------
liquid but if it is it's kind of weak I

---------04:55----------
don't even think that thing has PP three

---------04:57----------
before two now I look in the corner

---------05:01----------
alright so here's the thing this is what

---------05:04----------
gets people you could see some corrosion

---------05:06----------
over here right this corrosion this

---------05:09----------
stuff is is sometimes not there what

---------05:13----------
gets people is this see this you see

---------05:17----------
this this phone the liquid heightens of

---------05:20----------
the phone so even if you spray the free

---------05:22----------
spray the free spray doesn't get under

---------05:23----------
the foam and if you don't take off the

---------05:27----------
foam you'll never see that little shitty

---------05:31----------
camp for the audio circuit would see

---------05:35----------
came right off so i'm going to use jesse

---------05:38----------
jones is patented method of professional

---------05:40----------
repair Jesse Jones is patented method of

---------05:44----------
professional repair which is not to not

---------05:48----------
to use the hot air station of the

---------05:50----------
soldering trees is but to disco poop and

---------05:52----------
it does knock the capacitor right off

---------05:54----------
the bored with no regard to the

---------05:56----------
pads and no regard to the board and yeah

---------05:59----------
I do the same thing yeah shoot me what

---------06:03----------
do you want for me so we're gonna plug

---------06:06----------
it in and see if it turns on so we

---------06:10----------
knocked off that capacitor and it looks

---------06:13----------
like we have a low E we have a liteon

---------06:17----------
the charger that you literally can't see

---------06:18----------
because of the there we go the camera

---------06:25----------
light was very strong and that the

---------06:26----------
exposure to adjust we got the light and

---------06:28----------
then we have a fan spin hey sometimes

---------06:35----------
they're easy sometimes they're hard

---------06:37----------
don't know no no stop looking at me like

---------06:42----------
that man don't make me feel guilty you

---------06:43----------
have any idea many times I sit here and

---------06:45----------
I spend six hours and I don't get

---------06:47----------
anything done don't look at me like that

---------06:49----------
don't look at me like that don't look at

---------06:51----------
me like that no no no no no I'm not

---------06:54----------
listening to that with a no fix no fee

---------06:55----------
model you're not guilting me you're not

---------06:58----------
guilting me cut it stop stop it stop it

---------07:02----------
stop it cut it out I'm even gonna put

---------07:05----------
the capacitor back how about that I'm

---------07:07----------
even gonna put the capacitor back on you

---------07:12----------
really think I wasn't gonna put the

---------07:13----------
capacitor back on is that what you think

---------07:16----------
of me this is data I totally wouldn't

---------07:19----------
put the capacitor back on is it just me

---------07:21----------
it is that microscope looked better

---------07:22----------
since i reinstalled the driver I mean I

---------07:26----------
could be I could be I could be just

---------07:29----------
telling myself that to me yeah I'm

---------07:32----------
pretty sure I'm just telling myself that

---------07:33----------
that looks pretty nice that looks pretty

---------07:37----------
nice I maybe just be able to keep this

---------07:39----------
this junky the Sanford and Son truck of

---------07:42----------
a capture set up after all

---------07:46----------
ok

---------07:49----------
and we're even going to get rid of the

---------07:51----------
cap next to it because I don't like the

---------07:52----------
way it looks yeah I'll take this I will

---------07:55----------
take this an hour run with this this is

---------07:58----------
this is the joy of the no fix no fee

---------08:00----------
model and this is the joy of the

---------08:01----------
solutions based building model sometimes

---------08:04----------
you have no idea many videos I've done

---------08:06----------
where it's like two hours in and it is

---------08:09----------
just a complete utter nightmare and I

---------08:12----------
get nothing that don't make it to

---------08:14----------
youtube but this yeah you know what I'll

---------08:18----------
take an easy one every now and then also

---------08:22----------
easy is something that you kind of have

---------08:24----------
to define by how do I sit easeus

---------08:27----------
objective you know it's easy after you

---------08:32----------
spend the hundreds of hours to get to

---------08:34----------
this point but before then it's not easy

---------08:44----------
everything is easy once you know how to

---------08:46----------
do it

---------08:53----------
alright so now we're going to put those

---------08:56----------
capacitors there will scan for any other

---------08:59----------
kind of nastiness

---------09:06----------
literally the genius bar could have

---------09:08----------
fixed this boy I mean I want you to

---------09:12----------
think about this like what is required I

---------09:14----------
really should use the smaller nozzle

---------09:15----------
here since I'm by the SD card slot like

---------09:18----------
what tell me what is required to do this

---------09:24----------
you could you could have fix this with a

---------09:26----------
friggin pencil eraser just knock on it

---------09:30----------
it's lower our air since we're by some

---------09:32----------
ports

---------09:38----------
oh joy the smell of that phone burning

---------09:40----------
is so beautiful

---------10:01----------
and we got to flow the other one in a

---------10:03----------
place well we're pulling the second one

---------10:05----------
in the first one is going to flow and

---------10:08----------
also any of the damage under what I

---------10:09----------
imagine is either a headphone amp or a

---------10:11----------
speaker amp I see who it nicely refloat

---------10:15----------
and cleaned out my flux

---------10:38----------
farm

---------10:52----------
what I don't want any phone there go

---------10:56----------
away

---------11:02----------
these alcohol dispensers are cancer see

---------11:06----------
the little desk alcohol spent okay this

---------11:08----------
is probably going to work now that I've

---------11:09----------
it on camera how many times do I have to

---------11:11----------
hit it before there we go and all the

---------11:13----------
hits i did before before some alcohol

---------11:14----------
comes out of it

---------11:34----------
Oh

---------11:40----------
let's

---------11:59----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------12:01----------
you learn something
