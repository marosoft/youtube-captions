---------00:00----------
all right so today we're going to be

---------00:00----------
going over a board that doesn't see the

---------00:02----------
battery now I've already gone over the

---------00:04----------
theory as to the things that will keep

---------00:06----------
the board from running off of the

---------00:07----------
battery or seeing the battery or

---------00:09----------
charging the battery in a previous video

---------00:10----------
and here I'm going to go over a machine

---------00:12----------
that actually has the issue of it

---------00:14----------
doesn't recognize the battery that is

---------00:15----------
what it was brought in with so we'll

---------00:17----------
start from the beginning and we will

---------00:18----------
start the troubleshooting process so

---------00:20----------
first things first let's bring up a

---------00:22----------
schematic for this so as I've said the

---------00:24----------
battery speaks to the SMC on a data line

---------00:26----------
created by two resistors so that's the

---------00:29----------
first thing that we check before

---------00:30----------
anything else it is to give you a quick

---------00:32----------
recap if you didn't see the other video

---------00:34----------
over here you're going to see very poor

---------00:38----------
rendering of a PDF by windows is default

---------00:40----------
reader wow that's bad come on I don't

---------00:45----------
even get a hand tool oh this is the

---------00:50----------
default interface for Windows PDF Reader

---------00:53----------
sucks so I talked about what a data line

---------00:57----------
is so you have the 3.3 volt line of the

---------01:01----------
system here so you have a 3.4 volt line

---------01:03----------
of the system right over here and that

---------01:06----------
is going through a resistor this

---------01:07----------
resistor over here goes between several

---------01:10----------
points so this is going to be a flat

---------01:12----------
three point four volts here and every

---------01:14----------
time that there's communication one of

---------01:16----------
these chips whether the SMC the battery

---------01:19----------
charger which is the u 7000 chip or the

---------01:21----------
battery itself what it's going to do is

---------01:22----------
it's going to send pulses by shorting

---------01:25----------
that 3 point 4 volts to ground every

---------01:27----------
time that 3 point 4 volts gets shorted

---------01:29----------
to ground what's going to happen is that

---------01:30----------
you're going to see a spike or it goes

---------01:33----------
down to zero and every time it spikes

---------01:35----------
you're going to have it go down to zero

---------01:36----------
and then go back up to three point four

---------01:38----------
and go down to zero and go back up to

---------01:39----------
three point four and the duration of

---------01:41----------
these spikes how low and high in voltage

---------01:42----------
they go how far away they are from each

---------01:44----------
other it just think of it like Morse

---------01:46----------
code for a very oversimplified way of

---------01:49----------
describing and it's how these things

---------01:50----------
communicate so let's see what that looks

---------01:52----------
like on the board so our 50 to 80 and

---------01:55----------
our 50 to 80 1 right now as usual as

---------01:59----------
I've said in the past the board view

---------02:00----------
will always open differently than it

---------02:02----------
does on the schematic I mean the board

---------02:04----------
view will always open in a different

---------02:06----------
direction than the board is actually

---------02:07----------
facing you on the desk that's just how

---------02:08----------
this works so as you can see these are

---------02:10----------
the two resistors and on one side of the

---------02:11----------
resistor you have the 3 point 42 volts

---------02:13----------
and on

---------02:13----------
the other side of it you have this data

---------02:15----------
line which is smbus underscore SMC

---------02:18----------
underscore five underscore G three

---------02:20----------
underscore SDA and smbus underscore SMC

---------02:23----------
underscore five underscore G three

---------02:25----------
underscore SC l so let's look on the

---------02:27----------
board and see what those look like and

---------02:29----------
let's try and measure them let's see if

---------02:31----------
we actually get pulses so this is one of

---------02:32----------
the areas where the oscilloscope comes

---------02:34----------
in handy because with the oscilloscope I

---------02:36----------
will just be able to see it and what do

---------02:38----------
you know one of the resistors is not

---------02:40----------
there this is commonly caused when

---------02:42----------
people take things apart to fix it

---------02:45----------
themselves they were probably trying to

---------02:46----------
replace the battery connector on this

---------02:47----------
machine and this is what happened to it

---------02:49----------
so let's see what this looks like so

---------02:51----------
this is the battery indicator looks like

---------02:56----------
 so well somebody was probably

---------02:59----------
checking that what happened is probably

---------03:00----------
their nail went down here and the nail

---------03:02----------
just went

---------03:03----------
dink and ripped that resistor off the

---------03:05----------
board so I'm going to do is I'm going to

---------03:06----------
reattach that resistor I'm going to take

---------03:07----------
it off of another board and after I take

---------03:09----------
it off of another board and put it on

---------03:10----------
there we're going to see if we have

---------03:11----------
pulsing and we're going to see if the

---------03:12----------
battery works and if the battery charges

---------03:18----------
so first things first is to turn on my

---------03:21----------
fume extraction system because I have no

---------03:24----------
plans of getting cancer from soldering

---------03:27----------
the battery indicator connector has seen

---------03:31----------
better days as well might as well

---------03:33----------
measure that resistor while I'm here so

---------03:34----------
I put the multimeter here in resistance

---------03:36----------
mode multimeter in resistance mode we're

---------03:41----------
going to put the probes there so what

---------03:48----------
are the two kilo ohms that's supposed to

---------03:49----------
be that is exactly two kilo ohms why

---------03:52----------
argue with success well let's get some

---------03:58----------
solder I know I know you guys hate when

---------04:01----------
I say solder solder instead of solder I

---------04:05----------
can't say solder it just sounds like

---------04:08----------
such a terrible where they the pads are

---------04:11----------
not really looking very nice so what I

---------04:12----------
do is I just keep moving back and forth

---------04:14----------
with the iron this side are some flux

---------04:17----------
inside of it that's right I said solder

---------04:19----------
I said it again SOI duh

---------04:24----------
it was born in Staten Island you can

---------04:26----------
okay so that pat is nasty so we're just

---------04:29----------
going to rub a little more let's try to

---------04:31----------
get that pad to reappear shall we

---------04:34----------
temperature is not too high on this red

---------04:36----------
740 come on come on oh we're getting

---------04:45----------
somewhere

---------04:45----------
scrape it a little bit without

---------04:46----------
destroying it then send some new in

---------04:49----------
there how are we getting anyone

---------05:06----------
barely damn

---------05:12----------
all right this is going to take a little

---------05:14----------
bit of cleaning you know what I like

---------05:22----------
about the new setup is there's no split

---------05:23----------
for you so you can't see that I just

---------05:25----------
dropped to listen to the alcohol one of

---------05:28----------
them I usually don't like q-tips because

---------05:33----------
they leave crap on the board unless

---------05:35----------
you're really really good at your and

---------05:38----------
rotating it as you go so that it doesn't

---------05:40----------
leave junk on the board because if you

---------05:45----------
don't then this the stuff comes off my

---------05:49----------
brush is in the other room

---------06:15----------
yeah geez I should have just got up and

---------06:18----------
got the brush the reason I'm not I don't

---------06:20----------
really care too much about this is

---------06:21----------
because for these types of repairs this

---------06:25----------
is going to get taken out when it's done

---------06:27----------
and cleaned and put in the ultrasonic

---------06:29----------
anyway and then brushed so there is a

---------06:31----------
cleaning stage so wasting time and that

---------06:32----------
kind of stuff and the diagnosis and

---------06:35----------
trying to fix it stages it brings no

---------06:37----------
returns it's going to try to scratch

---------06:40----------
away until we get a pad here something

---------06:42----------
that we can actually solder to

---------07:01----------
got come out of sleep you little there

---------07:05----------
we go

---------07:11----------
that's not the important one anyway

---------07:13----------
because the that side is not coming off

---------07:15----------
at the data line keep in mind these

---------07:17----------
resistors both come from pp3 b4 to g3

---------07:19----------
hub but on the other side of them are

---------07:21----------
separate data lines if I really needed

---------07:23----------
to I could decide a resistor from there

---------07:24----------
to there I'd be fine

---------07:26----------
just being anal retentive about it for

---------07:28----------
no reason which is a bad habit you know

---------07:33----------
many times I've gone to take something

---------07:35----------
that works perfectly and make it a

---------07:36----------
little more perfect only for it to just

---------07:38----------
never work again for no reason no sense

---------07:40----------
I don't know why there but it's enough

---------07:45----------
times that I should have learned my

---------07:46----------
lesson by now to stuff doing it okay so

---------07:50----------
my good tweezers are not on my desk Wow

---------07:54----------
okay here we go

---------07:55----------
good choices are on the desk I'm going

---------07:57----------
to take that resistor off for the other

---------07:59----------
boy but you're not going to see because

---------08:00----------
I'm not using a microscope for that take

---------08:03----------
that resistor and we are going to fit it

---------08:06----------
on here and do our best to not melt the

---------08:08----------
battery indicator connector those are

---------08:13----------
our soldering tweezers will come in very

---------08:14----------
very handy I just don't have any because

---------08:17----------
I don't work on cell phone boards where

---------08:19----------
they're most often necessary and

---------08:21----------
required

---------08:31----------
you didn't see that so one of those

---------08:35----------
times where I really wish I had it in me

---------08:36----------
to edit the mistakes out I just don't

---------08:38----------
because it's so important to me that you

---------08:40----------
get the message that even idiots can do

---------08:41----------
this that I feel compelled to show you

---------08:44----------
all of the dumb things that I do so you

---------08:47----------
saw that and attempting to actually make

---------08:49----------
it sit on there nicely i melted the

---------08:51----------
resistor right off of the board I mean

---------08:53----------
that was literally a done done fine job

---------08:57----------
that would have worked it would have

---------08:59----------
never come back for years and years and

---------09:00----------
years and but no it wasn't good enough I

---------09:05----------
just had a how to be an idiot and do

---------09:09----------
that little thing to try to make it a

---------09:10----------
little better and it's just not a good

---------09:15----------
habit yeah

---------09:32----------
alright one of the things I really could

---------09:38----------
have done was cover that battery

---------09:39----------
indicator connector in captain tape but

---------09:42----------
something tells me and call me crazy but

---------09:44----------
something tells me based on that and

---------09:46----------
that that I'm going to wind up replacing

---------09:47----------
that thing anyway so if I'm going to be

---------09:50----------
replacing it I don't really care if I

---------09:52----------
burn it yet

---------10:01----------
because that old connector is most

---------10:03----------
likely going to get done in the garbage

---------10:11----------
that's not straight I know make fun

---------10:15----------
looks like it had too much Agra Meister

---------10:18----------
okay here we go to the fun part let's

---------10:21----------
see if this actually works so we're we

---------10:27----------
getting battery this is an H well of a

---------10:43----------
t6 battery for a 2011 and 12 machine but

---------10:46----------
it will still work just fine this the

---------10:48----------
only difference here is added capacity

---------10:53----------
okay so the fan is spinning which as I

---------10:57----------
like the joke very often means that the

---------10:59----------
board is done so we have a fan spinning

---------11:02----------
so usually when it doesn't recognize the

---------11:04----------
battery it won't turn off in the battery

---------11:05----------
at all so the fact that it turns on is

---------11:07----------
good but I'm going to be looking for

---------11:09----------
next is that it actually recognizes the

---------11:11----------
percentage of the battery and let's do

---------11:15----------
that here so they always say I want to

---------11:18----------
show you that the stuff that gets done

---------11:19----------
here actually works if what I do does

---------11:22----------
not work you should not listen to me

---------11:24----------
you should stop listening to me the

---------11:26----------
moment I start showing you things that

---------11:27----------
don't actually work alright I'm going to

---------11:29----------
put it on the desk here and as usual I'm

---------11:30----------
going to zoom out of the name of the

---------11:31----------
person because I'm sick and tired of

---------11:33----------
people doing creepy like look I

---------11:35----------
actually had once one person I had a

---------11:37----------
video that I uploaded that I delete

---------11:39----------
where they saw the name of the person

---------11:41----------
they contacted them on Facebook they

---------11:44----------
said hey look this dude did a video

---------11:45----------
fixing your board but he kept sending

---------11:48----------
the message about you know five or ten

---------11:49----------
times a day look at how cool you are

---------11:50----------
there's a video on look at how cool you

---------11:52----------
add the video on he was just sick

---------11:54----------
so I learned my lesson on there I don't

---------11:55----------
show the user names of anything anymore

---------11:58----------
so the board recognizes a charger it

---------12:01----------
works and runs off of the battery now

---------12:03----------
let's just sit here and see if this

---------12:05----------
actually charges

---------12:10----------
I'm probably going to hit fast forward

---------12:12----------
and up

---------12:12----------
again in Sony Vegas here because I'm

---------12:14----------
going to run out of patience

---------12:19----------
okay we're at 88% now what I'm also

---------12:22----------
going to do here is I want to see the

---------12:24----------
communication between the SMC and the

---------12:26----------
battery and when I actually show that to

---------12:28----------
you on my oscilloscope so to do that I'm

---------12:34----------
going to have to face the camera towards

---------12:36----------
the oscilloscope and manually focus that

---------12:39----------
in so let's see so oscilloscope is a

---------12:46----------
good tripod okay we're going to turn

---------12:50----------
that thing on

---------12:58----------
that's good enough all right now with my

---------13:08----------
desk be without a mess of wires so it

---------13:10----------
sets a 1 volt which is good because this

---------13:12----------
is 3 point 4 volts spikes you probably

---------13:14----------
can't see this because of the lighting

---------13:15----------
but there's a it is a line here a line

---------13:19----------
here a line here and a line at the top

---------13:20----------
so I want to be able to see all the way

---------13:22----------
up to 4 volts on my screen that's

---------13:27----------
pulsing now V top is 3.38 to 4 which is

---------13:31----------
pretty much what I expect you can see

---------13:33----------
I'm not really holding my hand steady

---------13:34----------
when I'm supposed to oh well I know it's

---------13:38----------
time to get new pros well at one point

---------13:39----------
you saw the three point four volts and

---------13:41----------
you saw the square and that's pretty

---------13:43----------
much what it was I was looking for so at

---------13:46----------
least I know now after this I get to go

---------13:48----------
online and spend 50 hundred bucks on new

---------13:50----------
probes for the oscilloscope boom

---------13:54----------
the dinky probe that comes with this is

---------13:56----------
such a piece of crap so I was expecting

---------13:58----------
to have to do that sometime soon anyway

---------14:00----------
so there you go the board itself works

---------14:01----------
it charges the battery it runs off of

---------14:03----------
the battery you got to see the

---------14:06----------
troubleshooting process you got to see

---------14:07----------
the repair of it you got to see that it

---------14:09----------
worked so this was kind of an easy one

---------14:11----------
so I guess it's kind of boring some

---------14:13----------
boards are damaged by water some boards

---------14:16----------
are damaged where you spill something on

---------14:18----------
and it corrodes it some boards are

---------14:19----------
damaged by idiots so somebody prize at

---------14:23----------
something and they rip things off and on

---------14:24----------
rare occasion you have something like

---------14:26----------
this where the board is damaged by both

---------14:27----------
either way was a fairly simple fix
