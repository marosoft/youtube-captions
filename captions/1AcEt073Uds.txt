---------00:00----------
hi today I want to talk about rebuilding

---------00:01----------
very shortly this video is going to get

---------00:04----------
me into a lot of trouble with the people

---------00:06----------
in this business that do what I do for a

---------00:07----------
living because they don't want to hear

---------00:09----------
this a lot of them know it's true but

---------00:11----------
don't really want to believe it or they

---------00:13----------
do actually believe enough in their own

---------00:15----------
[ __ ] that they believe that what I'm

---------00:17----------
saying is false but this is something

---------00:19----------
that you as a customer and even more

---------00:21----------
importantly if you do this as a business

---------00:23----------
that you as a business need to hear

---------00:25----------
before you dig yourself into a miserable

---------00:28----------
miserable hole and ruin your reputation

---------00:30----------
and that is that reball is [ __ ] rhe

---------00:34----------
balling is crap rhe balling is not

---------00:37----------
repair ninety-nine percent of the time

---------00:40----------
I mean ninety-nine percent of the time

---------00:42----------
rhe balling is not repair and there are

---------00:45----------
legitimate uses free balling that I'm

---------00:47----------
going to explain later on in the video

---------00:48----------
but to get my point across right now in

---------00:50----------
the beginning of this video 99% of the

---------00:52----------
time when you hear that somebody is

---------00:54----------
going to fix a laptop by Reeb Alling

---------00:56----------
something they are full of [ __ ] and this

---------01:00----------
is not going to work properly so let's

---------01:02----------
take the 2011 unibody MacBook Pro for

---------01:05----------
example this machine is starting to die

---------01:07----------
and as most defective Apple machines do

---------01:10----------
they are programmed with a little timer

---------01:12----------
inside of them to fail as the user's

---------01:14----------
Apple care is running out and applica is

---------01:16----------
starting to run out on most of these at

---------01:18----------
the moment which is why we're seeing so

---------01:20----------
many of them because a little timer

---------01:21----------
inside that says to die right after the

---------01:23----------
three years of Apple care is up is

---------01:24----------
finally going off and it's kind of like

---------01:26----------
those 2008 machines in 2007 machines

---------01:29----------
that they had where all the graphics

---------01:30----------
chips are dying like crazy

---------01:31----------
it's like 2008 and 7 all over again with

---------01:34----------
the shitty Nvidia chips and a lot of

---------01:37----------
people are asking what the problem is

---------01:39----------
what is the cause of the problem and I'd

---------01:41----------
like to spell it out in this video it's

---------01:43----------
actually a couple of things the first

---------01:45----------
thing above all our shitty chips these

---------01:47----------
chips suck these chips that are coming

---------01:50----------
out by ATI these chips that ATI put out

---------01:52----------
are just as bad as the [ __ ] that Nvidia

---------01:54----------
was putting out in 2008 maybe like one

---------01:57----------
step better but not really secondly as

---------01:59----------
you know most Apple machines in spite of

---------02:02----------
them being marketed to people who do

---------02:04----------
graphics for a living in spite of them

---------02:06----------
being marketed to people who use their

---------02:07----------
computer seriously for a living they

---------02:10----------
have no ventilation holes on the bottom

---------02:12----------
of it so

---------02:13----------
even a $300 piece of garbage PC has all

---------02:16----------
these little vent holes in the bottom so

---------02:17----------
it gets air MacBooks have [ __ ] they have

---------02:21----------
this little exhaust in the back that's

---------02:23----------
just a complete [ __ ] joke they don't

---------02:25----------
have any real debt they don't have real

---------02:26----------
ventilation which is why they run so

---------02:29----------
damn hot and the third problem is the

---------02:31----------
thermal paste anybody who takes apart

---------02:33----------
Apple machines on a regular basis is

---------02:35----------
familiar with that like gray [ __ ] gunky

---------02:37----------
garbage that they call thermal paste

---------02:39----------
again you're paying $2,000 for the

---------02:41----------
machine can you use something that

---------02:44----------
doesn't work like [ __ ] I mean when you

---------02:46----------
clean that stuff and replace it with

---------02:47----------
something good you'll see three six

---------02:49----------
sometimes twelve or fifteen fifteen

---------02:52----------
Celsius drop in temperature when you

---------02:54----------
replace that garbage or something like

---------02:55----------
tunic's here tx4 but again well I spend

---------02:58----------
the extra money on the two thousand

---------03:00----------
dollar machine whatever Apple needs to

---------03:02----------
make money anyway regardless of what the

---------03:04----------
actual issue is causing them to die we

---------03:07----------
have that issue now you have a machine

---------03:09----------
that's dead and now you need to fix it

---------03:11----------
so how are you going to fix it you're

---------03:13----------
gonna see a lot of different options

---------03:14----------
online you're gonna see a lot of

---------03:16----------
different options all across the world

---------03:17----------
for things that you can do to fix it

---------03:18----------
and I'm here to tell you that most of

---------03:20----------
these options suck a lot of them involve

---------03:22----------
something called reball II you've

---------03:24----------
probably heard of reball angry flowing

---------03:26----------
and you don't really know what these

---------03:27----------
things mean because you're to somebody

---------03:29----------
who wants to go back to editing video so

---------03:30----------
they can make money so I'm gonna try to

---------03:32----------
sum it up and make it very very simple

---------03:33----------
for you these chips connect to the board

---------03:36----------
using little little balls of solder it

---------03:39----------
used to be that when you had a chip or

---------03:40----------
CPU that these things were so small and

---------03:43----------
simple that you could just have legs

---------03:44----------
shooting out the side of it and then all

---------03:46----------
those little legs get soldered onto the

---------03:47----------
board and as time went on and devices

---------03:49----------
got smaller and smaller and more

---------03:50----------
complicated you ran out of space to put

---------03:52----------
these connections so what they did is

---------03:54----------
they decided instead of just using the

---------03:55----------
outside of the chip we can actually use

---------03:57----------
the entire chip and put these little

---------04:00----------
balls on so now we can use the entire

---------04:02----------
chip to have connections that go to the

---------04:04----------
board and all of these are in the form

---------04:06----------
of little solder balls that go

---------04:07----------
underneath the chip so these are solder

---------04:09----------
balls that are underneath the chip and a

---------04:11----------
lot of people have been going on and on

---------04:13----------
with this myth this silly myth that the

---------04:16----------
problem with graphics chips failing is

---------04:18----------
that the balls underneath the chip are

---------04:20----------
the cause of the problem and I want to

---------04:22----------
go into why people believe that to be

---------04:23----------
true why people continue to believe that

---------04:25----------
it is true in

---------04:26----------
despite of evidence that it is not true

---------04:28----------
and what the real solution is people

---------04:31----------
believe it to be true because then they

---------04:32----------
replace the balls the chip works again

---------04:34----------
so in order to actually remove the balls

---------04:37----------
from the chip and put new ones on you

---------04:39----------
have to lift the chip off the board

---------04:41----------
soldering requires very very high

---------04:43----------
temperatures so let's say I have this

---------04:44----------
machine over here I'm gonna lift this

---------04:46----------
chip at something like 217 Celsius and

---------04:48----------
I'm gonna put it back on with leaded

---------04:50----------
solder balls that's something like 180

---------04:52----------
Celsius now that's gonna apply a lot of

---------04:54----------
heat to the chip and I'm not actually

---------04:56----------
fixing the chip by replacing the balls

---------04:58----------
but the thing is to replace these solder

---------05:00----------
balls I have to heat the chip and the

---------05:02----------
process of heating the chip is actually

---------05:04----------
what's fixing it I'm fixing this chip by

---------05:06----------
heating it not by replacing the solder

---------05:08----------
balls so the problem in this chip the

---------05:10----------
real true problem is not the solder

---------05:13----------
balls the solder balls are fine and I'm

---------05:15----------
gonna go on to tell you how you can see

---------05:17----------
that for yourself the problem is the

---------05:18----------
actual chip so here you see this little

---------05:21----------
silver part in the top of the chip see

---------05:22----------
if the camera will eventually focus on

---------05:24----------
me see if the camera will focus on my

---------05:27----------
chip

---------05:27----------
come on autofocus I saw you do it before

---------05:30----------
all right so see this silver thing up

---------05:33----------
here that is connecting to the green

---------05:35----------
thing over here through a little bumps

---------05:37----------
inside the chip and then this green

---------05:39----------
thing attaches to the board through

---------05:41----------
solder balls now the problem is that the

---------05:43----------
actual bumps inside of this chip are

---------05:45----------
completely destroyed they're sodomized

---------05:47----------
they they're beat to [ __ ] over a long

---------05:49----------
long periods of time of being heated

---------05:51----------
incredibly with in systems with poor

---------05:53----------
ventilation and again also a lot of

---------05:55----------
these chips they frankly just suck so

---------05:57----------
when you have this combination those of

---------06:00----------
those so when you have those bums get

---------06:02----------
messed up you can actually fix them

---------06:04----------
through heating the chip so when you

---------06:05----------
heat this chip to 200 Celsius you're

---------06:08----------
actually moving around and messing with

---------06:10----------
those little bumps inside the chip

---------06:12----------
itself and that fixes the chip the

---------06:14----------
problem is that the chip itself is dead

---------06:16----------
the chip itself is failing the the

---------06:18----------
entire way for everything inside of here

---------06:20----------
everything how this is set up is just

---------06:22----------
completely falling apart and going to

---------06:24----------
ship and you've just happened to move

---------06:25----------
some of this around by heating it it's

---------06:28----------
kind of like using a piece of wood to

---------06:30----------
hold up a broken wall and then when the

---------06:32----------
wall moves a little bit you just kick

---------06:34----------
the piece of wood and it just so happens

---------06:35----------
to move back into place and keep the

---------06:37----------
wall from falling on you but the problem

---------06:38----------
is the next time that the win

---------06:40----------
blows it's gonna blow your wall back

---------06:41----------
down again you haven't actually fixed

---------06:43----------
the problem you haven't fixed and put a

---------06:45----------
proper wall up with it and you haven't

---------06:46----------
done proper construction you're just

---------06:48----------
holding it up with a piece of wood and

---------06:49----------
the same is true when you heat up a dead

---------06:51----------
chip so the reason people believe that

---------06:53----------
reball ting works the reason they

---------06:54----------
believe the myth that the solder balls

---------06:56----------
are the problem is because when they do

---------06:58----------
this process and they do this reball it

---------07:00----------
actually works again the way to prove

---------07:03----------
this myth wrong the greatest way to

---------07:05----------
prove this myth wrong is to actually

---------07:07----------
measure the temperature while you're

---------07:08----------
heating the chip and stop heating it and

---------07:10----------
around 120 to 140 Celsius

---------07:12----------
now the solder balls that are used to

---------07:15----------
connect this to a laptop motherboard

---------07:16----------
nowadays are lead-free solder balls

---------07:19----------
lead-free solder balls have different

---------07:21----------
melting temperatures depending on the

---------07:22----------
exact alloy used but on average

---------07:24----------
lead-free solder balls melt at 217

---------07:27----------
Celsius I'm telling you to heat the chip

---------07:29----------
up to 120 Celsius that's almost a

---------07:32----------
hundred Celsius less than what you need

---------07:34----------
to actually melt the balls heat it up

---------07:36----------
for five to 15 minutes I would say to be

---------07:39----------
safe like somewhere around the

---------07:40----------
five-minute mark just heat it up put

---------07:42----------
something over here you know buy some

---------07:43----------
cheap-ass little temperature sensor on

---------07:45----------
eBay with a little probe that goes over

---------07:47----------
here put it on there and measure and

---------07:50----------
just keep it at 120 Celsius for what I

---------07:52----------
would say is five minutes of time and

---------07:55----------
what you're gonna see a lot of the times

---------07:56----------
that then 120 150 Celsius mark for five

---------07:58----------
minutes the chip itself is going to work

---------08:00----------
now if the solder balls with a problem

---------08:02----------
that would not have fixed the issue

---------08:04----------
because the solder balls don't melt

---------08:06----------
until 217 but the reason you fixed the

---------08:09----------
issue at 150 is because the issue is not

---------08:11----------
with the solder balls it's inside the

---------08:13----------
chip but nobody wants to believe that

---------08:16----------
and the thing is when you reball this

---------08:18----------
chip you again you have to use a machine

---------08:20----------
like that at 217 Celsius to remove it

---------08:23----------
and then to put it back on with leaded

---------08:25----------
balls you need to use a hundred eighty

---------08:27----------
Celsius which is more than enough to

---------08:28----------
heat up the inside of the chip to fix

---------08:30----------
your problem now let me go into why

---------08:32----------
people like to think that reball is a

---------08:35----------
repair for the issue again as I said

---------08:37----------
they are going to heat the chip up and

---------08:39----------
it's gonna work again they're gonna

---------08:40----------
reball it and it's gonna work again

---------08:42----------
because they heated up the inside of the

---------08:43----------
chips and now they believe it works

---------08:44----------
let's go into why people like to think

---------08:46----------
it works even though it actually doesn't

---------08:48----------
listen people like to believe something

---------08:50----------
if they have a reason to if you have a

---------08:52----------
reason to believe that

---------08:53----------
is true you may believe it even if

---------08:56----------
everything else points otherwise for

---------08:58----------
example I was recently in Las Vegas on

---------09:00----------
vacation we went to this restaurant

---------09:02----------
called Dick's last resort now in the

---------09:05----------
front of Dick's last resort too

---------09:06----------
beautiful I mean his model class women

---------09:09----------
walked up to me and begged me to take a

---------09:11----------
picture with them now if I didn't have

---------09:13----------
all my marbles I may say to myself these

---------09:16----------
women much just like me I miss I always

---------09:18----------
dressed really great today

---------09:19----------
in reality they wanted me to give them

---------09:21----------
$50 for the picture now since I had a

---------09:25----------
brain in my head and I was using my

---------09:26----------
analytical thinking I thought to myself

---------09:29----------
I'm a technician in a cheesy polo shirt

---------09:31----------
with a crappy haircut what the [ __ ] do

---------09:33----------
these two women want with me and I said

---------09:36----------
you know man I'd rather not take a

---------09:38----------
picture and I continued moving on to my

---------09:40----------
table again had I believe this [ __ ] I

---------09:42----------
might have actually had been inclined to

---------09:44----------
pay them for a picture but I didn't pay

---------09:46----------
them for a picture because I used my

---------09:47----------
brain as much as I may want it to be

---------09:50----------
true that two beautiful model class

---------09:52----------
women wanted to spend time with me I

---------09:54----------
think to myself why did these two

---------09:56----------
beautiful half-naked women walk up to me

---------09:58----------
and just start talking to me out of

---------10:00----------
nowhere and the reason is because they

---------10:02----------
wanted $50 you know a lot of the times

---------10:04----------
if you want something to be true you

---------10:06----------
will believe that you'll make it true

---------10:08----------
you'll believe it to be true even when

---------10:09----------
it's not and there were reasons as to

---------10:11----------
why people want this to be true the

---------10:13----------
first is that for a lot of these devices

---------10:15----------
these chips are no longer available

---------10:17----------
so again when somebody walks in with a

---------10:19----------
2006 or 2007 MacBook Pro with an ATI

---------10:22----------
graphics chip a lot of the people

---------10:23----------
believe it or not even though these

---------10:25----------
machines are complete steaming piles of

---------10:26----------
garbage they actually want them fixed

---------10:28----------
they get attached to them if there's

---------10:30----------
anything about Apple products is that it

---------10:31----------
creates loyalty in the user it creates

---------10:33----------
loyalty to keep this thing running as

---------10:35----------
long as humanly possible people forget

---------10:37----------
about the fact that it is a computer and

---------10:39----------
that after a certain amount of time it

---------10:40----------
just becomes a useless piece of crap at

---------10:43----------
the very least laptops two desktops you

---------10:45----------
can continue using for a long time but

---------10:47----------
laptops like you really they don't use

---------10:50----------
standard parts and when certain parts

---------10:51----------
fail you just gotta throw it away and

---------10:53----------
it's hard to explain to the customer

---------10:55----------
it's hard to explain to these people you

---------10:57----------
need to throw this away it's difficult

---------10:59----------
and also above all else it is so

---------11:02----------
hard to not take their money when they

---------11:04----------
want to give it to you it is so hard

---------11:05----------
when they're taking their wallet I'm

---------11:06----------
going I'm willing to pay to tell them

---------11:09----------
there's nothing I can do but the proper

---------11:11----------
thing to do when somebody comes in and

---------11:12----------
you cannot replace their chip with a new

---------11:15----------
one and their chip has failed the proper

---------11:17----------
thing to do is to say I'm sorry I cannot

---------11:20----------
help you I'm sorry your game console is

---------11:23----------
dead I'm sorry you're a 11:50 MacBook

---------11:25----------
Pro is dead but it's hard for people to

---------11:27----------
do this it's hard for people to say I am

---------11:30----------
not only am I not gonna help you

---------11:31----------
I'm not gonna help you and I'm not gonna

---------11:33----------
make money and when they see that

---------11:35----------
there's a solution that works when they

---------11:37----------
see there's a solution that works this

---------11:39----------
fixes the issue I'm gonna make you happy

---------11:41----------
and I'm gonna make money do you think

---------11:43----------
that they're gonna want to read the

---------11:44----------
truth do you think they're gonna want to

---------11:46----------
read an article that talks about why

---------11:47----------
it's the bumps and the chip and not the

---------11:49----------
solder balls do you think they're gonna

---------11:50----------
want to listen to people like me who are

---------11:51----------
telling them that that they're wrong no

---------11:54----------
they have a little solution they've

---------11:56----------
created a little bubble for themselves

---------11:58----------
so they live in this other world they

---------11:59----------
live in this world that defies science

---------12:02----------
where reball indeed graphics chips

---------12:04----------
actually fixes [ __ ] but the problem is

---------12:07----------
that Reeb alling a dead GPU doesn't fix

---------12:09----------
anything and again a lot of I have this

---------12:11----------
argument on a regular basis with people

---------12:13----------
and I'll be honest with you we've done

---------12:16----------
it we've tried it you know again a long

---------12:18----------
time ago it's not you know it's not like

---------12:20----------
I was born with all the knowledge in the

---------12:21----------
world and what I figured out very

---------12:24----------
quickly in the hipster art artist video

---------12:28----------
editing theme capital of the world that

---------12:32----------
is in New York is that you can't get

---------12:34----------
away with you can't get away with reball

---------12:36----------
GPUs no no that [ __ ] does not work and

---------12:39----------
again if you are heating up these chips

---------12:42----------
to make them work again you're giving

---------12:43----------
them back to people who do nothing but

---------12:45----------
Facebook if you're giving them back to

---------12:46----------
people who use their computer once a

---------12:48----------
month if you're getting it back to

---------12:49----------
somebody uses their computer in the

---------12:51----------
morning to check the weather you can get

---------12:53----------
away with that you can but video editing

---------12:56----------
capital of the world I would say that

---------12:59----------
New York City is one of the Mac capitals

---------13:02----------
of the world

---------13:03----------
there are more people here using Mac's

---------13:04----------
for creative purposes than in almost

---------13:06----------
every other area of the world combined I

---------13:09----------
mean you just walk down the street and

---------13:11----------
you see nothing but Apple stuff there

---------13:13----------
are a lot of studios here that use

---------13:15----------
nothing but Apple there are a lot of

---------13:17----------
creative professionals that come to New

---------13:19----------
York to make a living and all these

---------13:20----------
people use nothing but Apple and if you

---------13:23----------
are gonna try to reball graphic strips

---------13:25----------
if you're gonna try to do this [ __ ] and

---------13:26----------
give it back to them they are going to

---------13:28----------
revolt against you and again if a lot of

---------13:31----------
the people who are saying I already Baal

---------13:32----------
and it works just fine I look them up

---------13:34----------
they have one review on Yelp for the 5

---------13:36----------
years they've been in business their

---------13:38----------
business address is their mother's

---------13:39----------
basement

---------13:40----------
and they're in the middle of like Kansas

---------13:43----------
or Iowa and no offense to Kansas or Iowa

---------13:46----------
but again do you have as many creative

---------13:48----------
professionals in these regions yeah and

---------13:51----------
that is densely populated as New York No

---------13:53----------
so you probably didn't again I'm not

---------13:54----------
trying to sit on some high horse you

---------13:56----------
probably just don't have the experience

---------13:58----------
that I do being in this area and doing

---------14:00----------
what I do in this area gives me a level

---------14:02----------
of experience that a lot of people who

---------14:04----------
are even smarter than me who know more

---------14:06----------
than me don't have dealing with these

---------14:08----------
particular products because you probably

---------14:10----------
don't have the volume of creative

---------14:11----------
professionals coming to you with these

---------14:13----------
problems and you probably also don't

---------14:16----------
have to deal with the volume of these

---------14:17----------
creative professionals who come back to

---------14:19----------
you

---------14:19----------
when you give them re-- bald garbage

---------14:23----------
once these things die once these

---------14:25----------
graphics chips die they belong in the

---------14:29----------
garbage and if you miss while you're

---------14:30----------
throwing it in the garbage that doesn't

---------14:31----------
mean that you can reball it that means

---------14:33----------
you just throw it back in the garbage

---------14:35----------
now let me talk about where reball is

---------14:37----------
legitimate Reeb alling is legitimate

---------14:39----------
when the chip itself actually works but

---------14:41----------
you just need to reuse it let's say it's

---------14:43----------
an SMC chip so one great example you

---------14:46----------
can't get new SMC chips to Apple

---------14:48----------
motherboards you need to take them off

---------14:49----------
of another one when you take that chip

---------14:51----------
off the balls are gonna be messed up so

---------14:53----------
you're going to have to reball it and

---------14:55----------
those are not chips with this type of

---------14:56----------
design so this chip has something called

---------14:59----------
a flip chip design flip chip designs are

---------15:01----------
more likely to have this issue with

---------15:04----------
bumps and all this other crap that you

---------15:06----------
can fix when you heat it up than other

---------15:07----------
types of BGA packages now you know Intel

---------15:10----------
CPUs you can reball those there are many

---------15:13----------
times you can reball an Intel

---------15:15----------
Southbridge and that will fix your

---------15:16----------
problem there are many times where the

---------15:18----------
balls are actually the problem because

---------15:20----------
the machine was physically damaged in a

---------15:22----------
way and the balls themselves have

---------15:23----------
actually cracked so you press on the

---------15:25----------
chip and it starts working again but you

---------15:27----------
take your finger off the chip and

---------15:29----------
eyes and you're touching the green part

---------15:31----------
not the top silver part and again there

---------15:36----------
are times where reball egg actually

---------15:37----------
works but 99% of the time I mean 99%

---------15:40----------
when I hear people talking about

---------15:42----------
revolving they are asking me to reball a

---------15:44----------
dead GPU they're telling me that they

---------15:46----------
reball their GPUs and you need to

---------15:49----------
realize this [ __ ] is dead now one of the

---------15:53----------
common things that people tell me is

---------15:55----------
that I well I'm doing it because it's

---------15:57----------
the only solution I'm doing it because I

---------15:59----------
don't want to turn away business and

---------16:00----------
make people mad clearly from your

---------16:02----------
channel you hate customers and you like

---------16:05----------
making people mad and you hate people

---------16:07----------
and you know that's the common [ __ ] that

---------16:08----------
I hear is the common excuse that I hear

---------16:10----------
when I bring up why every balding is

---------16:11----------
[ __ ] let me tell you the truth about

---------16:13----------
dealing with customers let me tell you

---------16:14----------
an honest bit of truth that you need to

---------16:16----------
hear if that's really what you believe

---------16:17----------
when a customer comes in with that a

---------16:19----------
1150 MacBook that they edit video on

---------16:21----------
when they come in with that thing in its

---------16:23----------
dead and you explain to them honestly

---------16:25----------
why you cannot fix it how there are no

---------16:27----------
new chips how the only way to fix it is

---------16:29----------
in a silly myth that is not going to

---------16:32----------
last more than a month or two they are

---------16:34----------
going to hate their computer they are

---------16:37----------
gonna hate that this happened to them

---------16:38----------
they're not gonna be happy they're gonna

---------16:40----------
hate Apple for wanting at 2,000 bucks

---------16:42----------
for a new machine they're gonna hate

---------16:44----------
their boss for demanding that they get

---------16:46----------
the work done when they don't have a

---------16:47----------
working machine they're gonna hate their

---------16:49----------
all their clients that are bitching at

---------16:50----------
them that they need to get this done

---------16:51----------
faster but they're not gonna hate you

---------16:54----------
when you reball their machine and it

---------16:56----------
works again and they hand you that 250

---------16:58----------
or that 350 bucks they're gonna like you

---------17:00----------
they're gonna be happy that you got

---------17:01----------
everything back working but in a month

---------17:03----------
it's gonna fail and then you're gonna

---------17:05----------
fix it again and they're gonna not like

---------17:06----------
you that much and then a month later

---------17:07----------
it's gonna fail again and then you're

---------17:09----------
gonna fix it and they're gonna hate you

---------17:11----------
so if you tell them upfront I cannot fix

---------17:14----------
this here's why they're gonna hate

---------17:15----------
everybody else in the world but that

---------17:17----------
anger is gonna be directed everywhere

---------17:19----------
else but when you decide to fix it

---------17:21----------
because you are weak willed and weak

---------17:23----------
minded and are looking for the quick

---------17:24----------
money up front and are looking to make

---------17:26----------
somebody happy up front without thinking

---------17:28----------
about what's gonna happen down the road

---------17:29----------
they are going to hate you I am in

---------17:33----------
business to keep people happy

---------17:35----------
long term I don't care if they hate me

---------17:37----------
right now I don't care if they hate me

---------17:38----------
one day from now what I want is for them

---------17:41----------
to make the right decision

---------17:42----------
for themselves even if they really hate

---------17:44----------
me as a result of doing it I don't want

---------17:47----------
to do something but they're gonna love

---------17:48----------
me right now but two months from now in

---------17:50----------
the middle of a very important set their

---------17:52----------
[ __ ] just dies I'd rather they hate me

---------17:54----------
I'd rather they hate me and say [ __ ]

---------17:56----------
that computer guy you didn't fix my [ __ ]

---------17:57----------
[ __ ] him I'm giving him a one-star yelp

---------17:59----------
review [ __ ] him he's an [ __ ] I would

---------18:01----------
rather all of that crap and then on and

---------18:04----------
they get something that works for them

---------18:05----------
then for me to do what they asked me to

---------18:08----------
do and then have that thing die on them

---------18:10----------
one month into a set or even worse I fix

---------18:13----------
it and then they sell it to some other

---------18:14----------
poor sucker that doesn't even know that

---------18:15----------
it was repaired and now he has a dead

---------18:17----------
reball GPU out there that just that he

---------18:20----------
uses for live music that dies in the

---------18:22----------
middle of his set that's bad every

---------18:25----------
single choice that you give a customer

---------18:27----------
should be some type of long-term

---------18:28----------
solution to their problem it shouldn't

---------18:31----------
be some sort of short-term [ __ ] with

---------18:33----------
a 30-day warranty
