---------00:00----------
okay I'm going to be working on an eight

---------00:01----------
to zero 2936

---------00:03----------
and the claimed problem is that this

---------00:05----------
board is not charging the battery so

---------00:07----------
let's go over a couple of things that

---------00:08----------
I'm going to look at first here so the

---------00:10----------
first thing that I always say to look at

---------00:11----------
if it doesn't see the battery you have

---------00:13----------
to look at data line so you have to look

---------00:15----------
at the SMC the battery charger talking

---------00:17----------
to the SMC so one of the things that I

---------00:19----------
would look at if it didn't see the

---------00:20----------
battery if it that would mean that the

---------00:23----------
SMC is not communicating with it the way

---------00:25----------
it's supposed to so I would look at

---------00:27----------
something around here let me just bring

---------00:29----------
it up on the schematic so that you can

---------00:30----------
see what it is I am talking about okay

---------00:39----------
come on PDF reader don't be an [ __ ]

---------00:54----------
so that's the SMC chip right there and

---------00:58----------
this is where you can see data line so

---------01:01----------
you have the SMC talking to the battery

---------01:03----------
charger in the battery so I'd start

---------01:04----------
troubleshooting that and I've talked

---------01:06----------
about how to troubleshoot data lines and

---------01:07----------
what to do when you're back book is not

---------01:09----------
charging the battery you're not seeing

---------01:11----------
the battery all of this has been

---------01:12----------
discussed in a previous video now one of

---------01:15----------
the things that I want to look at here

---------01:17----------
is current sensing so it sees the

---------01:19----------
battery it just refuses to charge it so

---------01:21----------
for that I'm going to look at current

---------01:22----------
sensing and I've also discussed what

---------01:24----------
current sensing is in a different video

---------01:25----------
so you can search for current sensing

---------01:27----------
and you will find many videos that I've

---------01:29----------
done on them now the current sensing

---------01:30----------
that I'm going to want to check here is

---------01:32----------
going to be make sure it's recording

---------01:34----------
right this is current sensing for the

---------01:35----------
charger so this is where the charger

---------01:37----------
comes into the machine if a 0.02 ohm

---------01:39----------
shunt resistor over here and then two

---------01:41----------
resistors on each side of the shunt

---------01:42----------
resistor that report voltage to the

---------01:44----------
il-62 5:9 the voltage drop across the

---------01:46----------
shunt resistor is going to be dependent

---------01:47----------
on how much power the system is using so

---------01:49----------
the system is using a lot of power

---------01:50----------
you'll be a bigger voltage drop than if

---------01:52----------
the system is using no power now the

---------01:54----------
reason that this is important is it

---------01:56----------
allows this chip that is not actually in

---------01:58----------
the circuit like it with in it right now

---------02:01----------
to tell how much power the system is

---------02:04----------
using if it's using too much power

---------02:05----------
obviously turn the charger off same is

---------02:07----------
true for the battery you have a shunt

---------02:08----------
resistor right by the two front battery

---------02:10----------
line over here and then you have two

---------02:12----------
resistors over here that report that

---------02:13----------
information back to the United you seven

---------02:16----------
thousand chips so one in front of that

---------02:17----------
resistor and one on the back of that

---------02:18----------
resistor so let's check those current

---------02:20----------
sensing resistors and see what we get

---------02:22----------
and see if this is working the way that

---------02:24----------
it should

---------02:25----------
so okay got my nice rubber fluke

---------02:33----------
multimeter here just pointed okay so for

---------02:37----------
the charger current sensing resistors

---------02:39----------
that the schematics is supposed to be 10

---------02:40----------
ohms I get ten point one that is

---------02:47----------
absolutely fine

---------02:49----------
do not play step because it's ten point

---------02:51----------
one instead of ten the other one I get

---------02:53----------
10 now let's look at the resistors well

---------02:56----------
in nine point eight is that's good

---------02:58----------
enough nine point here we go the other

---------03:00----------
two this is supposed to be it I think

---------03:02----------
2.2 or something like that and I get

---------03:05----------
good and the next one which

---------03:08----------
supposed to be zero and at the zero ohm

---------03:10----------
resister I get that ain't zero that's

---------03:19----------
not zero all right let's see if we found

---------03:23----------
our problem so now we got to find a

---------03:26----------
donor board from which to steal that

---------03:27----------
 from a donor board where I haven't

---------03:34----------
stolen that already yeah good luck with

---------03:36----------
that good luck with that okay

---------03:46----------
of course I have stolen everything so

---------03:50----------
let's see I should also plug this camera

---------03:52----------
they plan on using it in a few okay so

---------03:56----------
on this board here let's rip off that

---------04:00----------
under feel like that's by the

---------04:02----------
component right next to it and let's see

---------04:06----------
what I get so on a board that's working

---------04:08----------
the way it's supposed to that resistor

---------04:10----------
measures C move away all the underfill

---------04:12----------
stuff and I get hmm am I making contact

---------04:22----------
I'm not making contact because I'm

---------04:26----------
touching the underfill not the resistor

---------04:29----------
 right okay so I'm going to

---------04:37----------
clean that junk off

---------04:44----------
and the data that the town this is

---------05:05----------
oh it's not about underfill it's

---------05:06----------
probably that resistor is destroyed

---------05:08----------
let's see yo I might even using this

---------05:16----------
board that resistant doesn't even have

---------05:17----------
metal caps anymore on this each side of

---------05:20----------
it goodbye

---------05:20----------
oh my donor boys are bullish that

---------05:24----------
board is a one how about you

---------05:28----------
know you've been stolen already here

---------05:34----------
donor boy that's not Jesus ha

---------05:49----------
all right so on this one over here Dada

---------05:57----------
see it's supposed to be zero not

---------05:59----------
30-something so let's replace that thing

---------06:01----------
and see what we get

---------06:20----------
whoops that's what it's going to

---------06:25----------
pretend that every day I didn't just do

---------06:27----------
that nobody oh okay goodbye resistor

---------06:35----------
that is not measuring how it's supposed

---------06:37----------
to ten pads what get off of there

---------06:52----------
okay

---------07:13----------
I want to touch that ship next to it

---------07:14----------
because I'm pretty sure it's important

---------07:16----------
that I not reflow it okay so now what I

---------07:18----------
want to do is I want to test this and

---------07:19----------
see if it sees the battery charges the

---------07:21----------
battery and does all that good stuff

---------07:22----------
that it's supposed to also another thing

---------07:24----------
to know is that malfunctions in that

---------07:26----------
area do actually cause quarter fan spin

---------07:28----------
and quarter fan spin is one of those

---------07:29----------
miserable things that has 50 different

---------07:32----------
causes so it's great to know every

---------07:38----------
single potential solution a quarter fan

---------07:41----------
spin the quarter fan spin sucks oh look

---------07:51----------
this board actually has a sticker on it

---------07:53----------
from another company that fixes boards

---------07:55----------
okay that's my key that's my that's my

---------07:59----------
answer key that this is not going to be

---------08:00----------
a fun one let's see if it sees the

---------08:08----------
battery and charges it now

---------08:11----------
hopefully there's boots up quickly

---------08:13----------
because I see an SSD inside the computer

---------08:15----------
I have honestly gotten so impatient with

---------08:19----------
this that a lot of the times if I see

---------08:20----------
like that a customer has a machine with

---------08:22----------
some three-year-old piece of

---------08:24----------
spinning Samsung hard drive inside of it

---------08:27----------
that I just I'll take the time to grab

---------08:29----------
mine because I can grab my drive in

---------08:31----------
Budapest err then I can just wait for

---------08:33----------
their crap to boot once you use an SSD

---------08:37----------
it's like I don't even think honestly

---------08:38----------
SATA SATA 3 SSDs I don't even see that

---------08:40----------
as like a big speed increase it's like

---------08:49----------
an SI that's just standard to me like a

---------08:51----------
regular SATA 3 SSD is standard a PCI

---------08:53----------
Express SSD is fast and the hard drive

---------08:56----------
is just this is unusable I mean

---------09:00----------
it's fine for storage or you know watch

---------09:04----------
movies or television on but to actually

---------09:09----------
use a computer and load software and do

---------09:11----------
things with it oh no in people will

---------09:17----------
say like we've used them for so long so

---------09:19----------
how do you say it's unusable now I mean

---------09:21----------
how long do people use 33 K modems for

---------09:23----------
and 56k modems and ISDN lines for like

---------09:25----------
you got by with it

---------09:26----------
you used it I remember downloading the

---------09:29----------
movie deep-blue using my 56k 56k

---------09:33----------
earthling connection a long time ago

---------09:35----------
sure as hell doesn't mean I'm going to

---------09:37----------
do it by choice now you know I

---------09:40----------
acknowledge that it's sucked at the time

---------09:42----------
and I think the hard drive sucked even

---------09:45----------
from 2002 when I got my first

---------09:49----------
quote-unquote real laptop okay so I got

---------09:58----------
an orange light in the charger so this

---------09:59----------
is a start to the orange light there

---------10:01----------
tells me that there's hope that this

---------10:03----------
actually works

---------10:15----------
guests

---------10:19----------
okay so the guest account on this is

---------10:20----------
blocked and it has a password so great

---------10:23----------
this is what I get from mentioning that

---------10:25----------
 I'm going to have to boot up off of

---------10:28----------
another Drive anyway you see that it's

---------10:33----------
charging okay oh I got a firewire

---------10:37----------
enclosure and my drive restart

---------10:50----------
option please tell me this board is fire

---------10:59----------
that works

---------11:00----------
I saw a particular company's warranty

---------11:04----------
sticker that leads me to believe that I

---------11:05----------
may not be seeing fire wire there's a

---------11:12----------
particular warranty sigil that when I

---------11:14----------
see it something tells me that I may be

---------11:17----------
missing eye out ports

---------11:32----------
and this board seems to be now

---------11:34----------
different okay try one more time before

---------11:41----------
I grab a USB cable

---------11:57----------
okay it I grabbed a USB cable

---------12:13----------
my

---------12:14----------
slow useless worthless USB too so not

---------12:26----------
only do another firewire but we only

---------12:27----------
have one USB port on this board and this

---------12:30----------
is one of those things where I honestly

---------12:32----------
really probably would look into why that

---------12:35----------
is if this boy didn't have the sticker

---------12:37----------
of the company that you guys probably

---------12:40----------
know where it came from

---------12:41----------
on there but since it does I got my eye

---------12:45----------
I can like I feel bad but just don't

---------12:54----------
bring your board there before you bring

---------12:56----------
it here if you wanted to actually work

---------12:58----------
okay so before we were at battery level

---------13:02----------
zero percent now we're at three percent

---------13:05----------
might as well show you that it says it's

---------13:07----------
charging

---------13:20----------
say that you're charging

---------13:33----------
okay fine you'd be a pain in the ass and

---------13:35----------
take forever so I'm going to zoom in on

---------13:38----------
that with the camcorder right now so

---------13:39----------
that you can see it this battery had no

---------13:44----------
charge in it at all and now if I unplug

---------13:47----------
the power adapter it stays on because it

---------13:51----------
does have power in the battery not a lot

---------13:53----------
but enough that you can see that it

---------13:55----------
works all right so just to recap what we

---------13:57----------
did to make this work let me just go

---------13:59----------
back to the viewer you can see what's

---------14:00----------
going on on the screen the current

---------14:03----------
sensing for the charger was not working

---------14:04----------
so show you that this is to and from the

---------14:08----------
battery and over here you have a current

---------14:13----------
sensing shunt resistor and this shunt

---------14:16----------
resistor over here the whole idea behind

---------14:17----------
it is you can have a small voltage drop

---------14:19----------
across the shunt resistor and the

---------14:20----------
voltage drop across that shunt resistor

---------14:22----------
is going to go up or go down depending

---------14:24----------
on how much amperage the system is using

---------14:26----------
there are two resistors that go from

---------14:28----------
each side of this shunt resistor to the

---------14:29----------
is l6 to 5/9 chip and so that the is l6

---------14:33----------
to 5/9 can do whatever calculation is

---------14:35----------
necessary to figure out how much

---------14:36----------
amperage is the battery is applying to

---------14:39----------
the machine and this resistor over here

---------14:43----------
the zero ohm one was blown so instead of

---------14:46----------
being zero ohms it was going up to 39

---------14:48----------
ohms the multimeter was continuing to

---------14:49----------
count I just took it off because I know

---------14:51----------
that 39 is not zero and after replacing

---------14:54----------
that the Machine charges the battery and

---------14:56----------
all as well again it doesn't have fire

---------14:58----------
wire and it's missing a USB port at the

---------15:00----------
moment then I know exactly why because

---------15:03----------
of the warranty sticker that's on the

---------15:04----------
machine I know who fixed it I know what

---------15:06----------
they did and I hate to say it as much as

---------15:09----------
I like to go above and beyond and make

---------15:10----------
these boards work as best as buing ly

---------15:12----------
possible in this case I just know that's

---------15:14----------
going to be a nightmare so I'm done
