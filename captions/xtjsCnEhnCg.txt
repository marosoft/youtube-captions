---------00:00----------
you've got a MacBook a 1706 that has no

---------00:02----------
backlight let's just take a look and see

---------00:04----------
what it is they said was wrong with this

---------00:06----------
machine so I'm gonna look up their

---------00:08----------
ticket and over here in their ticket

---------00:10----------
information it says we took it to a Mac

---------00:12----------
authorized dealer and they tested the

---------00:14----------
fuse in our board that is responsible

---------00:16----------
for backlight and found that to be the

---------00:17----------
issue they said we needed to replace the

---------00:20----------
main logic board the display does not

---------00:22----------
work but it seems to turn on I spoke

---------00:23----------
with someone from your with your team

---------00:24----------
over the phone they said you could fix

---------00:26----------
it now there's two things here that

---------00:27----------
strike me as odd the first thing that

---------00:29----------
strikes me as odd is that they said the

---------00:32----------
fuse was the issue with the board and I

---------00:35----------
don't think that the fuse is the issue

---------00:37----------
with the board so if we take a look over

---------00:38----------
here I'm gonna open up the board view

---------00:40----------
application for you all what's going on

---------00:42----------
here is this is a current sensing

---------00:44----------
circuit so over here you have a resistor

---------00:46----------
right after the fuse and this resistor

---------00:49----------
is gonna have a really small voltage

---------00:50----------
drop across it very small but that

---------00:51----------
voltage drop is going to be dependent

---------00:53----------
and directly related to the amount of

---------00:56----------
current the system is using so [ __ ] for

---------00:58----------
the resistor and after the resistor

---------00:59----------
we've got a trace going to the LED

---------01:01----------
driver so the LED driver is gonna be

---------01:02----------
able to tell the voltage difference from

---------01:04----------
the beginning of the resistors at the

---------01:05----------
end and therefore it's gonna be able to

---------01:06----------
calculate the current that it's taking

---------01:08----------
so if you ever have an issue where

---------01:11----------
there's a short-circuit or there was too

---------01:13----------
much current being taken rather than the

---------01:15----------
fuse blowing on all these machines the

---------01:17----------
current cent circuit is going to say

---------01:18----------
you're taking too much we're turning the

---------01:20----------
entire system off and that is a pretty

---------01:22----------
nice design but what that means is that

---------01:25----------
the backlight fuse on these is never

---------01:27----------
going to blow ever and I'll show it to

---------01:31----------
you right now so we're gonna find F 8400

---------01:33----------
on our board view diagram here software

---------01:36----------
done by paul daniels at PL daniels calm

---------01:38----------
don't delay

---------01:39----------
check out all daniels at PL daniels

---------01:42----------
dot-com for all your software an

---------01:45----------
australian macbook repair needs so as

---------01:47----------
you can see over here the backlight fuse

---------01:49----------
is gonna be located right in this little

---------01:51----------
section of the board right over here and

---------01:54----------
I'm gonna unplug power because remember

---------01:56----------
you never want to have power plugged in

---------01:58----------
when you test such things we're gonna

---------01:59----------
put the voltammeter to resistance mode

---------02:00----------
and we're gonna see what the backlight

---------02:02----------
for use measures as you can see the

---------02:05----------
backlight fuses 0.3 ohms which means the

---------02:07----------
fuse is working just fine which means

---------02:10----------
that the Mac authorised dealer was

---------02:12----------
wrong so now what we're gonna do is try

---------02:17----------
and figure out why it is that we have no

---------02:19----------
backlight on this machine so first thing

---------02:21----------
I'm gonna do is see if there's a short

---------02:23----------
to ground on backlight out 105 ohms

---------02:26----------
that's actually fairly low that's not a

---------02:28----------
full short circuit to ground but it is

---------02:30----------
far worse than what I would expect so

---------02:33----------
now what we're gonna do is we're going

---------02:34----------
to unplug the screen and see if the

---------02:37----------
short goes away at all so we're gonna

---------02:39----------
check back light output again 107 ohms

---------02:42----------
so it's not the screen nor the screen

---------02:44----------
cable nor the backlight that's short it

---------02:46----------
might check the output which is over

---------02:47----------
here so I can check on any one of these

---------02:48----------
capacitors and I can see what the

---------02:50----------
resistance the ground is now we're gonna

---------02:51----------
just take the board out of the case and

---------02:53----------
see what it looks like once the board is

---------02:55----------
out of the case I'm just kind of curious

---------02:57----------
how many of you that are watching the

---------02:58----------
stream out there in YouTube chat land

---------03:01----------
and twitch chat lands at Vimeo how many

---------03:03----------
of you are surprised and taken aback

---------03:05----------
that the Mac authorized dealer said

---------03:08----------
something was the problem that was not

---------03:09----------
the problem now they said something else

---------03:11----------
as well which is that you'd have to

---------03:13----------
replace this whole thing so let's see if

---------03:14----------
they're right about that as well now one

---------03:16----------
of the things that's strange about what

---------03:17----------
it is they prescribed is they said that

---------03:20----------
it's just it's the fuse that's bad but

---------03:22----------
you have to replace the board I mean

---------03:24----------
that that's it's wrong but it's wrong in

---------03:26----------
very strange ways a if the problem is

---------03:28----------
just a fuse you shouldn't have to

---------03:30----------
replace the entire board for that

---------03:31----------
because it's just the fuse right and B

---------03:33----------
well it wasn't actually the fuse I mean

---------03:36----------
if you said that there's an issue with

---------03:38----------
the backlight circuit because there's a

---------03:39----------
big hole in the board then that's fine

---------03:43----------
it's very interesting because if you

---------03:45----------
were wrong about the fact that it's just

---------03:46----------
a fuse then you should at least be wrong

---------03:48----------
that you should be right about the fact

---------03:50----------
that it's easy to fix but to be wrong

---------03:53----------
about both at the same time is just

---------03:55----------
fairly interesting to me it's that level

---------03:58----------
of silliness is something that I've

---------04:00----------
don't even expect from Apple at this

---------04:03----------
point all right usually our issue is

---------04:05----------
gonna be a backlight output capacitor

---------04:06----------
but these all look fine take a look at

---------04:10----------
the ones on the other side

---------04:18----------
those all look fine as well so one of

---------04:23----------
the things that I would do at this point

---------04:24----------
is put some power into backlight outfit

---------04:27----------
remember backlight output can take up to

---------04:28----------
52 volts which means fun so we are gonna

---------04:31----------
put some power in there and see what

---------04:32----------
gets warm

---------04:36----------
[Music]

---------04:45----------
tonight thank you

---------04:55----------
all right putting out 5 amps at a 1 volt

---------04:59----------
most common issue with back light output

---------05:02----------
is gonna be something around the

---------05:03----------
backlight capacitors oh there we go

---------05:07----------
so it's something over here you hear

---------05:10----------
that sizzling yeah this is where them

---------05:12----------
that hopefully this is 11 switched over

---------05:14----------
to the other DPA because I've not had

---------05:16----------
time to yet but I'm gonna take my mom

---------05:19----------
need errection almight put it up there

---------05:20----------
and let's see if you could hear this

---------05:27----------
headphone listeners alert

---------05:32----------
hey yeah it's me

---------05:36----------
ASMR part repair okay I'm gonna put the

---------05:45----------
microphone around the board and I'm

---------05:47----------
gonna put some alcohol on it and we're

---------05:50----------
gonna see what works here so I'm gonna

---------05:56----------
turn off power to the port there's no

---------05:58----------
power going through to the board right

---------06:00----------
now there's no power going through the

---------06:04----------
board right now

---------06:11----------
okay now I'm gonna turn the power on in

---------06:15----------
just a second

---------06:24----------
hey it's me that's short on the board

---------06:29----------
okay now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

---------06:34----------
turn on the power and we're gonna see

---------06:36----------
which of these capacitors is the one

---------06:38----------
that blows up

---------06:52----------
and looks like it to the middle line

---------06:53----------
that's the blame

---------07:04----------
as one or this one

---------07:09----------
hi that's me you're a short circuit well

---------07:13----------
I can't tell which one of these is my

---------07:15----------
short circuit so I'm just gonna take out

---------07:17----------
all I'm feeling in a this destructive

---------07:21----------
mood tonight so I am going to maul these

---------07:24----------
capacitors off with this ridiculous

---------07:26----------
soldering tip this is absolute savagery

---------07:30----------
if you're not gonna snitch and tell me

---------07:33----------
which of the capacitors is bad then you

---------07:35----------
all must go

---------07:40----------
that's right you don't want to snitch

---------07:42----------
you don't want to make it clear which

---------07:43----------
capacitor is the bad one you're all

---------07:47----------
gonna get it oh look at that

---------07:50----------
btfo that's all good

---------07:57----------
it feels really powerful using this tip

---------08:00----------
it's like driving a smart car your whole

---------08:03----------
life and then being handed a tank

---------08:05----------
there's just fun stuff you're gonna want

---------08:07----------
to do with it and this is one of them

---------08:09----------
for the power it's too much power

---------08:35----------
let that be a lesson to you

---------08:37----------
short-circuited capacitors that you

---------08:39----------
should just snitch out the one that's

---------08:41----------
bad

---------08:41----------
you should have snitched now y'all go in

---------08:44----------
any waste what you get dry off the

---------08:51----------
alcohol over here

---------09:19----------
[Music]

---------09:30----------
[Music]

---------10:09----------
[Music]

---------10:30----------
watch all these caps flow into place is

---------10:32----------
that not beautiful now we're gonna see

---------10:36----------
if we get anything on the screen when we

---------10:38----------
turn it on so we got the mat over here

---------10:41----------
under the machine I'm gonna move the

---------10:44----------
fume extractor out of the way we're

---------10:45----------
gonna plug in this USBC amp meter and

---------10:48----------
see what happens do we get back light or

---------10:51----------
back smoke what do you know an Apple

---------11:00----------
logo we have an Apple logo on this

---------11:03----------
macbook it's clearly visible which means

---------11:05----------
that we fixed it when this individual

---------11:07----------
went to the Mac authorized dealer what

---------11:09----------
they were told is that a the fuse was

---------11:12----------
bad and B the entire board had to be

---------11:14----------
replaced what was actually wrong with it

---------11:17----------
is that the fuse was fine but there was

---------11:19----------
a short to ground on backlight output

---------11:21----------
due to a bad capacitor a capacitor is

---------11:23----------
not a fuse and you do not have to

---------11:25----------
replace the board to replace a bad

---------11:27----------
capacitor for shits and giggles I

---------11:29----------
decided to be kind of a dumbass and

---------11:32----------
scrape all the capacitors off because I

---------11:33----------
was having fun with my extra wide tip

---------11:35----------
it's always fun to have fun with your

---------11:37----------
extra wide tip ever from time to time on

---------11:39----------
Friday night and I just decided to knock

---------11:41----------
all them off and but I really could have

---------11:43----------
just gotten by by replacing one but at

---------11:46----------
the end of the day the issue with this

---------11:47----------
machine was not a bad fuse it was a

---------11:49----------
capacitor even if the Apple authorized

---------11:51----------
dealer was correct and it was simply a

---------11:53----------
bad fuse why would you actually tell the

---------11:55----------
customer that you have to replace the

---------11:57----------
entire board because of a fuse it

---------11:59----------
doesn't make sense

---------12:00----------
usually it's well this is really

---------12:02----------
complicated and hard that's why we're we

---------12:05----------
have to replace the board but actually

---------12:07----------
admit that the issue is a fuse but that

---------12:09----------
you can't fix it it really doesn't make

---------12:11----------
a damn bit of sense like most of the

---------12:13----------
stories that my customers come here with

---------12:14----------
like most the diagnosis is that they get

---------12:17----------
from the Genius Bar but such as life

---------12:19----------
this machine works I'm gonna ultrasonic

---------12:22----------
the board clean off all the flux and all

---------12:24----------
that reassemble it test it make sure

---------12:25----------
everything's good send it back to them

---------12:27----------
and another happy customer but don't

---------12:29----------
touch that dial because we've got to

---------12:31----------
talk to you today about some more

---------12:32----------
products from store dot Rossman

---------12:34----------
group.com drawer dot Rossman group comm

---------12:36----------
is this businesses one and only sponsor

---------12:39----------
at door dot Ross McRib comm you can buy

---------12:41----------
tools like the eye socket

---------12:43----------
the eye socket allows you to check an

---------12:45----------
iPhone 10 board that you're working on

---------12:47----------
without having to resolder the entire

---------12:48----------
thing back together with the iPhone 10

---------12:50----------
the board is soldered together in a very

---------12:52----------
pain in the ass fashion but this tool

---------12:54----------
allows you to take a known good iPhone

---------12:57----------
10 bottom board and have it run with the

---------13:00----------
top board that you're working on without

---------13:01----------
having to solder everything back

---------13:03----------
together if it's well it's gonna save

---------13:05----------
you a lot of time in addition to that

---------13:07----------
we've got the iPhone eye bridge test

---------13:09----------
cable the eye bridge allows you to get

---------13:11----------
multimeter readings when you have your

---------13:13----------
board plugged in with a test screen

---------13:14----------
camera etc and is available for the six

---------13:16----------
six plus success success plus seven

---------13:20----------
seven plus and more further if you've

---------13:23----------
ever had an issue whether you needed to

---------13:24----------
conformal code something because you

---------13:26----------
didn't want two things touching or there

---------13:27----------
as a pad under a chip and either whether

---------13:30----------
the trace had the solder mask knocked

---------13:32----------
off of it you need to re-insulate it

---------13:33----------
well check out our ly UV h 900 conformal

---------13:38----------
coating solder mask at store Osman group

---------13:40----------
comm now for a limited time only we've

---------13:43----------
actually got the laser pointer pen in

---------13:45----------
stock that goes with it at a low low

---------13:47----------
price of $7.99 plus $5.99 on the

---------13:54----------
mechanics conformal coating and solder

---------13:56----------
mask you can have a setup that allows

---------13:57----------
you to insulate small parts of the board

---------14:00----------
from other parts of the board when

---------14:01----------
you're soldering and that solder mask is

---------14:03----------
heat resistant once you UV it in place

---------14:05----------
it's not gonna spread around because you

---------14:07----------
put hot air on it it's awesome it's

---------14:09----------
amazing and it's sold only at store dot

---------14:12----------
rossmann group comm and probably a

---------14:14----------
hundred 1000 other websites if you want

---------14:17----------
to buy it from us right you want to buy

---------14:19----------
it from us it's a great decision that's

---------14:21----------
it for today and as always I hope you

---------14:23----------
learned something

---------14:53----------
excellent data recovery not the best

---------14:56----------
camera

---------15:01----------
what happened Steve what do you think is

---------15:08----------
gonna happen if you're something that

---------15:09----------
hits a meter run through it you push
