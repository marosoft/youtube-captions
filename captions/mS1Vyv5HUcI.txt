---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm going to be going over

---------00:01----------
the concept of drying out your machine

---------00:03----------
after liquid damage so a very very

---------00:05----------
common question that I get whether it's

---------00:08----------
with a laptop or a cell phone or any

---------00:10----------
type of electronics is you know should I

---------00:13----------
dry it out do you recommend I wait for

---------00:15----------
it to dry out before trying it again and

---------00:18----------
what I want to go over in this video is

---------00:20----------
that drying out the machine is not going

---------00:22----------
to do anything in fact the machine

---------00:24----------
drying off is very much so what you

---------00:27----------
don't want to happen so I want to show

---------00:29----------
you that under the microscope so this is

---------00:31----------
somebody who decided I'm going to turn

---------00:33----------
my computer upside down I'm going to put

---------00:35----------
it by by that by the heating unit and

---------00:37----------
I'm going to not turn it on for a month

---------00:40----------
I'm going to wait for it to dry out

---------00:41----------
before I use it again and what you'll

---------00:43----------
see is that it did indeed dry out they

---------00:46----------
did get the machine dried out but I want

---------00:48----------
to show you what dried out actually

---------00:49----------
means under the microscope so if I

---------00:52----------
search under the microscope over here

---------00:54----------
let me show you what you are going to

---------00:56----------
find this so there's no liquid there

---------01:01----------
there's nothing there that's still wet

---------01:02----------
it did indeed dry out and what do you

---------01:05----------
think how do you think this device is

---------01:07----------
going to work would you feel comfortable

---------01:09----------
passing electricity through something

---------01:12----------
that looks like this if your answer is

---------01:13----------
no that is a very good answer it did

---------01:18----------
indeed dry out this is dried out but

---------01:20----------
again do you want to use this that would

---------01:23----------
be a very very very bad idea

---------01:26----------
again if you touch this you won't feel

---------01:28----------
anything wet but look what you're

---------01:30----------
worried about it's not necessarily the

---------01:33----------
it's not necessarily the liquid itself

---------01:36----------
it's the minerals and junk and sugar and

---------01:39----------
and fluoride and whatever other horse

---------01:42----------
crap is included in the in the water in

---------01:45----------
the coffee in the beer in the coca-cola

---------01:47----------
that you drank it's not necessarily the

---------01:50----------
actual water and what you'll also notice

---------01:53----------
is that it gets under the chips so a lot

---------01:56----------
of people will say you know can you just

---------01:58----------
clean that and they'll grab a q-tip or a

---------01:59----------
tweezers or whatever and they'll start

---------02:01----------
doing this and this is not really going

---------02:03----------
to do much of anything this type of

---------02:05----------
quote-unquote cleaning because very

---------02:07----------
often when people ask me to clean their

---------02:08----------
stuff they have this idea that it's a

---------02:10----------
that it's a process that takes about two

---------02:12----------
minutes

---------02:13----------
and that it's just brushing off what you

---------02:15----------
can see in fact the issue is that is not

---------02:18----------
what you can see it's what you can't see

---------02:20----------
so you can see the stuff around the

---------02:22----------
chips over here but what you can't see

---------02:24----------
just get the this adjusted what you can

---------02:27----------
see is what's actually under the chip so

---------02:30----------
as you can see this is a chip that has

---------02:32----------
several balls that attach it to the

---------02:33----------
motherboard and over here all the way to

---------02:36----------
the right you can see how one of those

---------02:37----------
balls is completely demolished so you

---------02:40----------
can brush the top of it all you want you

---------02:42----------
can do all you want with traditional

---------02:44----------
cleaning it's not going to get under

---------02:46----------
that you can't clean the crud from

---------02:48----------
underneath the chip and further waiting

---------02:51----------
for it to dry out has no positive effect

---------02:53----------
on getting rid of corrosion what you

---------02:56----------
need to do is get this thing out of the

---------02:57----------
machine put it into an ultrasonic

---------03:00----------
cleaner and then go from there so I'm

---------03:02----------
going to show you how that works the

---------03:04----------
first thing I'm going to do just because

---------03:05----------
this has a flickering backlight and I

---------03:07----------
don't want to trust the eye see that's

---------03:09----------
there even though this I see probably

---------03:11----------
would work if I were floated what I'm

---------03:13----------
going to do here even though this may

---------03:14----------
very well work out of the cleaner is I'm

---------03:16----------
going to give this I see a reflow with

---------03:18----------
some flux before I actually put it in

---------03:20----------
the cleaner so that you can see and I'm

---------03:22----------
using too much flux which is standard

---------03:24----------
flux is something that allows solder to

---------03:25----------
flow and it might just help revive the

---------03:28----------
connection it's faulty so as you can see

---------03:30----------
the ball that corroded is the feedback

---------03:33----------
ball it's the one all the way on the

---------03:34----------
right that always it's always the one I

---------03:36----------
corrode in this particular circuit and

---------03:40----------
let's see what we can do so I have my

---------03:43----------
hot air station turned on I got my air

---------03:45----------
filter turned on I'm going to slowly

---------03:48----------
preheat the area and then I'm going to

---------03:51----------
reflow this chip before I throw it in

---------03:54----------
the cleaner again you could always

---------03:56----------
replace it but what I want to do in this

---------03:58----------
video is I just want to show you the

---------03:59----------
difference before and after while using

---------04:01----------
the same components when it goes through

---------04:04----------
a proper cleaning versus a drying out

---------04:07----------
because you saw it drying out does too

---------04:09----------
this drying out does nothing

---------04:23----------
and I totally realize that you know the

---------04:26----------
average home user does not have an

---------04:28----------
ultrasonic cleaner don't get it wrong I

---------04:30----------
understand that completely it's just a

---------04:31----------
lot of people think I'm making up

---------04:34----------
when I say that drying stuff out is not

---------04:36----------
going to do anything or that I'm being a

---------04:39----------
salesman and I'm making this up and

---------04:42----------
so I figured I would show you with a

---------04:44----------
video like I'm not making this up this

---------04:46----------
is indeed the reality so I'm just going

---------04:48----------
to do this move it around and now we're

---------04:51----------
going to toss it in the cleaner and once

---------04:52----------
it comes out of the cleaner I want to

---------04:54----------
show you what it looks like and I want

---------04:55----------
to show you what it works

---------04:56----------
I mean how it works not what it works

---------04:58----------
them yeah so and I'm also going to go

---------05:01----------
over some of these other areas that have

---------05:02----------
this corrosion on them with flux in some

---------05:05----------
hot air because this is good at redoing

---------05:07----------
solder joints it's good at not redoing

---------05:10----------
solder joints it's good at allowing

---------05:11----------
helping solder to flow so if there's any

---------05:14----------
corroded crap this is a nice chemical

---------05:18----------
that helps get rid of it and with that I

---------05:22----------
will take a phone call

---------05:36----------
you

---------06:26----------
let's go around

---------06:28----------
out of the board

---------06:40----------
yes lots of flux it's going to go into

---------06:44----------
an ultrasonic cleaner anyway so I mean I

---------06:46----------
don't really give a about it

---------06:47----------
looking nasty right now or having excess

---------06:49----------
flux EXO there's no such thing as too

---------06:53----------
much flux the only time there's a such

---------06:56----------
thing as too much flux I should take

---------06:57----------
that back is if you're doing BGA rework

---------06:59----------
and you're working on a chip that may

---------07:02----------
float away because the flux can bubble

---------07:04----------
as it heats and if you have too much of

---------07:06----------
it it can actually mind up moving your

---------07:07----------
chip but for like this there's no

---------07:10----------
such thing as too much flux see how

---------07:13----------
stuff is flowing back in a place it's

---------07:14----------
beautiful rid of all that corrosion

---------07:22----------
and now once that's done and the joints

---------07:25----------
are flowed nicely the reason I'm doing

---------07:27----------
this first and the cleaning second is

---------07:28----------
because all the flux residue will get

---------07:30----------
cleaned off of the board by the

---------07:31----------
ultrasonic cleaner so I'm going to stop

---------07:33----------
the recording and then I'm going to show

---------07:35----------
you what it looks like when it comes out

---------07:36----------
of the cleaning process okay so we're

---------07:38----------
back now let me show you what the board

---------07:40----------
looks like under the microscope after

---------07:42----------
the ultrasonic cleaning and after

---------07:44----------
everything that we did so again this

---------07:45----------
this is not exactly a board that's you

---------07:48----------
know going to win the no-win the Miss

---------07:51----------
motherboard pageant but it is pretty

---------07:54----------
 disgusting but you can see that

---------07:56----------
it's considerably better than the

---------07:58----------
garbage we had before and when you look

---------08:01----------
under this trip you're going to notice

---------08:03----------
that there was damage done because it

---------08:05----------
was used repeatedly that would not have

---------08:07----------
been done if it wasn't turned on over

---------08:08----------
and over again you can see that that

---------08:10----------
ball at the end see that it's not really

---------08:13----------
intact it's destroyed so that chip is

---------08:16----------
going to have to be replaced and we will

---------08:17----------
go ahead and do that now that is for the

---------08:19----------
backlight so I will remove it with my JB

---------08:22----------
see I just turned my JVC on I just

---------08:24----------
turned my air filter on and oh I left my

---------08:31----------
tweezers in the front I hate when I do

---------08:34----------
that here tweezers okay I got my

---------08:41----------
tweezers back my hot air station is

---------08:43----------
ready to go and somebody walks in you

---------08:47----------
can always tell when it's a waste of

---------08:49----------
time that was just somebody who

---------08:50----------
absolutely themselves at the idea

---------08:53----------
of paying over

---------08:54----------
sixty dollars to fix the screen of an

---------08:55----------
iPad yeah sure let me spend half an hour

---------08:58----------
of time ripping glass off for for

---------09:01----------
twenty bucks

---------09:02----------
suck my dick okay so we're going to

---------09:07----------
remove this piece over here I just

---------09:08----------
turned the JBC back on this is also a

---------09:10----------
great demonstration of how quickly the

---------09:12----------
JBC gets hot because the chips already

---------09:15----------
off that's just amazing this thing is

---------09:18----------
really like above and beyond just

---------09:20----------
amazing hot air station but it's 1,800

---------09:25----------
bucks so yeah it's not 1800 dollars

---------09:29----------
worth of amazing but it is amazing I

---------09:32----------
stand by the fact that this is not 1800

---------09:35----------
dollars worth of amazing I can't just no

---------09:43----------
okay

---------09:48----------
move the old my wig got stuck for a

---------09:55----------
second okay

---------10:11----------
we put in now we're going to get a new

---------10:13----------
chip on there

---------10:37----------
I'm second okay let's get the hot air

---------10:41----------
station back on push down on the chip

---------10:43----------
make sure it's on the pads not going to

---------10:47----------
move around and now I wait

---------11:09----------
Swiper no swiping

---------11:20----------
huh yeah I hit it oh this is supposed to

---------11:30----------
be a joke now you should be able to see

---------11:34----------
when I do this that see that's what it

---------11:37----------
supposed to look like when it's nice and

---------11:39----------
fresh now what I'm gonna do we're gonna

---------11:42----------
plug this in okay joy

---------11:44----------
so my 3.42 volt rail died and the reason

---------11:49----------
it died is because this resistor over

---------11:51----------
here are 6905 that's supposed to be

---------11:53----------
measuring 10 ohms is measuring 300 kilo

---------11:57----------
ohms and that just happened out of the

---------11:58----------
blue lovely so I'm going to go ahead and

---------12:01----------
replace that so we went from no

---------12:03----------
backlight to no backlight and dead the

---------12:05----------
joys of working on corroded crap that's

---------12:08----------
all I have to say there most of what I

---------12:11----------
work on is corroded crap where you go

---------12:14----------
from no back lights you know back light

---------12:16----------
and dead or from dead to dead or from

---------12:19----------
you know here's what it is so that is

---------12:23----------
going to be this resistor on the board

---------12:25----------
that says one zero zero so to that

---------12:33----------
resistor I say goodbye see I have 16

---------12:38----------
volts over here and three volts over

---------12:40----------
there and when I measure it I have 300

---------12:42----------
kilo ohms so it's it's in some

---------12:44----------
way now let's see if I'm back where I

---------12:50----------
started

---------12:53----------
beep little soldering iron come on beep

---------12:58----------
beep beep

---------13:04----------
excellent right

---------13:09----------
we got ourselves some nice fresh flat

---------13:13----------
joints a lot of people say is too much

---------13:15----------
solder you must realize that what I'm

---------13:17----------
doing is I'm trying to get rid of the

---------13:19----------
lead-free solder while putting the let

---------13:21----------
it on so what I do is I create that big

---------13:24----------
ball and I hope everything gets sucked

---------13:26----------
up into the ball and I swoop it away if

---------13:27----------
you've ever seen a wave soldering plant

---------13:29----------
you know you'll learn a lot that you can

---------13:32----------
incorporate into your own work

---------13:33----------
on how they do things they have all

---------13:35----------
these compete see boards going over this

---------13:37----------
big vat of overflowing solder and it

---------13:40----------
goes by really fast and the whisking

---------13:43----------
away is what allows only the solder

---------13:45----------
that's necessary to stay on the pads

---------13:46----------
same thing here I may be using too much

---------13:49----------
solder but when I do that whisking

---------13:50----------
motion with my hands all the excess

---------13:53----------
solder goes away then I put the new

---------13:55----------
component on a little bit of flux and

---------13:59----------
we'll make it look nice I'm not one of

---------14:02----------
those people that goes to make the joint

---------14:03----------
absolutely perfect but I do want to make

---------14:05----------
sure that the solder is actually where

---------14:07----------
it's supposed to be so do that and do

---------14:11----------
this we have our nice little component

---------14:14----------
move it into place

---------14:18----------
there we go looks beautiful now let's

---------14:23----------
see if my fan goes back to spinning

---------14:25----------
would be great if I could be back where

---------14:27----------
I was a half-hour ago

---------14:32----------
enjoy the fan spins

---------14:34----------
unfortunately there's no light on the

---------14:36----------
screen so now I have to figure out why

---------14:38----------
there's no light on the screen so what

---------14:40----------
I'm going to do here is I'm going to put

---------14:42----------
the machine on the desk I'm going to

---------14:47----------
poke around a little now the big problem

---------14:49----------
here the big problem is that the way

---------14:52----------
this machine is is put together it's a

---------14:55----------
royal pain in the ass the test because

---------14:58----------
all the I want to measure is on the

---------15:00----------
bottom of the board and this and

---------15:03----------
the screen cable is really short so what

---------15:06----------
are you going to do anyway so first

---------15:07----------
thing I'm going to do is turn it on see

---------15:09----------
that it turns on and now I'm going to

---------15:11----------
start measuring in the backlight area so

---------15:13----------
I'm going to go back to the screen

---------15:14----------
capture over here so that you can see

---------15:16----------
what it is I'm going to measure and I'll

---------15:18----------
tell you what the voltages are that I

---------15:19----------
get as I go so the first end

---------15:23----------
looking for here in the back light area

---------15:26----------
so I've already confirmed that I have

---------15:28----------
eight point five volts at back light now

---------15:30----------
that doesn't mean that it's working and

---------15:33----------
it doesn't mean that it's broken it the

---------15:35----------
voltage is going through the circuit so

---------15:37----------
I know that there's no break in the line

---------15:39----------
from here to here there's no break in

---------15:40----------
the line from here to there from there

---------15:42----------
there I know that there's no break in

---------15:44----------
the line across this this top section so

---------15:47----------
the whole idea the way this works you

---------15:48----------
should you should check out my video on

---------15:50----------
how to DC to DC boost circuit works

---------15:51----------
where I explain all of this so I know

---------15:53----------
that there's no breaks on the top now

---------15:55----------
what I want to do this is the LED driver

---------15:57----------
chip that's going to be responsible for

---------15:58----------
the DC to DC boost circuit doing its

---------16:00----------
boosting I want to check back light and

---------16:02----------
Nabal voltage so let's just check where

---------16:05----------
that exactly I would measure that on my

---------16:07----------
board view software this board view

---------16:10----------
software is such a pile of okay

---------16:14----------
such a steaming pile so first thing I'm

---------16:17----------
going to do is measure voltage in this

---------16:19----------
area and the voltage that I get here is

---------16:24----------
let's see can I get that without a

---------16:27----------
microscope barely okay let's go back to

---------16:36----------
the microscope so I can see this stuff

---------16:38----------
well

---------17:00----------
it's a little blurry but I'd have to

---------17:01----------
move the stands in order to go any

---------17:03----------
further up so I'll just live with it

---------17:07----------
zero now at the top of this voltage

---------17:10----------
divider I have eight point three so it's

---------17:14----------
supposed to be dividing this is the

---------17:16----------
interesting thing so what's going on is

---------17:18----------
my hmm

---------17:21----------
all right so I'm going to turn this off

---------17:22----------
right now now this is interesting

---------17:25----------
so this resistor measured fine before

---------17:27----------
right so according to this that first

---------17:30----------
resistor is supposed to be 200 kilohms

---------17:32----------
and when I measure here I get 200 kilo

---------17:37----------
ohms okay I was getting 200 kilo ohms

---------17:42----------
and now I get piece of

---------17:47----------
crap okay

---------17:49----------
that thing worked before not like any of

---------17:53----------
you are going to believe me anyway so

---------17:54----------
I'll just replace it not like any of you

---------17:59----------
are going to believe me and never reason

---------18:02----------
a lie trust me I know the only thing I

---------18:07----------
get out of lyin is looking like a [ __ ]

---------18:08----------
on camera which I do enough as is so now

---------18:14----------
we're going to find another one if any

---------18:18----------
of my donor boards have another one

---------18:20----------
which who are we kidding seriously

---------18:31----------
seriously

---------18:32----------
okay it's 200 kilohms in the area 200

---------18:36----------
kilo ohms I'll steal another 200 kilo

---------18:39----------
ohm resister let's see where on this

---------18:40----------
board can I find another 200 kilo ohm

---------18:42----------
resistor with the same specs your

---------18:47----------
it I'll take you okay are three eight

---------18:49----------
nine one I should weigh no that's the

---------18:52----------
different board that I don't have crap

---------18:53----------
I'm looking for it on the 34:37 I have

---------18:56----------
to open another schematic here and

---------18:58----------
another board view this is what I hate

---------19:00----------
doing because you're right you know I

---------19:02----------
know what you're thinking why don't you

---------19:03----------
just find another one surely there's

---------19:04----------
another 200 kilo ohm resistor on the

---------19:06----------
board but now I got open to schematics

---------19:09----------
now I got open to board views side by

---------19:11----------
side and that

---------19:12----------
just a pain in the ass all right so fine

---------19:15----------
200 kilo ohms I need 200 kilo ohms 0 2 0

---------19:21----------
1 this is good okay so are ya are 1796

---------19:25----------
let's find that on an 8 to 0 34 37 and

---------19:28----------
steal it for the voltage divider for

---------19:29----------
backlight enable I hope that somebody

---------19:33----------
doesn't walk in while I'm doing this

---------19:34----------
because I'll forget what I was doing and

---------19:37----------
why I was here and I have to start from

---------19:40----------
scratch that's what sucks about working

---------19:43----------
on the weekend being the only person

---------19:44----------
here like every time somebody walks in

---------19:45----------
if I'm doing a border pair I freak I

---------19:48----------
have to remember what it was I was doing

---------19:50----------
and if I can't remember what I was doing

---------19:52----------
I have to start from scratch and that is

---------19:53----------
just annoying as hell alright so I found

---------19:55----------
it now let's get to replacing and you

---------20:00----------
can kind of see that it looks up

---------20:01----------
here is one of those cases where if it

---------20:03----------
looks up it is up and it

---------20:08----------
would look bad that's the thing but it

---------20:09----------
looked nasty but it measured totally

---------20:11----------
fine so I figured you know I figured I

---------20:14----------
had a little bit of some leeway

---------20:16----------
apparently not okay let's get rid of

---------20:19----------
this go away

---------20:26----------
trolling little piece of cue

---------20:41----------
see I take time to orient the tip so

---------20:43----------
that as much of it as touching the board

---------20:45----------
as possible a lot of new people will you

---------20:49----------
know why does it my solder stick and

---------20:52----------
they're doing some dumb like this

---------20:53----------
with like putting solder on the iron you

---------20:55----------
see how it climbs all the way up the

---------20:56----------
iron and then they touch the board or

---------20:57----------
like my son is not sticking my side is

---------21:00----------
not sticking it's like of course it's

---------21:02----------
not see you you have to you have to heat

---------21:05----------
the pad and then you rush the solder

---------21:07----------
into the pad and there you go the solder

---------21:09----------
follows he'd and I know you're going to

---------21:19----------
say well Lou everybody doesn't know how

---------21:21----------
to do this everybody has to start

---------21:24----------
somewhere you're right that's why I put

---------21:26----------
up all the stuff I would like to think

---------21:28----------
that I'm not doing it as a waste of my

---------21:30----------
time

---------21:31----------
please watch it read it learn okay let's

---------21:43----------
see if I get a light on the screen now

---------21:45----------
that would be great if I get a light on

---------21:47----------
the screen now

---------21:57----------
aha hey I turned off the light for the

---------22:00----------
video stuff so I look like but I

---------22:04----------
always look like so who cares

---------22:06----------
delete this part covering the name and

---------22:10----------
there you go I have a light so that's

---------22:14----------
that so yeah this was supposed to be a

---------22:16----------
much shorter video than it wound up

---------22:18----------
being but yeah drying out your machine

---------22:22----------
does not work if it does work your

---------22:27----------
Europe you maybe when this is going to

---------22:29----------
look ridiculous if it does work it

---------22:31----------
either means you were one of those lucky

---------22:33----------
people where it never the liquid never

---------22:35----------
actually got to the motherboard or it

---------22:37----------
means that you're one of the lucky

---------22:38----------
people who has a corroding motherboard

---------22:40----------
but for some reason it works anyway but

---------22:42----------
that doesn't mean that that's good

---------22:43----------
advice it doesn't mean that letting the

---------22:45----------
machine dry out with that inside of

---------22:47----------
it is good advice because you see what

---------22:49----------
it does this was all on camera from the

---------22:50----------
beginning to the end you see what it

---------22:51----------
does again it's just like the rice

---------22:53----------
theory the rice crap is all a bunch of

---------22:56----------
 that's a myth so I was just

---------22:57----------
letting the thing dry out that's a

---------22:59----------
really really really bad idea

---------23:01----------
even if you don't have the best of

---------23:03----------
equipment just you know get by a baking

---------23:05----------
tray from the corner store deli for a

---------23:07----------
dollar get a toothbrush get some 91%

---------23:10----------
alcohol from your local pharmacy pour it

---------23:12----------
in and get buy a new toothbrush this

---------23:14----------
entire project is going to cost you like

---------23:15----------
five or ten bucks buy 85 or 86 or a

---------23:18----------
double-0 Phillips screwdriver or

---------23:20----------
whatever you need for your particular

---------23:21----------
machine to take it apart and take it

---------23:23----------
apart and put the board in there and

---------23:24----------
give it a good scrub you're not going to

---------23:26----------
be able to get underneath every chip

---------23:28----------
you're not going to do a perfect job but

---------23:29----------
it's much better than just letting that

---------23:31----------
 sit there with the battery plugged

---------23:32----------
in and all this corroding crap getting

---------23:34----------
on it and that's that for today
