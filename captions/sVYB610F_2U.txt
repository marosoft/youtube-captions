---------00:00----------
watermelon is the best flavor of Jolly

---------00:01----------
Rancher by far anybody who says cherry

---------00:04----------
is just out of their mind alright today

---------00:07----------
we have another macbook let's try and

---------00:11----------
fix this macbook the claimed problem is

---------00:12----------
no power so this thing is stuck at 5

---------00:15----------
volts when you plug in the USB c charger

---------00:17----------
what power well must be missing their PP

---------00:20----------
3 B 3 underscore g3 hot it's going to be

---------00:22----------
cry out for the charger to be able to

---------00:24----------
communicate with the system circuit that

---------00:26----------
creates PP 3 B 3 underscore g3 hodda's

---------00:28----------
around used $69.99 the board it looks

---------00:32----------
like this like this oh god gross yeah

---------00:43----------
this is a board for Paul if you look at

---------00:45----------
the rest of this board there there and

---------00:48----------
here we get up to the CPU v core circuit

---------00:50----------
I don't know if that's corrosion or

---------00:52----------
little lines it looks like when the C

---------00:55----------
pic shoots out its internal respiratory

---------00:57----------
organs from its orifice like this is

---------01:00----------
what that looks like this up here means

---------01:02----------
that most likely my CPU is gonna be dead

---------01:05----------
after I fix all the stuff that's causing

---------01:07----------
it to not charge I think we're just

---------01:11----------
going to start over on this section of

---------01:13----------
the board so how will you be celebrating

---------01:15----------
the holidays Rossman group I will be

---------01:17----------
celebrating the holidays by sitting here

---------01:19----------
and fixing some mac books

---------01:24----------
I'm not gonna have my home machine in

---------01:27----------
time for that so I'm gonna be here as

---------01:28----------
flexing MacBooks my apartment still

---------01:30----------
looks like because I haven't had

---------01:31----------
time to hang my panels but figure out

---------01:33----------
how to buy a drill to hang my panels or

---------01:35----------
throw away all my furniture I have two

---------01:37----------
old couches that I need to take down

---------01:39----------
four flights of stairs

---------01:41----------
what's TaskRabbit no seriously that

---------01:48----------
works

---------01:52----------
I'm a new task rabbit exist I will

---------01:57----------
likely spend yeah I will fix MacBooks

---------02:01----------
for Christmas

---------02:17----------
find a girl or a prostitute better than

---------02:19----------
being on your own I'm not hiring a

---------02:21----------
prostitute for Christmas then they won't

---------02:24----------
be able to visit their family every

---------02:27----------
prostitute deserves Christmas Day Off at

---------02:29----------
this point why wouldn't the owners buy a

---------02:30----------
new MacBook because unlike you the

---------02:33----------
owners ain't ballin like that they could

---------02:38----------
spend 1/4 the money to have me make it

---------02:39----------
work again then they'll do that not

---------02:43----------
everybody's got your kind of money

---------02:45----------
one can't ever get bored in New York you

---------02:47----------
want to find time visit the village of

---------02:48----------
hang out about asked if you're not

---------02:50----------
looking to get wasted at some it the

---------02:52----------
options to have fun get old very quickly

---------02:55----------
they ever it's the same

---------02:58----------
overpriced restaurant bar overpriced

---------03:01----------
restaurant bar bodega overpriced

---------03:03----------
restaurant bar bodega overpriced

---------03:06----------
restaurant oh look another bar look a

---------03:09----------
bodega it's the same copied and

---------03:13----------
pasted it of millions of times it's

---------03:17----------
quite easy to get bored oh yeah

---------03:31----------
a little bit more flux remember

---------03:34----------
bigger the glob the better the job

---------04:15----------
I destroy that inductor oh god yeah that

---------04:19----------
inductor got on - oh is very - means of

---------04:22----------
that duck don't you go near my donor

---------04:42----------
would you take your crit ease on

---------04:44----------
Christmas to your shop maybe to keep me

---------04:48----------
company on Christmas I'm gonna be the

---------04:50----------
only one here usually on holidays I'm

---------04:52----------
the only one here to work I'm not enough

---------04:56----------
of an to ask people to work on

---------04:58----------
holidays but I have enough of an

---------05:01----------
to work myself on holiday I mean enough

---------05:04----------
of an to myself to work on the

---------05:06----------
holiday all right so the pp 3v3

---------05:10----------
underscore g3 hot circuit area has been

---------05:12----------
restored now we're gonna look around

---------05:15----------
this area seems to be a little bit of

---------05:17----------
dirt a little bit of junk there's junk

---------05:23----------
here here here here here

---------05:52----------
that resistor is junk that cap looks

---------05:55----------
nasty that looks nasty that's gross

---------06:00----------
gross why is you know have a sub button

---------06:02----------
I don't have a sub button because I'm

---------06:04----------
not affiliated and I'm not a twitch

---------06:06----------
affiliate or partner I'm not a twitch

---------06:08----------
affiliate or partner because they act

---------06:09----------
like a jealous girlfriend that doesn't

---------06:11----------
want you to talk to your friends I can't

---------06:14----------
do a stream to twitch and YouTube but

---------06:16----------
from a partner on twitch therefore I'm

---------06:20----------
not a partner

---------06:53----------
I just picked up the resistor and it's

---------06:59----------
gonna get solder

---------08:08----------
you

---------08:23----------
great let's see if we have PP 3v3

---------08:26----------
underscore g3 HOD before anything else

---------08:30----------
and we don't uh uh there's a bridge over

---------08:37----------
here

---------08:38----------
whoopsie wait now that our my net bridge

---------08:42----------
is fine even though this stuff is

---------08:43----------
bridged all the stuff that's bridged is

---------08:45----------
actually attached to one another so

---------08:46----------
there's no issue with that

---------09:09----------
you

---------09:45----------
one thing maybe I was good

---------09:51----------
you see make sure that only make sure of

---------09:54----------
those times

---------09:57----------
now somebody's got to test that for me I

---------10:01----------
don't need licorice what is it

---------10:12----------
bonbon I can't read the ingredients

---------10:19----------
ammonium chloride liquorice powder

---------10:21----------
licorice extract this is licorice you're

---------10:24----------
trying to trick me you try it first Paul

---------10:31----------
you have to try one of these now I hate

---------10:34----------
licorice let's see six Minuten what's

---------10:58----------
the S stand for Paul is candy

---------11:20----------
and

---------11:29----------
profile

---------11:38----------
this isn't that bad this is not the

---------11:43----------
shitty licorice that you buy in the

---------11:44----------
store

---------12:04----------
hmm pretty good speaking of pretty good

---------12:08----------
nineteen point nine volts 350 milliamps

---------12:11----------
this is turning on this is turning on

---------12:15----------
now let's see if you're getting CPU v

---------12:16----------
core I wonder if eating this stuff is

---------12:24----------
what allows Duke to solve all of his

---------12:26----------
mystery boards

---------12:29----------
it gives Duke his magical powers to be

---------12:32----------
able to do board repair without a

---------12:33----------
microscope on zero to zero ones and do

---------12:38----------
you believe him when he says that he

---------12:39----------
uses a paint stripper to do all of his

---------12:41----------
hot air rework oh my god the core of

---------12:47----------
this one is the core mmm whoa

---------12:51----------
Oh God did you get to the core of yours

---------12:56----------
yet mmm mmm are you serious another dead

---------13:04----------
CPU no way I'm hell not another

---------13:12----------
dead CPU whoo ha whoa that was intense

---------13:17----------
did you get

---------13:21----------
Oh not dead CPU question mark next board

---------13:31----------
alright so let's go over some of the

---------13:33----------
issues that we had with this board

---------13:35----------
the first issue with this board is that

---------13:38----------
we were getting 5 volts in the charger

---------13:40----------
rather than 20 volts now on this USBC

---------13:44----------
amp meter I want to see 20 volts not 5

---------13:47----------
volts so on the old MacBooks we used to

---------13:50----------
call it having a green light or not

---------13:51----------
having a green light if you had a green

---------13:53----------
light and meant the charger was able to

---------13:55----------
communicate with the computer if you did

---------13:56----------
not have a green light the charger could

---------13:58----------
not communicate with the computer here

---------14:00----------
we don't have MagSafe anymore because

---------14:01----------
Apple removes one of the very few good

---------14:04----------
ideas they ever had we just have a

---------14:05----------
magnetic charger so that if you trip

---------14:07----------
over the charger it doesn't destroy your

---------14:09----------
a charger and your computer but Tim Cook

---------14:12----------
has decided to remove some of the very

---------14:14----------
few features that made the MacBook a

---------14:16----------
decent machine so now we don't have a

---------14:18----------
light in the charger anymore so how do

---------14:20----------
you tell if there's communication

---------14:21----------
between the charger and the MacBook the

---------14:23----------
way you tell is whether or not you have

---------14:25----------
5 volts or 20 volts when you use a USBC

---------14:28----------
a meter which Allah link to below to

---------14:31----------
check because the USBC charger remember

---------14:33----------
this can charge your phone at 5 volts or

---------14:35----------
it can run a laptop at 20 volts now in

---------14:38----------
order for that communication to occur if

---------14:40----------
we look over here you have the charge

---------14:42----------
port so you have a bi-directional data

---------14:44----------
line here and this bi-directional data

---------14:46----------
line is gonna be between the charger and

---------14:48----------
the CD 3215 ship which is a Texas

---------14:51----------
Instruments chip that's you 3200 now

---------14:54----------
remember on the older Mac books you

---------14:57----------
needed the charger to talk to a chip

---------14:59----------
called the SMC the system management

---------15:01----------
controller in order for you to get a

---------15:02----------
green light here it's similar but not

---------15:05----------
quite the same you the charger has to

---------15:06----------
talk to the CD 3215 ship which is the

---------15:08----------
USB C MUX in order for you to get 20

---------15:10----------
volts and we weren't getting 20 volts in

---------15:12----------
our charger now if you look at the

---------15:15----------
schematic and board view again this chip

---------15:17----------
is going to be powered by one of the

---------15:19----------
power rails that it needs is pp 3v3

---------15:22----------
underscore g3 hot and pp 3 v3 underscore

---------15:27----------
g3 hot was missing on this board so we

---------15:30----------
decided to go over to the circuit that

---------15:32----------
creates bp3 v3 underscore g3 hot if

---------15:34----------
you're not get

---------15:35----------
20 volts in the charger just like on the

---------15:37----------
old machines how you needed to check PP

---------15:39----------
3 before to underscore G 3 hot before

---------15:41----------
anything else if you didn't have a green

---------15:42----------
or orange light on these you need to

---------15:43----------
check PP 3 V 3 underscore G 3 hot if you

---------15:46----------
don't get the green light of 20 volts on

---------15:49----------
your USB C charger so we checked around

---------15:52----------
this area and everything was all burned

---------15:55----------
up in nasty we replaced it after that we

---------15:58----------
would have had not had cpu V core a very

---------16:00----------
common area that corrodes because it's

---------16:01----------
right along the edge is the input to CPU

---------16:05----------
V chord now use 7100 this here this is a

---------16:09----------
chip that's going to set the CPUs

---------16:12----------
voltage and C V reg voltage regulator

---------16:15----------
CPU and on the top here as I went over

---------16:19----------
in my in my basic electronics playlist

---------16:22----------
typically the voltage going into a chip

---------16:23----------
to actually turn it on so it can work is

---------16:25----------
going to be up here and the resistor

---------16:31----------
that was blown was r7 101 which is going

---------16:34----------
to be voltage in from P P bus underscore

---------16:36----------
g3 aughts power that and that pad was

---------16:38----------
missing so we ran a little jumper wire

---------16:41----------
there this is gonna go into the Museum

---------16:43----------
of Modern Art if anything look at that

---------16:44----------
jumper wire beautiful beautiful I think

---------16:49----------
it's going right to that resistor over

---------16:50----------
there and if we look we can use Paul

---------16:58----------
Daniels as software Paul Daniels of

---------17:01----------
software will show us where that is so

---------17:03----------
that pad for pin 1 of that resistor was

---------17:05----------
missing but Paul Daniels of software

---------17:07----------
will show me that the closest point I

---------17:09----------
could grab it from are these caps over

---------17:10----------
here which is how he knew where to run

---------17:12----------
the jumper wire which is how this board

---------17:14----------
worked so with that I'm gonna be ending

---------17:16----------
my stream the next time that you see me

---------17:18----------
streaming it's probably gonna be with a

---------17:19----------
nice new overhead camera and regular

---------17:22----------
camera lens can't wait to get that stuff

---------17:24----------
try it out let's try to go up the

---------17:25----------
quality of video here a little bit be a

---------17:27----------
little bit more professional and I am

---------17:30----------
going to put back together the these two

---------17:32----------
machines and that'll be it and as always

---------17:37----------
I hope you all learn something
