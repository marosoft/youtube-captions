---------00:00----------
all right so what you have over here is

---------00:01----------
somebody who said that it was just the

---------00:02----------
backlight fuse that they needed and one

---------00:05----------
of the things that I'm always telling

---------00:07----------
you guys is that you really shouldn't be

---------00:09----------
doing what people ask you to do you

---------00:10----------
should be figuring out what they want

---------00:12----------
and then you come up with what it is you

---------00:14----------
have to do so this has a board that has

---------00:16----------
a beautiful back life use with no

---------00:17----------
problems but it has a chip the LP 8550

---------00:21----------
that is totally as you can see

---------00:25----------
under it looks pretty nasty and the

---------00:27----------
corroded destroyed worthless here

---------00:32----------
and just running a bunch of little

---------00:37----------
jumpers for the switch and the feedback

---------00:38----------
trace over here so that I can actually I

---------00:41----------
can actually have this board work again

---------00:44----------
and you know one of the things that I

---------00:45----------
have always said about when people ask

---------00:48----------
you to do specific things and why it is

---------00:49----------
I don't do that yeah one of the things

---------00:51----------
you have to think about is that a lot of

---------00:54----------
times people don't really want to take

---------00:56----------
responsibility for their own mistakes

---------00:58----------
especially when when it being your

---------01:02----------
mistake versus their mistake will mean a

---------01:04----------
difference in what they have to pay so

---------01:06----------
what do I mean by that so this one

---------01:07----------
person was begging me to replace their

---------01:09----------
backlight for use and like you know the

---------01:12----------
you know that motherboard repair right

---------01:14----------
that's not for me

---------01:15----------
right like they got this idea that it's

---------01:17----------
it's not like the rate that they are

---------01:19----------
gonna be paying I'm not the

---------01:21----------
that's gonna charge them that much yeah

---------01:23----------
that's for the rest of the world right

---------01:25----------
and it's like no that's for everybody

---------01:27----------
really and the thing is you know let's

---------01:31----------
say I actually replaced that fuse for 50

---------01:33----------
bucks knowing in my heart of hearts that

---------01:35----------
it's not the problem before I even took

---------01:37----------
the back cover off of the computer and

---------01:40----------
let's say that I replaced that piece for

---------01:42----------
you and it doesn't work there's a lot of

---------01:45----------
room for a lot of paranoid thoughts to

---------01:47----------
start running through this this person's

---------01:48----------
head you know they could start thinking

---------01:50----------
things like okay he must have screwed it

---------01:54----------
up my estimate is not wrong so now

---------01:55----------
you're dealing with ego which is a pain

---------01:57----------
in the ass you know I know I'm right you

---------01:59----------
got that whole male you know ship then

---------02:01----------
you can also be dealing with something

---------02:03----------
even worse which is paranoia which is he

---------02:05----------
knew he hurt but he's not stupid but he

---------02:07----------
purposely did the job wrong so that he

---------02:09----------
could upsell me on something else now

---------02:11----------
you're dealing with trust issues and all

---------02:12----------
sorts of other

---------02:13----------
nonsense that really wastes time and

---------02:16----------
ruins your ability to deal with other

---------02:17----------
customers it takes away from the time

---------02:19----------
that you can spend doing other repairs

---------02:21----------
or doing anything else that you need to

---------02:23----------
do with your business now the problem

---------02:26----------
again is uh it's gonna be that you're

---------02:31----------
gonna be asking for money at the end of

---------02:32----------
that for something that doesn't work so

---------02:33----------
let's say they say replace my back light

---------02:35----------
fuse replace this little component and

---------02:37----------
they point to him what they're gonna do

---------02:39----------
is they're going to point to the little

---------02:40----------
thing and they're gonna want you to

---------02:41----------
replace that thing for and and when it

---------02:45----------
doesn't work are they actually going to

---------02:47----------
pay you that that's that's a big part of

---------02:49----------
this problem and you know they say they

---------02:51----------
will they say oh yeah I'll pay you and I

---------02:53----------
replace it but they're not saying that

---------02:54----------
because I actually want to pay you for a

---------02:56----------
place in the component they're saying it

---------02:57----------
out of an honest wishful thinking that

---------02:59----------
that's it and when that's not it you're

---------03:01----------
gonna deal with again you're gonna deal

---------03:02----------
with that argument you're gonna deal

---------03:03----------
with that person telling you well are

---------03:05----------
you sure you did it right are you sure

---------03:07----------
you use the right fuse let me see the

---------03:08----------
fuse that used let me see you soldered

---------03:10----------
Oh see how it started on lopsided that's

---------03:12----------
probably why it doesn't work again

---------03:13----------
you're gonna go down that entire thing

---------03:15----------
because you don't you don't understand

---------03:16----------
how people think you don't get that when

---------03:19----------
when you do something that doesn't work

---------03:21----------
and you ask people for money they're

---------03:22----------
gonna have a natural instinct inside of

---------03:24----------
them to preserve their money which is

---------03:26----------
and they're gonna you know live out that

---------03:29----------
instinct by arguing with you and again

---------03:33----------
though if in the solutions model or I'm

---------03:34----------
simply charging you a rate if it works I

---------03:36----------
could be giving you about a board back

---------03:37----------
with 50 wires on it and with everything

---------03:40----------
started on lopsided and nobody's gonna

---------03:42----------
care because in that situation I'm

---------03:44----------
charging you for something that works

---------03:46----------
there's no reason for somebody to

---------03:47----------
dispute something that works whereas

---------03:49----------
again if I'm saying I'm gonna take $50

---------03:51----------
of your money but I'm giving you back

---------03:52----------
something that's dead there's a lot of

---------03:54----------
reason for them to dispute your work

---------03:55----------
there's a lot of reason for them to

---------03:56----------
dispute the validity of what you've done

---------03:58----------
there's a lot of reason for them to

---------03:59----------
accuse you of up because it's

---------04:02----------
just a natural instinct it's an instinct

---------04:04----------
to protect my money and that that model

---------04:07----------
is a model that I think is really really

---------04:09----------
bad and because even though I want

---------04:12----------
people to take responsibility for what

---------04:13----------
they've done even if I want people to

---------04:15----------
take responsibility for wasting my time

---------04:17----------
at the end of the day what I realized in

---------04:20----------
that model is that I don't have it in me

---------04:21----------
to take somebody's money when I haven't

---------04:23----------
actually made their product better if I

---------04:25----------
haven't actually fixed something

---------04:27----------
I haven't given you a new system that

---------04:29----------
does something that helps you I can't

---------04:31----------
take your money I just I can't something

---------04:33----------
even though I know that you wasted an

---------04:34----------
hour of my time I know that the hour of

---------04:37----------
my time was wasted because you thought

---------04:39----------
you knew better than me even though I

---------04:40----------
feel like you deserve to have to spend

---------04:43----------
it I can't bring you up in the POS

---------04:45----------
system I don't have it in me to type in

---------04:46----------
even if it was ten bucks I don't have

---------04:48----------
any me to type $10 at enter and swipe

---------04:50----------
your card if I didn't if the result of

---------04:53----------
my work did not build something or make

---------04:54----------
something better and I used to wonder

---------04:56----------
why it was I was apprehensive to do

---------04:58----------
these things and I wasn't until recently

---------04:59----------
that I was really able to put it into

---------05:01----------
words over the past two or three years

---------05:02----------
but yeah I don't I don't like dealing

---------05:05----------
with the back and forth when somebody's

---------05:06----------
proposed solution doesn't work and I

---------05:09----------
really don't like taking money for

---------05:12----------
things that don't work and I don't like

---------05:14----------
wasting my time I don't like conflict

---------05:16----------
and that's what a lot of this comes down

---------05:19----------
to

---------05:26----------
all right let's see what we got here

---------05:27----------
let's see it

---------05:28----------
short to ground before I do anything

---------05:29----------
else that caused all this nightmare to

---------05:32----------
begin with

---------05:35----------
as you know gesso recently switched over

---------05:38----------
to this model and that's and I think

---------05:40----------
it's pretty cool so what she used to do

---------05:41----------
is she used to do you know follow all

---------05:44----------
sorts of phone liquid damage repairs and

---------05:46----------
she had these specific rate for specific

---------05:48----------
things with a and with a really low cost

---------05:51----------
estimate fee and the problem with that

---------05:54----------
by the way again I never replaced the

---------05:57----------
fuse the fuse was never touched on this

---------05:59----------
computer and yeah anyway so the problem

---------06:03----------
with that system is that Apple is going

---------06:06----------
to replace your phone with the iPhone 5

---------06:08----------
I think for something like around 200

---------06:09----------
bucks here's the thing I don't mean to

---------06:11----------
insult Jess's business in any way let me

---------06:13----------
just say that I'm from not insulting her

---------06:14----------
business but if Apple's gonna replace

---------06:17----------
your phone for 200 bucks 90% of the time

---------06:20----------
the solution that jess is going to

---------06:21----------
propose that she can offer you for

---------06:23----------
liquid damage repair on an iPhone 5 is

---------06:25----------
going to suck you need a new screen you

---------06:27----------
need a new power flex you need a new

---------06:29----------
battery you need one hour of my time

---------06:31----------
onboard repair you need these two chips

---------06:34----------
that cost 20 bucks you add all that up

---------06:37----------
with the labor and everything and you're

---------06:39----------
getting back a phone that's pretty much

---------06:41----------
been liquid damage before so it's been

---------06:43----------
liquid damage before you're getting back

---------06:45----------
that phone that's been liquid damage

---------06:46----------
before and God knows what time because

---------06:48----------
again well I say 2 to 4 days for border

---------06:50----------
pay and sometimes quicker that's for

---------06:52----------
boards that are not a nightmare the

---------06:54----------
boards that are a nightmare you're

---------06:56----------
waiting the longer a little much longer

---------06:58----------
than that and I know that her model is

---------07:00----------
very similar for things that are not a

---------07:02----------
nightmare

---------07:02----------
it's done like that for things that are

---------07:04----------
a nightmare bottom of the pile and

---------07:06----------
whereas again an apple for 200 bucks you

---------07:08----------
give them that foam and they can give

---------07:10----------
you back something that works perfectly

---------07:12----------
very quickly so what she changed it was

---------07:15----------
instead of this whole model where again

---------07:16----------
I'm putting all this time into it all

---------07:18----------
this parts all this money and they're

---------07:20----------
saying no send it back to me because

---------07:21----------
Apple will do it for 200 she decided let

---------07:23----------
me offer something that well you know

---------07:25----------
what the price is up from there's

---------07:26----------
there's no bickering but no back and

---------07:28----------
forth arguing you know nothing like that

---------07:29----------
and I'm gonna offer you a specific thing

---------07:31----------
I'm gonna offer you a specific solution

---------07:33----------
for that price and that's a solution

---------07:34----------
that somebody else won't offer you which

---------07:35----------
is I will get you data if I can get your

---------07:39----------
dad it's 200 if I cannot get your data

---------07:41----------
it is $0

---------07:42----------
you want to do it again it just

---------07:44----------
eliminates all the arguing eliminates

---------07:46----------
all the eliminates all the I

---------07:48----------
want you to replace my battery and it's

---------07:49----------
like no you don't because when I replace

---------07:51----------
your battery and your phone don't work

---------07:52----------
you're not gonna want to pay me for it

---------07:54----------
again just it and I think that's a great

---------07:56----------
model and it works it really and it

---------07:59----------
works for me

---------07:59----------
so if you've asked me can you replace

---------08:02----------
the specific component on my board what

---------08:04----------
would it cost and I say no or I've

---------08:06----------
ignored your email or I have not replied

---------08:08----------
to you I just want you to know it's not

---------08:10----------
because I'm being mean it's because my

---------08:11----------
business does not operate on the model

---------08:13----------
of replacing specific things for set

---------08:15----------
rates I believe in the solutions based

---------08:17----------
model and the solutions based model here

---------08:19----------
I'm looking to do is I'm not looking to

---------08:21----------
do what you're telling me to do I'm

---------08:22----------
looking to figure out the root of your

---------08:23----------
problem and then create a flat rate to

---------08:26----------
solve that problem that I feel will make

---------08:29----------
every bit of my time worth it again the

---------08:32----------
time I spend on the phone with you the

---------08:34----------
time I spend warranty repairing it if it

---------08:36----------
comes back the tie the the potential

---------08:38----------
ramifications of if something breaks you

---------08:41----------
know again I've seen these these Yelp

---------08:43----------
reviews where people say well you know

---------08:45----------
if you're a professional you should not

---------08:47----------
you should not be breaking it so you

---------08:49----------
shouldn't be charging for that well

---------08:50----------
you're right I shouldn't be breaking it

---------08:52----------
I shouldn't be charging you for me

---------08:53----------
potentially breaking him but I am a

---------08:55----------
professional which is why I'm charging a

---------08:56----------
professional rate which is you know Yee

---------08:59----------
a one way or the other you're paying for

---------09:01----------
service and I understand when my model

---------09:04----------
doesn't work I understand that there are

---------09:06----------
also times that I'd know damn well that

---------09:08----------
there's a 99% chance that you replaced

---------09:09----------
that one little thing and it works again

---------09:11----------
and if you believe that to be true I'll

---------09:13----------
have not gonna have any scorn did

---------09:15----------
there's no they don't get a twister

---------09:17----------
there's no hate there's no disdain here

---------09:19----------
I'll happily refer you to somebody who

---------09:20----------
has a different business model for me to

---------09:22----------
do that work for you but it's not gonna

---------09:24----------
be me again like if you say I want you

---------09:27----------
to replace this plug on this camera

---------09:29----------
system my first question for you is

---------09:31----------
gonna be what is wrong and when you tell

---------09:35----------
me well I'm not getting signal to this

---------09:36----------
camera and I see that using an HD SDI

---------09:39----------
system and that you're running that HD

---------09:41----------
SDI yr 1900 feet like I know that that's

---------09:46----------
not gonna work so what I'm gonna do is

---------09:48----------
instead I'm gonna propose a solution to

---------09:49----------
your problem so your problem is this

---------09:52----------
camera is not working getting signal you

---------09:55----------
want me to do this

---------09:56----------
no no no again I I tell everybody who

---------09:58----------
works to the same thing do figure out

---------10:00----------
what it is the person wants to

---------10:02----------
accomplish figure out what is their pain

---------10:03----------
point what is their problem and then we

---------10:05----------
come up with the solution based on that

---------10:07----------
do not do what people ask and it's not

---------10:09----------
about hating customers it's not about

---------10:10----------
disdain I love helping people I love

---------10:13----------
I love making systems better I love

---------10:16----------
doing a lot of the things that I do but

---------10:19----------
I want to be a part of success I don't

---------10:21----------
want to be a part of conflict and

---------10:22----------
failure which is why I use the solutions

---------10:24----------
model again this right here can you

---------10:27----------
replace my back light fuse

---------10:28----------
this is the original back light fuse

---------10:30----------
look at this original back light fuse

---------10:32----------
original back light fuse perfectly fine

---------10:34----------
the problem was that your chip was

---------10:36----------
missing half of its balls and that and

---------10:39----------
that the little traces on the board were

---------10:41----------
barely being held together so even when

---------10:43----------
you put a new LED driver on it's

---------10:44----------
flickering and that that's what fixed it

---------10:45----------
so if I had actually done what this

---------10:48----------
person asked me to do argument and I

---------10:51----------
wouldn't have had the time to make this

---------10:52----------
video I would spend more time arguing

---------10:54----------
with this person then I would have

---------10:55----------
actually spent on the video and people

---------10:57----------
say that again they get this idea that I

---------10:58----------
have these policies because I hate

---------10:59----------
mankind and I hate all people it's not

---------11:02----------
that I hate people it's not that I is

---------11:05----------
that I like my time I like people

---------11:07----------
I want this guy to have a working

---------11:08----------
machine without having to spend time

---------11:09----------
arguing and feeling like he got ripped

---------11:11----------
off and getting in and going back and

---------11:12----------
forth which is why I have a solutions

---------11:15----------
mob I don't mind people I just don't

---------11:18----------
like dealing with unnecessary conflict

---------11:21----------
in business when there's really no

---------11:23----------
reason for it and setting myself up for

---------11:24----------
that unnecessary conflict and setting

---------11:26----------
myself up to disappoint other people

---------11:28----------
that's kind of what you're doing when

---------11:29----------
you wait when you are not taking

---------11:31----------
responsibility for telling somebody hey

---------11:33----------
you're wrong or you're probably wrong

---------11:36----------
this is what you actually need and a lot

---------11:38----------
of people just don't know how to do that
