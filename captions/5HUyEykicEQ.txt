---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna get

---------00:01----------
started on an eight to zero thirty four

---------00:04----------
seventy six board that is not turning on

---------00:06----------
and not giving us a green light in the

---------00:07----------
charger I'm gonna try to walk through

---------00:08----------
what it is that's wrong with it and

---------00:10----------
hopefully we can solve it so let's bring

---------00:13----------
up this schematic in the board view over

---------00:15----------
here so that we can check out why it is

---------00:17----------
that may be occurring and so how does

---------00:26----------
the charger talk to the SMC how would we

---------00:29----------
get a green light that circuit works up

---------00:33----------
here so charger adapter sent this is

---------00:39----------
with a charge port this is the adapter

---------00:41----------
sense line and this is the chip that

---------00:45----------
allows the charger adapter sense line to

---------00:47----------
talk to the system management controller

---------00:49----------
you can see this one wire would go is a

---------00:56----------
bi-directional data line that's gonna go

---------00:58----------
to you five thousand which is the SMC so

---------01:04----------
let's go back up here now in order for

---------01:07----------
this to work this chip needs to be

---------01:09----------
powered by this chip and this trip over

---------01:12----------
here is gonna take three point forty two

---------01:14----------
volts and pass it through and by the way

---------01:17----------
if you want to be able to know when we

---------01:19----------
release new videos and do new streams

---------01:20----------
make sure to ring the bell so after you

---------01:22----------
subscribed is a little bell and if you

---------01:24----------
don't ring the bell it's as if you

---------01:26----------
didn't subscribe at all that's a new

---------01:27----------
YouTube thing so ring the bell if you

---------01:29----------
actually want to watch this stuff and if

---------01:31----------
you don't I would kind of wonder why it

---------01:33----------
is you were subscribed to begin with so

---------01:35----------
let's go back here and so we need P P 3

---------01:39----------
V 4 2 to be present and we also need SM

---------01:41----------
CBC AC okay so let's see if that's

---------01:44----------
present now you may notice that Paul

---------01:46----------
Daniels has given us some sufficiently

---------01:48----------
more sophisticated multimeter software

---------01:51----------
here is this not cool I think this is

---------01:53----------
amazing

---------01:54----------
it beats the crap out of what B&K

---------01:56----------
offered really enjoying this new

---------01:59----------
multimeter software so a big thank you

---------02:01----------
to Paul Daniels for making this

---------02:03----------
available you can find him at PL

---------02:05----------
Daniel's comm so let's bring up the

---------02:08----------
microscope camera and take a look at

---------02:10----------
what is going on

---------02:13----------
microscope view first thing we want to

---------02:15----------
do remember PP 3 V 4 2 is needed for the

---------02:18----------
SMC and also for this chip so we're

---------02:20----------
gonna find pp 3 V 4 2 and that's gonna

---------02:22----------
be present on L 7095 so let's find L

---------02:26----------
7095 and it looks like there's a little

---------02:29----------
worm next to it or some sort of weird

---------02:31----------
thingy over there let's measure and see

---------02:33----------
what we get

---------02:34----------
so it seems that we get 3.42 volts on PP

---------02:39----------
3 V 4 2 and Paul Daniels as software is

---------02:41----------
reporting millivolts it seems I praised

---------02:44----------
Paul Daniels too soon

---------02:45----------
yep my multimeter is reading 3.42 V and

---------02:49----------
his software is reading 3.42 MV which

---------02:53----------
means hmm all that money that I paid for

---------03:00----------
this software Paul all that money I paid

---------03:03----------
for this software Paul no hey you put

---------03:08----------
this together for free I'm just messing

---------03:10----------
with you I'm just messing with you I

---------03:12----------
love this software it still beats the

---------03:13----------
hell out of the B and K and you you I'll

---------03:16----------
read out until we figure this out what

---------03:18----------
it is this is good stuff

---------03:21----------
yeah this is on Paul Daniels as github

---------03:23----------
and it's it is good software so we have

---------03:25----------
three point 42 volts so now let's go

---------03:26----------
over to this circuit that is required to

---------03:28----------
allow the charger to talk to the SMC and

---------03:31----------
see if it's working now if you 7000 over

---------03:33----------
here's getting three volts on pin one I

---------03:35----------
don't even need to check anything over

---------03:36----------
here cuz SMC bc AC okay is required for

---------03:40----------
you seven zero zero one a passed PP 3 v

---------03:42----------
4 2 over to you 7000 but a few seven

---------03:44----------
thousands already getting it on pin 1

---------03:46----------
then we don't really need to check it

---------03:48----------
so let's find you 7000 which is gonna be

---------03:52----------
right over here and check it on pin 1 to

---------03:54----------
see if it's turning on the way that it's

---------03:56----------
supposed to so we're gonna measure

---------03:58----------
voltage over there and just remember

---------03:59----------
that MV actually means volts that must

---------04:02----------
be something some Australian thing that

---------04:04----------
I'm not really sure about yep so I think

---------04:06----------
in Australia when it says MV that

---------04:09----------
actually means vault it's probably one

---------04:10----------
of those silly Fahrenheit vs. Celsius

---------04:13----------
things that they got going on too

---------04:15----------
so over here it looks like we're getting

---------04:17----------
3.42 so the circuit that allows the

---------04:20----------
charger to talk to the SMC is working

---------04:22----------
fine we can't blame them at this point

---------04:24----------
what I'd like to do is figure out if the

---------04:26----------
SN

---------04:26----------
see itself is actually working is the

---------04:29----------
SMC being told to turn on is the SMC

---------04:31----------
broken in any way so we're going to go

---------04:33----------
over to the area the board that turns

---------04:35----------
the SMC on and what turns the SMC on is

---------04:37----------
going to be the SMC reset I see which

---------04:40----------
you can find over here we're going to go

---------04:43----------
over to this chip now this is

---------04:46----------
responsible for turning the SMC on and

---------04:49----------
the SMC is going to turn on the moment

---------04:52----------
that PP 3v4 2 is present but P P 3 V 4 2

---------04:57----------
is not gonna stabilize instantly so if P

---------05:01----------
P 3 V 4 2 comes on and it's kind of you

---------05:04----------
know

---------05:04----------
wibbly-wobbly and the SMC immediately

---------05:06----------
just tries to turn on with it it'll

---------05:08----------
crash so what this chip does is it in

---------05:10----------
this resistor is sends out a signal

---------05:12----------
called SMC reset L now SMC reset

---------05:17----------
underscore L means that when the signal

---------05:20----------
is low

---------05:21----------
make sure the SMC is in reset mode so

---------05:26----------
this resistor pulls up SMC reset l to

---------05:29----------
ensure the SMC is not in reset mode this

---------05:32----------
chip pulls that signal down to zero so

---------05:34----------
that the SMC remains in reset mode if

---------05:37----------
the so the whole idea here is to keep

---------05:39----------
the SMC and reset mode to keep it from

---------05:41----------
turning on before the rail has

---------05:44----------
stabilized

---------05:45----------
once the PP 3 V 4 to rel is stabilized

---------05:47----------
SMC reset elegans away the SMC exits

---------05:51----------
reset mode and everything works

---------05:53----------
beautifully but we need SMC reset al to

---------05:55----------
be on for that quarter of a second one

---------05:56----------
the Machine first gets power so that the

---------06:00----------
SMC doesn't crash it's kind of like a

---------06:02----------
brownout detector so let's take a look

---------06:04----------
at what's going on in that area and see

---------06:07----------
if sm what SMC reset L is so we can find

---------06:11----------
SMC reset l right over here we can find

---------06:14----------
its voltage and let's see what we get

---------06:21----------
okay so SMC reset L is 0.42 volts which

---------06:27----------
I'm sure that somehow we could blame on

---------06:29----------
Paul Daniels most likely it's Paul

---------06:31----------
Daniels is Fault for the fact that we

---------06:33----------
don't have it so on one side of the

---------06:34----------
wrist is that we get 3.42 on the other

---------06:37----------
side of the resistor we get point for it

---------06:38----------
too so it seems

---------06:40----------
like SMC reset l is being pulled down

---------06:43----------
now there are two reasons for SMC reset

---------06:47----------
l to be pulled down the first could be

---------06:49----------
at the SMC reset ice-t which is a

---------06:51----------
teeny-tiny 8 pin chip easy breezy

---------06:54----------
beautiful to replace is bad the second

---------06:56----------
could be that you 5,000 the SMC is bad

---------06:59----------
which is a chip with 96 balls and that

---------07:02----------
you must take from a donor board and

---------07:04----------
reball which would be utterly miserable

---------07:06----------
so I'm gonna hope and pray that it's you

---------07:08----------
51 10 I'm gonna remove you 51 10 and see

---------07:10----------
if that does anything someone asked the

---------07:12----------
strange parts guide is upgraded an

---------07:14----------
iPhone from 64 to 128 is there a market

---------07:16----------
for that service No

---------07:18----------
so here's why firstly you got to pay a

---------07:20----------
good amount of money for the chip

---------07:21----------
secondly you have to disassemble the

---------07:23----------
phone thirdly you have to program it

---------07:24----------
fourthly you have to solder it on fifth

---------07:27----------
you have to take responsibility for

---------07:29----------
everything that goes wrong with the

---------07:30----------
phone and six people are gonna look that

---------07:32----------
service to cause the total of something

---------07:34----------
like a hundred bucks not economically

---------07:36----------
viable it's economically viable if

---------07:38----------
you're in China it is not economically

---------07:41----------
viable with the cost of rent workman's

---------07:44----------
comp insurance a Larese cost of living

---------07:46----------
taxes etc that you have in America

---------07:49----------
particularly in New York City that it's

---------07:51----------
the same thing as with upgrading ram on

---------07:53----------
a macbook like is it technically

---------07:54----------
possible to upgrade the RAM in a macbook

---------07:56----------
air technically yes is it in any way

---------07:58----------
shape or form remotely economically

---------08:00----------
viable within the United States my

---------08:03----------
argument is now if you can make it work

---------08:05----------
for you great but that would just kind

---------08:06----------
of be some kind of slave labor camp if I

---------08:08----------
try to do it there's again you have to

---------08:10----------
be able to you're gonna be paying a good

---------08:12----------
amount of money for the chip you have to

---------08:14----------
pre this is programming of it involved

---------08:16----------
there soldering involved it's all this

---------08:18----------
stuff and people are gonna want that to

---------08:20----------
be done for like 100 bucks so that is a

---------08:24----------
terrible idea in my opinion if you're in

---------08:27----------
the United States to like I wouldn't

---------08:30----------
plan to get rich off it again you could

---------08:33----------
prove me wrong but my my base advice

---------08:35----------
would be that that's not a great way to

---------08:37----------
make money

---------08:40----------
so let's remove the SMC reset I see and

---------08:45----------
go from there

---------08:55----------
we're gonna preheat a little bit and far

---------08:58----------
away

---------09:05----------
and remember if you're on YouTube and

---------09:08----------
you want to see more in this type of

---------09:09----------
repair and you've subscribed but you

---------09:11----------
don't get notifications remember to ring

---------09:12----------
the bell if you ring the bell there's at

---------09:15----------
least a fighting chance that you'll

---------09:17----------
actually know and we go online but if

---------09:18----------
you don't ring the bell well then you'll

---------09:21----------
never see our stuff and it'll get buried

---------09:23----------
and well that's no good

---------09:36----------
I feel like such a shill saying ring the

---------09:38----------
bell ring the bell okay

---------09:44----------
so I've removed the SMC reset I see so

---------09:46----------
at this point there should be nothing

---------09:47----------
pulling it to ground

---------09:49----------
so if SMC reset L is high is low if SMC

---------09:55----------
reset Ellis low over here that means the

---------09:57----------
only thing that could be doing it is the

---------09:58----------
SMC which would need replacement and

---------10:00----------
that would be terrible

---------10:02----------
it would almost be as terrible as if you

---------10:05----------
didn't ring the bell all right so I'm

---------10:07----------
gonna turn the power back on and let's

---------10:11----------
see what we get at SMC reset out Oh

---------10:17----------
gotta turn the meter on

---------10:22----------
3.38 volts so that means that the issue

---------10:26----------
with this board was the SMC reset I see

---------10:29----------
that was it so once we replace the SMC

---------10:32----------
reset I see

---------10:33----------
we should have a working mother board

---------10:36----------
and just so you know just in case

---------10:39----------
you're kind of curious you'd like to buy

---------10:43----------
an SMC reset I see but you're not quite

---------10:45----------
sure where to get an SMC reset I see if

---------10:50----------
you're thinking of getting an SMC reset

---------10:52----------
I see if this is the type of thing that

---------10:53----------

---------12:27----------
don't delay shop today now let's go back

---------12:31----------
and get ourselves another chip so I'm

---------12:34----------
just gonna 10 the pads over here just in

---------12:38----------
the pads

---------12:53----------
we are gonna get this SMC reset I see

---------12:56----------
chip replaced even faster than Israel

---------12:58----------
will trick the United States in a war in

---------13:00----------
Syria let's go alright so we are just

---------13:08----------
gonna

---------13:12----------
ten hour pads there we got a little bit

---------13:14----------
too much solder on the center pin but uh

---------13:17----------
we're just gonna push that out like we

---------13:19----------
always do and it'll be just fine so

---------13:22----------
let's get ourselves donor board remove

---------13:27----------
the chip from that donor board

---------13:41----------
and we're gonna solder it on it's gonna

---------13:43----------
be a nice beautiful chip a nice

---------13:45----------
beautiful board our SMC reset will be

---------13:49----------
back up to 3.3 volts in no time

---------14:04----------
I bought a TS 100 but I didn't use your

---------14:06----------
affiliate link thanks for the review

---------14:08----------
well thank you very much Alex a poll

---------14:10----------
thank you for that $5

---------14:17----------
[Music]

---------14:33----------
alright that ship has been soldered on

---------14:36----------
as crooked as the deep state and we're

---------14:38----------
just gonna clean up some of those little

---------14:43----------
solder blob sticking out over there

---------14:45----------
not a bing bada boom

---------15:09----------
still as crooked as the deep state but

---------15:11----------
should work fine it's gonna wait cool

---------15:14----------
this thing off a little bit and once

---------15:17----------
it's cooled off we're gonna try turning

---------15:19----------
it on see if we get ourselves one of

---------15:20----------
them beautiful fans spin moments and if

---------15:23----------
we get a fan spin then we can start on

---------15:26----------
another board

---------15:41----------
you may wonder how did that fail well

---------15:49----------
it's a gigantic

---------16:03----------
why don't we do the Jay tags on this

---------16:05----------
channel

---------16:12----------
well the city but will the fate be of

---------16:15----------
that jtag connector do we tolerate JTAG

---------16:21----------
connectors and hey this is a really

---------16:24----------
interesting one check this out check

---------16:25----------
this out folks check this out so this is

---------16:29----------
the pin right over here it's the fourth

---------16:32----------
pin over that's got food on it and the

---------16:36----------
jtag connector has SMC reset l on the

---------16:40----------
fourth pin so that is the that chip got

---------16:42----------
killed by food it got killed by a piece

---------16:46----------
of food that's all it takes to kill an

---------16:49----------
Apple product nothing nothing look at

---------16:54----------
that look at that this is it this is it

---------17:05----------
SMC reset L on pin 24 pin 24 has a piece

---------17:11----------
of food on it look at this and ants

---------17:18----------
could have carried that in there

---------17:19----------
oh my god so what are we going to do to

---------17:24----------
that connector what do we do to JTAG

---------17:28----------
connectors on this channel

---------17:53----------
we are gonna frame the jtag connector

---------18:01----------
and there you go that was the cause that

---------18:06----------
was it

---------18:07----------
that's all it takes that's it

---------18:35----------
bye-bye JTAG all right so now all we got

---------18:39----------
to do next is check and see if we get

---------18:41----------
ourselves a fans Ben so we're gonna plug

---------18:44----------
in our MagSafe connector see if we get

---------18:47----------
ourselves a light it appears that we

---------18:51----------
have a light see that that's a light

---------18:58----------
there's actually looks like health how

---------19:00----------
9,000 right there that's creepy

---------19:04----------
incredibly creepy and if we move over

---------19:07----------
here you'll see that we have that's

---------19:13----------
beautiful

---------19:14----------
that's exactly we were looking for a

---------19:16----------
beautiful spinning fan see this yeah

---------19:25----------
look at that

---------19:27----------
bada bing bada bing that's it let's

---------19:34----------
purpose of that connector if you can

---------19:35----------
just remove it it's to help Apple

---------19:37----------
diagnose things at the factory and also

---------19:39----------
to help Apple program these machines if

---------19:41----------
they ever return to them for

---------19:42----------
refurbishing at the factory and I just

---------19:45----------
feel so bad I just feel so bad that if

---------19:47----------
this machine returns to Apple it's just

---------19:49----------
gonna be a little bit difficult to fix

---------19:50----------
it

---------19:51----------
my heart just it's just poor it just

---------19:53----------
pours out of my chest has palpitations

---------19:56----------
it gets clogged just thinking about that

---------19:59----------
poor employee at the factory whose job

---------20:01----------
fixing this maybe just a tiny bit harder

---------20:06----------
all right that's it for today as always

---------20:09----------
I hope you learned something and if you

---------20:11----------
would like to see these videos more

---------20:13----------
often make sure to ring the bell because

---------20:17----------
if you don't YouTube will never notify

---------20:19----------
you that I've done a video that's it for

---------20:22----------
today and I'll see you next time
