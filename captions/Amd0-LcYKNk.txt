---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be trying a

---------00:01----------
different way of doing these videos I

---------00:02----------
move the camera up here so you can see

---------00:05----------
the multimeter you can see what's on the

---------00:06----------
table you can see the tools so I don't

---------00:08----------
always have to move this crap around and

---------00:09----------
jiggle the camera so that you can see

---------00:11----------
the meter also when we decide to do a

---------00:13----------
video over there in the other station

---------00:15----------
rather than me having to move the camera

---------00:16----------
and redo the wires in the setup I can

---------00:18----------
just take that from where it is right

---------00:20----------
now and go do cuz right now if I try to

---------00:23----------
make a direct line over there the

---------00:25----------
monitor the speakers and all the stuff

---------00:26----------
gets in the way but from up there I can

---------00:28----------
just go a little tilt it's interesting

---------00:30----------
since I do have how do I how I put this

---------00:33----------
there is uh there quite a few videos

---------00:36----------
that we've done that just failed for

---------00:38----------
really stupid reasons so there are

---------00:41----------
videos that we've done that failed

---------00:42----------
because the drew the drive was full

---------00:45----------
there a bunch of videos before I

---------00:46----------
reinstalled the capture card drivers

---------00:48----------
that failed simply because halfway

---------00:50----------
through the capture it was not capturing

---------00:52----------
and you and I can catch it like when I'm

---------00:54----------
sitting in front of your I can catch it

---------00:56----------
but if I'm watching while Jason is doing

---------00:58----------
something I don't catch it and that

---------01:00----------
sucks now so I got the the capture thing

---------01:04----------
fixed the reinstalled the driver the

---------01:06----------
card still sucks it does some banding

---------01:07----------
stuff sometimes but it's not worth

---------01:09----------
spending 900 bucks on a different card

---------01:10----------
to fix I got this little HDMI HDMI

---------01:14----------
splitter box so it has four inputs and

---------01:17----------
two outputs so I can change what each

---------01:20----------
monitor sees so I can you I can display

---------01:23----------
my microscope on Jason's monitor which

---------01:26----------
is also the student station I can have

---------01:28----------
Jason's microscope show up on my capture

---------01:30----------
card in my monitor I can split his to

---------01:33----------
both it's really cool so right now

---------01:35----------
instead of having a rewire everything to

---------01:37----------
do a different video I just hit a button

---------01:39----------
and turn that around so I'm very happy

---------01:41----------
for workflow at least hopefully the next

---------01:42----------
time we do a video it doesn't actually

---------01:44----------
I'm kind of happy because the last video

---------01:46----------
that I think my computer is on my side

---------01:48----------
because the last video would it made me

---------01:50----------
look like an idiot and the computer

---------01:51----------
 up and didn't record it and it's

---------01:53----------
like no I can't really be that mad at

---------01:56----------
that so this machine supposedly has no

---------01:58----------
backlight it was sent bored only which

---------02:00----------
sucks because I'm gonna send it back and

---------02:03----------
it's still gonna have no backlight

---------02:04----------
that's usually what happens with these

---------02:05----------
things I don't think people appreciate

---------02:06----------
just how small this place is until they

---------02:08----------
show up so I have three rooms and this

---------02:11----------
is the room that was supposed to be the

---------02:13----------
thing but a desk in a chair and like

---------02:17----------
QuickBooks not component level board

---------02:20----------
repair filming for YouTube and alright

---------02:22----------
so my this was sent in for no backlight

---------02:25----------
and right now I have no light on the

---------02:27----------
charger ok let's let's see what's going

---------02:30----------
on here is it my fault or is this one of

---------02:34----------
those lovely no backlight boards where

---------02:36----------
they say it's no backlight but it's dead

---------02:38----------
this is why I got rid of the no

---------02:40----------
backlight coupon by the way for anybody

---------02:41----------
who's wondering why don't you fix boards

---------02:44----------
that have no backlight for less money

---------02:45----------
when it's easier because it never ever

---------02:49----------
ever ever is it really isn't it's one of

---------02:54----------
those things where they will say no

---------02:56----------
backlight I'll say it's dead they'll say

---------02:59----------
you're scamming me to get more money so

---------03:01----------
rather than deal with all that conflict

---------03:03----------
I just say all board repairs the same

---------03:05----------
price so I don't care if it's dead I

---------03:08----------
don't care if it's no backlight there is

---------03:10----------
no scam there is no scam because saint

---------03:13----------
price either way completely removes my

---------03:15----------
motivation to lie all right so we have

---------03:18----------
16 volts coming in from the charger pp3

---------03:21----------
before to is putting out 1.2 4 volts

---------03:24----------
instead of 3.42 volts hmm alright oh joy

---------03:31----------
thank God I don't have a no backlight

---------03:34----------
coupon Oh Mike that was the stupidest

---------03:36----------
idea I ever had in my life

---------03:39----------
if the only problem is no backlight we

---------03:42----------
will fix it for cheaper they send it in

---------03:44----------
saying it's only no backlight and then

---------03:46----------
we get it and it's dead I'm sorry it's

---------03:49----------
dead this does not fall under we okay I

---------03:55----------
would say almost every policy that I've

---------03:58----------
set here it came as a result of being

---------03:59----------
cursed out by somebody over the phone

---------04:01----------
like every policy that I've said that

---------04:03----------
even seems the tiniest bit mean I

---------04:06----------
probably got cursed out that's probably

---------04:08----------
where that came from

---------04:09----------
alright so we're gonna do is we're just

---------04:11----------
going to look through how P P 3 V 4 2 is

---------04:13----------
created on this board and try to follow

---------04:17----------
along so let's find it where are you

---------04:25----------
all right so this let's see if you can

---------04:30----------
see that I you don't have two monitors

---------04:31----------
anymore one of my monitors died so

---------04:33----------
hopefully you see what I see so I have

---------04:35----------
16 volts on dcn I just measured that now

---------04:38----------
I want to see where is the okay that's

---------04:40----------
gonna go through this stuff so this is

---------04:43----------
three point 42 volt power supply over

---------04:45----------
here right so this is input C 18 volts

---------04:51----------
going through here going to V in which

---------04:53----------
stands for voltage in so let's see what

---------04:55----------
I have on D seven zero zero five

---------04:59----------
I'm just gonna check it some random

---------05:01----------
points so this is D seven zero zero five

---------05:04----------
now I want to see what I have coming

---------05:05----------
from the charger C charger charger

---------05:12----------
charger charger charger charger and r700

---------05:19----------
five so that's gonna come up on pin to

---------05:24----------
pin 2 is gonna be up here and I have 16

---------05:31----------
volts coming in there now let's take a

---------05:34----------
look at what the u 7090 area looks like

---------05:39----------
let's make sure you see what I see I see

---------05:41----------
what you see you see I see we all see

---------05:45----------
hi-c

---------05:54----------
oh um remote on mon output ac3 what does

---------06:08----------
that mean the capture card died again

---------06:10----------
now I got two things to worry about my

---------06:13----------
shitty capture card aha and this shitty

---------06:18----------
thing alright here we go

---------06:19----------
it takes a while to switch that's what

---------06:21----------
you get when you buy a four in two out

---------06:22----------
HDMI switcher for 35 bucks on Amazon so

---------06:26----------
but it does work it's pretty cool okay

---------06:29----------
let's mate let's make sure it's in focus

---------06:30----------
for me let's make sure it's in focus for

---------06:33----------
you yeah I don't see anything wrong with

---------06:37----------
that I'm not I'm not mad at that at all

---------06:38----------
which is interesting alright let's see

---------06:40----------
if we have a shorter grounds with the

---------06:41----------
multimeter and diode mode put the red

---------06:45----------
probe on ground black probe on PP three

---------06:47----------
before two output and it's not short to

---------06:50----------
ground over there but it's not creating

---------06:52----------
3.42 volts hmm okay let's see so this

---------07:01----------
doesn't look very clean to me so you see

---------07:04----------
right over here

---------07:05----------
see that's not this in this it just

---------07:10----------
looks like somebody had their way with

---------07:11----------
it so I want to see what those areas are

---------07:14----------
for and if they actually go to anything

---------07:17----------
so let's see if those areas actually go

---------07:21----------
to anything here okay so the areas that

---------07:25----------
where something looks a little funny are

---------07:27----------
this this is our seventy eighty one and

---------07:37----------
also our 1796 so if you look on the

---------07:46----------
schematic our seventy eighty one is no

---------07:48----------
stuff right this is no stuff so I don't

---------07:51----------
care about this this is part of the

---------07:53----------
circuitry for the shutdown pen shdn

---------07:55----------
stands for shutdown which you can find

---------07:57----------
if you google this number the idea is

---------07:59----------
that the voltage at this pin needs to be

---------08:01----------
over two volts in order for the chip to

---------08:03----------
turn on work so what they do is they

---------08:05----------
take the sixteen volts coming from the

---------08:06----------
voltage in over

---------08:08----------
here and they just let that go to the

---------08:10----------
shutdown pin make sense now

---------08:13----------
the other resistor that is missing over

---------08:16----------
here is our 1796 our 1796 is a 200 kilo

---------08:20----------
ohm resistor in the feedback circuit so

---------08:23----------
here is going to be output PP 3 V 4 2

---------08:25----------
this is where it gets output and this is

---------08:27----------
a voltage divider that is going to take

---------08:29----------
some of that output and send it back

---------08:31----------
over here to FB now if FB is it let's

---------08:35----------
try to make the sound very simple and

---------08:36----------
this is probably an explanation it's

---------08:37----------
gonna piss off a lot of the engineer

---------08:38----------
folk that watch the channel now the way

---------08:41----------
feedback works in these circuits is very

---------08:42----------
simple if you don't had feedback it's

---------08:44----------
going to stop it's not going to do

---------08:46----------
anything so let's say that you're

---------08:48----------
driving a car your idea you're moving

---------08:50----------
the car but your feedback is the fact

---------08:53----------
that you're watching the road you can

---------08:54----------
see where you're going if I cover your

---------08:56----------
eyes so that you cannot see where you're

---------08:57----------
going you're going to stop driving

---------08:59----------
because you don't want to crash into

---------09:00----------
somebody your inclination may be to pull

---------09:02----------
over and hit the brakes immediately the

---------09:04----------
same thing is true here if the chip

---------09:06----------
cannot see what it's doing then it's not

---------09:08----------
going to work it's gonna stop doing

---------09:09----------
whatever it's doing and here the chip is

---------09:11----------
receiving something different on

---------09:13----------
feedback than it should so let's go over

---------09:15----------
what's going on here now if you look

---------09:17----------
over here this is a voltage divider so

---------09:20----------
what this is going to do is it's going

---------09:21----------
to send a portion of the output a

---------09:23----------
portion of the 3.42 volts to feedback if

---------09:26----------
now what the whole point of a voltage

---------09:28----------
divider is to lower voltage so this

---------09:31----------
resistor is going to take the voltage

---------09:32----------
from here and directly apply it here

---------09:34----------
this second resistor is going to take

---------09:36----------
some of this voltage that was applied to

---------09:37----------
here and is going to bring that to

---------09:39----------
ground if this resistor is gone then we

---------09:42----------
are going to have a higher voltage going

---------09:43----------
from output to feedback then if this

---------09:45----------
resistor is here if this resistor is

---------09:48----------
present it's going to take some of this

---------09:49----------
voltage and send it to ground which is

---------09:51----------
going to lower it but that resistor is

---------09:53----------
not present which means feedback is C

---------09:54----------
it's thinking it's making more than it's

---------09:57----------
than it is so the feedback pin is going

---------10:00----------
to be expecting see this much voltage

---------10:02----------
right so the feedback pin expects to see

---------10:04----------
this much when the voltage divider is

---------10:06----------
working because the bottom resistor in

---------10:07----------
the voltage divider is not there it's

---------10:09----------
seeing this much voltage now the whole

---------10:12----------
idea behind the feedback circuit is it's

---------10:14----------
going to regulate itself based on what

---------10:15----------
it sees so if it thinks that it's

---------10:18----------
receiving this if it thinks it's getting

---------10:20----------
this much when it

---------10:21----------
supposed to be receiving this much what

---------10:23----------
is it going to do to output it's going a

---------10:24----------
lower output because feedback is seeing

---------10:26----------
more voltage than it's supposed to so a

---------10:28----------
feedback sees more voltage than it's

---------10:29----------
used to seeing it's going to lower the

---------10:31----------
output so that's why we're getting 1.2

---------10:33----------
volts on P B 3 B 4 - instead of 3 point

---------10:36----------
4 volts and that's why you never ever

---------10:38----------
ever ever ever do something as

---------10:41----------
stupid as a no backlight discount coupon

---------10:44----------
because it should get no backlight no

---------10:47----------
backlight imagine if we provided a

---------10:49----------
discount based on the fact that this is

---------10:51----------
no backlight they would say that IgAN I

---------10:53----------
can hear the phone conversation now I

---------10:56----------
would be in for a 40 minute screaming

---------10:57----------
match saying that I ripped that

---------10:59----------
component off the board

---------11:00----------
I personally ripped that component off

---------11:02----------
the board so that I could charge more

---------11:04----------
money and just did and the reason I

---------11:06----------
mentioned this is because I know that

---------11:07----------
there are people watching this channel

---------11:09----------
that want to start their own businesses

---------11:10----------
doing something like this and I want to

---------11:12----------
save you the misery and the

---------11:14----------
hassle of all of these mistakes and that

---------11:17----------
was a terrible terrible terrible awful

---------11:20----------
will never make again mistake it's just

---------11:22----------
no never never deal with that again so

---------11:24----------
let's get ourselves a 200 kill oh my -

---------11:27----------
hundred kill on but there's zero 6:03

---------11:29----------
which won't fit so I will find myself a

---------11:31----------
200 kilo ohm that is zero two zero one

---------11:37----------
right here and there we go so the first

---------11:42----------
thing we're gonna do is put that 200

---------11:44----------
kilo ohm resistor on the board which

---------11:45----------
means turning on my air filter I love

---------11:47----------
having a foot pedal do that and let's

---------11:52----------
get it started so this screen is a test

---------11:56----------
of screen by the way so if any if you

---------11:58----------
want to wonder why I don't appear to

---------12:00----------
care about damaging it or scratching it

---------12:03----------
it's it's it's as damaged and scratched

---------12:06----------
as it can get that that's its job is to

---------12:08----------
just is to get scratched and abused by

---------12:09----------
me I know I know I'm terrible it's the

---------12:14----------
first thing we do is use this iron

---------12:15----------
that's way too big and we use it to tin

---------12:18----------
the pads

---------12:24----------
well the most obnoxious iron therefore

---------12:27----------
zero to zero one soldering Jason keeps

---------12:31----------
taking it and putting that that tip on

---------12:33----------
he loves that tip for removing stuff he

---------12:36----------
uses that tip all the time for removing

---------12:39----------
I see is it's actually really really

---------12:40----------
smart what he does is to remove a lot of

---------12:42----------
different ICS rather than use heat like

---------12:45----------
a hot air he just touches the top of the

---------12:48----------
IC with that and the IC comes right off

---------12:51----------
the board without heating the rest of

---------12:52----------
surrounding components it's a really

---------12:54----------
smart way to go but Jason's a smart guy

---------12:58----------
so I expect smart things at him like

---------13:00----------
that

---------13:10----------
I didn't grab this very well

---------13:33----------
yeah I didn't that's gonna fly away I'm

---------13:39----------
not on my soldering game today

---------13:49----------
definitely not on my soldering game

---------13:52----------
today

---------14:06----------
and after this we get to figure out what

---------14:08----------
no backlight is

---------14:22----------
more appropriate iron this is the FM

---------14:24----------
2032 with the t30 - can tip and you'll

---------14:28----------
see that this is much more appropriate

---------14:30----------
so I added some flux there and we do

---------14:32----------
that remove the excess solder just make

---------14:35----------
a nice little joint now when I plug it

---------14:37----------
in I should get a higher voltage than

---------14:39----------
1.2 volts on PP 3 before - the green

---------14:42----------
light is coming on the board so that

---------14:45----------
that's a good thing now I'm just gonna

---------14:48----------
show you that pp 3 before 2 is restored

---------14:52----------
and as you can see my screen just

---------14:56----------
activated so I'm not sure if the light

---------14:57----------
came on but it did just activate and

---------14:59----------
believe it or not the light actually did

---------15:01----------
come on the screen and I'm gonna leave

---------15:03----------
it on long enough for you to see the

---------15:04----------
question mark so this board was sent in

---------15:07----------
saying no back light and the reason that

---------15:09----------
it has no back light is because it was

---------15:12----------
dead and again this is why I tell you

---------15:15----------
provide good customer service be good to

---------15:17----------
your customers be kind of your customers

---------15:19----------
be polite try to be helpful as often as

---------15:21----------
you can but where you draw the line is

---------15:24----------
letting the customer tell you what is

---------15:25----------
wrong if the customer says I have no

---------15:28----------
backlight fix no backlight again you're

---------15:30----------
gonna do you see that

---------15:34----------
okay well it's dim because of the studio

---------15:36----------
lighting but you get the idea

---------15:39----------
Studio V I have a question mark there if

---------15:44----------
you let the customer choose what's wrong

---------15:47----------
it's it's not gonna be their fault you

---------15:50----------
are you're the one who agreed to it

---------15:51----------
therefore they're gonna say something is

---------15:53----------
gonna be wrong be polite be respectful

---------15:54----------
be kind help them with their problem fix

---------15:57----------
their problem take it seriously but if

---------15:59----------
don't let them choose what the issue is

---------16:02----------
don't cuz if you let the customer choose

---------16:05----------
the issue and then set the price then

---------16:07----------
it's not that they were wrong it was

---------16:09----------
that you up fixing it or even

---------16:12----------
worse that you that you sabotage it

---------16:13----------
again I've had that conversation I've

---------16:15----------
had that conversation at least 50 times

---------16:17----------
it's just very very bad you know you

---------16:20----------
know and technically they are correct

---------16:22----------
this does have no backlight and the

---------16:23----------
reason the reason this had no backlight

---------16:25----------
the reason this had no backlight is

---------16:27----------
because it was dead now it's not dead

---------16:30----------
therefore it doesn't have no light and I

---------16:32----------
did go through that with somebody they

---------16:33----------
actually said you know on well you

---------16:36----------
you know it is dead yeah it has no light

---------16:38----------
and I'm like but I mean I feel so bad

---------16:42----------
for all those people that have those

---------16:43----------
discount coupons where they say this

---------16:45----------
board repair is cheaper than usual but

---------16:47----------
it only applies if you have no back

---------16:49----------
light again you're just dis what just be

---------16:53----------
very careful I'm not gonna tell you what

---------16:55----------
to do I'm just gonna say be very very

---------16:56----------
careful in what you offer you don't want

---------16:58----------
to offer anything where there's we're

---------17:01----------
there's room for people to suspect that

---------17:03----------
you have a motivation to lie to them and

---------17:05----------
that that's it for today and as always I

---------17:07----------
hope you learned something about

---------17:08----------
feedback circuits and hopefully this new

---------17:10----------
camera angle is not complete crap but

---------17:14----------
we'll see you
