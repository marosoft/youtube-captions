---------00:00----------
a Macbook to fix so it looks like the

---------00:02----------
place that worked on this also uses

---------00:04----------
repair shop er I can tell from the typo

---------00:07----------
ticket they have over here let's see

---------00:09----------
what's wrong with this MacBook this

---------00:11----------
MacBook has come a long way to make it

---------00:13----------
to this table

---------00:14----------
turn off the fume extractor so I can

---------00:16----------
smell the Thai food from over here come

---------00:18----------
yell is eating Thai food but he wants to

---------00:20----------
he wants him to enjoy all the fumes for

---------00:22----------
himself so he keeps the fume extractor

---------00:24----------
on that stuff smells good so I'd like to

---------00:26----------
smell some as well so first thing to do

---------00:28----------
here is plug it in and see how many amps

---------00:31----------
it uses see if it turns on but before we

---------00:34----------
do that we have to remove the bottom the

---------00:35----------
first thing we notice from the Swedish

---------00:37----------
store is that it's missing a screw here

---------00:39----------
here here and here

---------00:42----------
I suppose that's how they pay for their

---------00:45----------
free education and free healthcare

---------00:46----------
stealing MacBook screws that's something

---------00:49----------
you won't hear about in the American

---------00:50----------
media the first thing that we see on the

---------00:52----------
inside here is that it's an a20 3437

---------00:54----------
board this appears to be a battery that

---------00:57----------
looks like they did the stuff that I do

---------00:59----------
to my batteries so I'm gonna unplug the

---------01:01----------
battery now the first thing that we can

---------01:03----------
see here when we look at this MacBook is

---------01:05----------
that there seems to be corrosion on a

---------01:09----------
connector that we've been over a couple

---------01:10----------
of times on this channel hmm can anybody

---------01:13----------
name this connector over here that it

---------01:15----------
seems to have corrosion on it stay tech

---------01:25----------
look at what we found on the Swedish

---------01:27----------
MacBook this Swedish MacBook appears to

---------01:29----------
have some issues in the jtag connector

---------01:30----------
the jtag connector is what connects

---------01:33----------
numerous different points in the machine

---------01:34----------
SMC signals spi ROM 3.42 volt line 5

---------01:38----------
volt line many different things

---------01:40----------
if this corrosion along this connector

---------01:42----------
kind of like the difference between

---------01:43----------
getting shot in the arm versus getting

---------01:45----------
shot in the head if you get shot in the

---------01:47----------
arm ow

---------01:47----------
but fixable you get shot in the head

---------01:49----------
you're done for so let's see what

---------01:52----------
happens when we remove this connector

---------01:53----------
and we're gonna remove this connector

---------01:55----------
violently very violently cuz that's how

---------01:58----------
we always remove JTAG connectors while

---------02:01----------
destruction and death to the jtag

---------02:03----------
connector which could be put anywhere on

---------02:05----------
the machine but is put right on the edge

---------02:07----------
where liquid is going to get into it

---------02:09----------
because Apple dye jtech dye get off of

---------02:12----------
my board

---------02:13----------
you bastard we are going to bulldoze you

---------02:17----------
yes die jtech die death to you jtech now

---------02:23----------
we're gonna use some of the wick that's

---------02:25----------
approved by Jesse Jones that iPad rehab

---------02:27----------
this is called gute wick you can buy it

---------02:29----------
on store dot Rossman group com

---------02:31----------
it's back in stock and approved and

---------02:34----------
endorsed by Jesse Jones of iPad rehab

---------02:39----------
the JTAG is now gone next thing we do if

---------02:43----------
we look to the right the pp3 before to

---------02:45----------
zurich it appears to have a little bit

---------02:46----------
of corrosion by it and the pp3 before to

---------02:49----------
circuit is going to be required for the

---------02:50----------
SMC to work and the SMC has to talk to

---------02:52----------
the charger in order to give us a green

---------02:54----------
light so I just scraped a little bit of

---------02:56----------
that away now I'm going to take the

---------02:58----------
board out before I put power through

---------02:59----------
this board long screw in the short hole

---------03:07----------
yep they did open I was just trying to

---------03:09----------
just curious

---------03:10----------
so as you there also has been the long

---------03:12----------
screw in the short hole this screw does

---------03:16----------
not go in this hole it does not this

---------03:20----------
don't put the long screw in the short

---------03:22----------
hole

---------03:22----------
I was gonna say my assumption was that

---------03:23----------
it was never removed from the board but

---------03:25----------
it had to have been the board had to

---------03:27----------
have been removed at some point in order

---------03:29----------
for that screw to go over there much

---------03:31----------
sadness now I like to have the fans

---------03:33----------
sitting there while I'm working so I'm

---------03:35----------
gonna take the right screw the short

---------03:37----------
screw and put it into the short screw

---------03:39----------
hole so the fan can main that stay where

---------03:40----------
it's supposed to stay I'm not gonna put

---------03:42----------
the long screw in the short hole putting

---------03:44----------
the long screw in the short hole makes

---------03:46----------
little MacBook sad you don't want to

---------03:49----------
make little MacBook sad I can see it

---------03:52----------
already can you see it can Paul see it

---------03:55----------
let's see you sees it first from far

---------03:58----------
away five volt regulator what is this

---------04:05----------
gross yuck for months and you couldn't

---------04:10----------
find this really dear God we got open a

---------04:14----------
store in Sweden people's can't fix

---------04:16----------
MacBooks for in Sweden yes Paul how

---------04:20----------
do you feel about moving to Sweden this

---------04:22----------
is an eight to zero 34 37 so we're can

---------04:24----------
open up the schematic

---------04:25----------
what's corroded is right by the 5 all

---------04:27----------
right

---------04:27----------
you later a TPS five or nine eight zero

---------04:29----------
a chip by the way that's available punch

---------04:31----------
door Osmond group.com don't delay buyer

---------04:35----------
TPS five or nine eight zero from store

---------04:37----------
dot Roskam group calm today with four

---------04:39----------
point nine stars on shopper approved

---------04:41----------
same day free shipping on orders over

---------04:43----------
$30 you can't lose this is c57 503 this

---------04:49----------
is going to be a capacitor that sits

---------04:53----------
between ground and voltage reference we

---------05:01----------
also have corrosion on what's right

---------05:04----------
directly under it C 7,500 which is going

---------05:07----------
to be going to pinch 23 of the chip

---------05:09----------
which is where a PP bus g3 huh of 8.5

---------05:12----------
volts from the battery or eight point

---------05:13----------
five volts from the you 7000 creating it

---------05:15----------
from the charger it is going to go to

---------05:17----------
pin 23 to turn this chip on this chip

---------05:20----------
operates on eight point five volts it

---------05:23----------
can also operate on 12 point 56 volts

---------05:25----------
but I can't operate on zero which is

---------05:27----------
most likely what its operating on if

---------05:28----------
there's corrosion in that area now even

---------05:31----------
if the voltage is going to the chips and

---------05:32----------
say see crush and they're not going to

---------05:33----------
trust and reuse that chip we're going to

---------05:35----------
replace it with a new one however when

---------05:38----------
we do it it's not going to take for

---------05:39----------
months the waiting line to get your

---------05:41----------
macbook fixed in sweden seems even

---------05:42----------
longer than the waiting time to see a

---------05:44----------
doctor if you have prostate cancer

---------05:54----------
you

---------06:00----------
that corrosion are a bug

---------06:13----------
okay

---------06:16----------
take a look here now it seems like this

---------06:20----------
capacitor was no longer able to make

---------06:22----------
contact with the pad because of serious

---------06:25----------
corrosion so we're gonna scrape away at

---------06:29----------
that boards corrosion using my tweezers

---------06:31----------
because my new year's resolution not to

---------06:35----------
scrape with tweezers no my x-acto knife

---------06:41----------
didn't have a blade anymore so that's

---------06:42----------
why I started scraping which Weezer's no

---------06:46----------
but that was my last year's New Year's

---------06:47----------
resolution was to stop scraping which

---------06:49----------
razors alright so this is gonna need a

---------06:55----------
little bit of work so we're gonna do a

---------06:58----------
little bit of scraping scraping a little

---------07:02----------
bit scraping scraping it's great that

---------07:06----------
he's scraping now we're gonna switch

---------07:08----------
over to the micro pencil gonna put the

---------07:10----------
small amount of flux over here and first

---------07:12----------
thing I'm gonna do let's just retain

---------07:13----------
those pads

---------07:30----------
okay we're gonna make these Pro coins

---------07:32----------
happy little probe points again and this

---------07:36----------
cap looks like it should go as well I

---------07:38----------
don't trust this cap I gotta get rid of

---------07:40----------
that junk do this come off the board

---------07:47----------
mofo come on come on

---------07:50----------
get get

---------08:00----------
okay now the parts that were of concern

---------08:03----------
to me these pads that were covered in

---------08:05----------
corrosion now there's flux there and we

---------08:07----------
have solder on the iron and the irons

---------08:09----------
warm so I'm just gonna go back and forth

---------08:10----------
and back and forth back and forth and

---------08:12----------
scrape it he scrape away how it's gonna

---------08:15----------
scrape a little bit of that covering off

---------08:18----------
of the trace that and then solder that

---------08:21----------
to the pad just to make sure even if I

---------08:23----------
did miss some corrosion under the pad

---------08:24----------
that it is directly soldered to the

---------08:25----------
trace regardless of any outside [ __ ]

---------08:30----------
okay we got that going now this piece

---------08:35----------
over here we got to make sure that's

---------08:37----------
still going to its pro point okay just

---------08:44----------
do this a lot of this is me just have an

---------08:46----------
OCD probably not really necessary it

---------08:49----------
will probably still work without this

---------08:50----------
but I want it to be nice not to be a

---------08:53----------
happy little MacBook after it leaves

---------08:58----------
here it's going back to a life of high

---------08:59----------
taxes put those two caps back on and

---------09:02----------
replace our TPS five one nine eight zero

---------09:03----------
with a better one happier one

---------09:07----------
from story dot Rossman group.com

---------09:47----------
the solder balls have come out around

---------09:49----------
the side we can easily suck them up

---------09:51----------
using my micro pencil and a little bit

---------09:53----------
of flux when we kidding a lot of flux

---------10:09----------
the bigger the glob the better the job

---------10:14----------
the bigger the glob the better the job

---------10:28----------
did you stop blowing away mofo

---------10:52----------
now does that not look like a happy

---------10:54----------
little five volt regulator circuit or

---------10:55----------
what now I remember

---------10:57----------
our pp3 before two circuit even though

---------10:59----------
it's working has a little bit of

---------11:00----------
corrosion

---------11:06----------
all right a little bit of flux a little

---------11:14----------
bit of hot air

---------11:21----------
and to top it off going around those

---------11:26----------
pins with a micro pencil to get the

---------11:27----------
corrosion that didn't go away from the

---------11:29----------
hot air and the flux

---------11:36----------
okay

---------11:55----------
all right so now what we're gonna do

---------11:58----------
here is double-check our soldering

---------11:59----------
handiwork and then see if we have fan

---------12:01----------
spin which you probably do soldering

---------12:04----------
handiwork looks well as good as it's

---------12:07----------
going to get now we plug it in to see if

---------12:13----------
we get fan spin

---------12:25----------
it's taking seven hundred milliamps and

---------12:27----------
as you can see we have fan spin now this

---------12:31----------
is an eight to zero 34:37 similar to the

---------12:33----------
h20 3435 from two thousand thirteen and

---------12:36----------
fourteen it's going to turn on off on

---------12:37----------
off on off and then on which is normal

---------12:41----------
for this model so while it's doing its

---------12:48----------
RTC reset I'm going to clean the desk a

---------12:50----------
little bit if it turns out to be an

---------12:52----------
absolute headache don't waste your time

---------12:53----------
on it or give it to Paul the world is

---------12:56----------
better with one less MacBook around oh

---------12:59----------
the lovely letter thank you very much I

---------13:02----------
think it's funny that it wasn't working

---------13:04----------
when the battery ran out so rather than

---------13:06----------
remove the corrosion by the five volt

---------13:08----------
regulator or the JTAG they put in new

---------13:10----------
battery and left the corrosion all over

---------13:11----------
the board yeah they took all the screws

---------13:16----------
well they managed a long screw this one

---------13:18----------
so if you long screwed it I know you

---------13:20----------
took the board out because you long

---------13:21----------
screwed it where do we even begin

---------13:28----------
firstly if you're not if you're not

---------13:32----------
going to address the board issues don't

---------13:34----------
take the board out of the machine

---------13:35----------
because if you're bad at this you'll

---------13:37----------
probably just wind up long screwing it

---------13:38----------
don't replace the battery on something

---------13:40----------
that clearly has liquid damage visible

---------13:42----------
on it that you can see just because

---------13:43----------
customer complains if customer says

---------13:45----------
doesn't work after battery dread don't

---------13:48----------
go me replace battery try and see if

---------13:51----------
there's something wrong with it

---------13:52----------
what did they tell you the issue is they

---------13:54----------
told you they spilled something on it

---------13:56----------
maybe they didn't tell you they spilled

---------13:57----------
something on it

---------13:58----------
customers lie they all do that's why you

---------14:00----------
should be able to see it if you see

---------14:02----------
green don't just replace a battery fix

---------14:05----------
the board and as always remove the jtag

---------14:08----------
connector the JTAG is typically the

---------14:11----------
cause of all of your problems further

---------14:13----------
this probably didn't need more repair it

---------14:15----------
simply protonated an ultrasonic it

---------14:18----------
probably would have even worked again if

---------14:19----------
you just used a little bit of an alcohol

---------14:21----------
and a toothbrush but that's not gonna

---------14:23----------
work if the person's using it for four

---------14:25----------
months

---------14:25----------
keeping it plugged in because you give

---------14:27----------
them a new battery that is lame-o they

---------14:31----------
charged her for the battery to a charger

---------14:35----------
for the battery

---------14:37----------
and they still charged just wiped out I

---------14:43----------
agree
