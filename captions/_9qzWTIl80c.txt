---------00:00----------
here we have an a 1708 that is liquid

---------00:02----------
damage it's not powering on let's take a

---------00:05----------
look at why this is not powering on we

---------00:06----------
can open the ends this machine and see

---------00:08----------
what's on the inside all right first

---------00:10----------
thing that I like to do here is I'm

---------00:12----------
going to unplug the battery because I

---------00:15----------
want to see how much amperage this is

---------00:17----------
using without having a battery plugged

---------00:19----------
in I want to see just what the logic

---------00:21----------
board itself is using not the battery

---------00:25----------
okay 5 volts 40 milliamps it doesn't

---------00:30----------
look like this is going to twenty volts

---------00:31----------
this is stuck at 5 volts 40 milliamps

---------00:35----------
okay so let's get the board out of the

---------00:37----------
case so we can check if we have 53 V 3

---------00:42----------
underscore g3 huh remember DP 3 V 3

---------00:44----------
undersquare g3 hot as the rail that's

---------00:46----------
going to allow the USBC controllers to

---------00:48----------
talk to the charger to request 20 volts

---------00:50----------
rather than 5 volts so the cd32 15 of

---------00:53----------
the chips that are going to communicate

---------00:54----------
with the USBC charger to allow the USBC

---------00:56----------
charger to put out 20 volt instead of 5

---------00:59----------
volts this chip is powered by pp3 v3

---------01:01----------
underscore g3 hot which is the very very

---------01:03----------
clean circuit over here so I'm gonna

---------01:04----------
guess the issue is not that pp3 v3

---------01:06----------
underscore g3 how does not present the

---------01:07----------
Rev that these CD 32 15s are not working

---------01:09----------
the way that they're supposed to so the

---------01:11----------
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

---------01:11----------
try to undo some of that corrosion here

---------01:13----------
by using some flux that you can buy it

---------01:15----------
stored on rossmann group comm and the

---------01:16----------
quick 861 DW hot air rework station

---------01:18----------
which you could also buy it stored on

---------01:19----------
rossmann group comm to reflow these

---------01:21----------
chips I'm just gonna use a tiny bit of

---------01:23----------
flux just a now you know not too much

---------01:24----------
just an appropriate amount to reflow

---------01:26----------
these chips and then we will go from

---------01:28----------
there so you don't want to use too much

---------01:29----------
you want to use just a proper amount of

---------01:31----------
flux and then you'll be all set and

---------01:33----------
ready to go so as you can see there

---------01:34----------
we've put the right amount of flux on

---------01:35----------
the board and now we are going to reflow

---------01:38----------
those chips and it should work very very

---------01:39----------
nicely

---------02:50----------
five four three two one three one but a

---------03:04----------
bing bada boom now we just wait for it

---------03:09----------
to cool off

---------03:09----------
also notice that our reflow to chips at

---------03:12----------
one time so as my dream is to reflow two

---------03:15----------
chips at the same time two chips one

---------03:18----------
flux syringe and one nozzle now it looks

---------03:20----------
like we also got some more corrosion

---------03:22----------
around here and some other spots that is

---------03:25----------
LED driver area yuck

---------03:27----------
TPS 5:09 zero yuck and that's an LED

---------03:30----------
driver that I think just has to be

---------03:32----------
replaced

---------03:35----------
even if that's reusable it's it's too

---------03:38----------
nasty

---------03:52----------
Wow those resistors really wanted to run

---------03:54----------
away look at them they all stood up

---------04:01----------
that was something else I've never had

---------04:03----------
three resistors at once fly away or

---------04:06----------
stand up when I was doing a qfn package

---------04:08----------
that was interesting

---------04:10----------
did you see that if you're a wine by

---------04:12----------
like 10 seconds those three resistors

---------04:13----------
all went well they did something that

---------04:16----------
I'm not going to say on camera because I

---------04:17----------
don't want to end up like count dank

---------04:18----------
EULA but they did something that would

---------04:21----------
have gotten that count that got count

---------04:24----------
dank you'll have put in those resistors

---------04:25----------
did something that got count angular

---------04:27----------
sent to court and maybe prison I don't

---------04:29----------
want to be sent to prison if I ever one

---------04:31----------
day decide that I will want to visit

---------04:32----------
Europe so I will leave that to myself

---------06:05----------
I haven't burned myself in a long time

---------06:07----------
pickle

---------07:12----------
[Music]

---------07:22----------
[Music]

---------07:51----------
oh boy I almost forgot I was here okay

---------07:55----------
so let's see if we get a question my

---------07:57----------
folder on this MacBook or a backlight or

---------07:59----------
a picture

---------08:18----------
45 volts well that's a backlight give me

---------08:22----------
a nice little question mark hey question

---------08:27----------
mark folders so this MacBook was not

---------08:29----------
turning on we had 5 volts in the charger

---------08:33----------
instead of 20 volts via the reflow of

---------08:34----------
the cd32 15 s we had a little bit of

---------08:37----------
corrosion by the backlight circuit we

---------08:38----------
cleaned it up replace the chip set and

---------08:39----------
also cleaned off a little bit more of

---------08:41----------
the corrosion by the TPS 5.99 zero chip

---------08:43----------
so remember if you're not getting 20

---------08:45----------
volts in the charger is PP 3v3

---------08:47----------
underscore g3 hot there do your CD 32 15

---------08:49----------
MUX chips that allow the charger to

---------08:51----------
communicate with the board and and put

---------08:55----------
out 20 volts good if not figure it out

---------08:58----------
and if your CD 32 15 s are bad look no

---------09:00----------
further than store tout Rossmann group
