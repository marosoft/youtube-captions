---------00:00----------
okay so today we're going to be working

---------00:01----------
on a machine that has no image on the

---------00:04----------
screen when you turn it on and it

---------00:05----------
doesn't chime so since it doesn't chime

---------00:07----------
it doesn't go dong when you turn it on

---------00:10----------
is my problem no backlight is my problem

---------00:13----------
no image or is my problem that it's

---------00:16----------
there's no life there's no CPU it's

---------00:18----------
going to be the third one

---------00:19----------
that's so you know don't look at it and

---------00:21----------
say it's no backlight when it doesn't

---------00:23----------
chime don't say when it has no image on

---------00:25----------
the screen and it's no backlight and

---------00:27----------
again don't say when it doesn't even

---------00:28----------
dong that the problem is no image so

---------00:31----------
this came in with the there's a bunch of

---------00:34----------
I actually already ultrasonically clean

---------00:36----------
this I shouldn't have I should have

---------00:37----------
showed you what it originally looked

---------00:38----------
like the CPU and the PCH had both been

---------00:41----------
heat gun to you can see that

---------00:43----------
there was little bits of BGA rework flux

---------00:45----------
around it seeping out from the who

---------00:48----------
decided to heat gun this crap before

---------00:49----------
using his brain so here's what really

---------00:51----------
kills me when you look at this board and

---------00:53----------
again this came here from another repair

---------00:55----------
store that I'm going to be linking to

---------00:57----------
this video at the end of it so you'll

---------01:00----------
see there you should see that there's

---------01:02----------
some really annoying comments at the end

---------01:03----------
of it this is a customer I'm going to be

---------01:05----------
firing from having as a wholesale

---------01:07----------
customer because here's the thing I can

---------01:09----------
fix this

---------01:09----------
but you heat gun the CPU and the PCH now

---------01:12----------
what that means is that there's a good

---------01:14----------
likely that CPU or that PC H failing

---------01:16----------
meaning that I'm gonna have to cover

---------01:18----------
that under my all-inclusive three month

---------01:20----------
warranty meaning you've made more hassle

---------01:22----------
misery and nightmare for me because you

---------01:23----------
were an idiot meaning you can go

---------01:25----------
yourself so anyway I'm sure that there's

---------01:27----------
going to be some negative comments here

---------01:28----------
right so what what could it be could it

---------01:30----------
be that my CPU or my PC H died or could

---------01:33----------
it be that maybe they're not being

---------01:34----------
powered so let's reach over to the

---------01:35----------
microscope here and again this is not

---------01:37----------
something you need a microscope for I

---------01:38----------
just don't feel like with the

---------01:39----------
autofocus on the camera right now so if

---------01:42----------
you look over here what you're gonna see

---------01:43----------
is that there's a big spot of what my

---------01:47----------
the other guy who works here he would

---------01:49----------
call this a Shrek's I don't know

---------01:52----------
where he comes up with this he

---------01:53----------
always has something in the tickets that

---------01:54----------
makes us laugh like no ok so ago a

---------01:56----------
little angry goblin ran around this

---------01:58----------
board on everything and things

---------02:00----------
of that nature but look at this that is

---------02:02----------
what we would call here Shrek now

---------02:04----------
if we look at that exact part of the

---------02:06----------
motherboard again this is I'm not

---------02:09----------
getting into advanced electronics here

---------02:10----------
I'm really not I'm not going to be

---------02:12----------
talking about any

---------02:13----------
we will get into buck converters and all

---------02:15----------
that other crap in diagnosing no image

---------02:17----------
vs. no backlight later right here I'm

---------02:19----------
talking about looking eyes brain Oh

---------02:23----------
brain needed the only part of your brain

---------02:24----------
that's needed here is the part of your

---------02:25----------
brain that decodes what your eyes give

---------02:28----------
you so on that exact portion of the case

---------02:29----------
if you were to fit the board into the

---------02:30----------
case what you see is that this part is

---------02:33----------
what shows up so this is what that

---------02:35----------
section of the board looks like and let

---------02:36----------
me just use this microscopes uh auto

---------02:39----------
color correcting whatever adjusting

---------02:41----------
thingy to make that look as good as

---------02:42----------
possible

---------02:43----------
alright hmm anything here look burned

---------02:46----------
hmm anything here look burned hmm

---------02:50----------
anything here looked like it had a

---------02:52----------
problem hmm any components here look

---------02:55----------
like they were actually red hot burned

---------02:58----------
at one point hmm any components here

---------03:02----------
missing the metal ends to them that

---------03:04----------
allowed them to actually conduct

---------03:05----------
electricity hmm

---------03:08----------
you idiot don't reflow

---------03:11----------
without using your brain like I've been

---------03:13----------
doing this video series again in this

---------03:15----------
video series the last three or four

---------03:16----------
videos I did were do not reflow and

---------03:19----------
I went through it when the sleep signal

---------03:21----------
is missing from your PC hu your mCP all

---------03:23----------
the different things that you should

---------03:24----------
look for before you act like a jackass

---------03:26----------
and reflow something that is perfectly

---------03:28----------
fine let's see what that thing does in

---------03:30----------
the schematic so one of the things I'm

---------03:31----------
going to do here is I want to show you

---------03:32----------
how I know what that pin doesn't what it

---------03:34----------
does unfortunately when I google that

---------03:36----------
particular datasheet for that particular

---------03:37----------
schematic I find nothing because Apple

---------03:39----------
loves to have they're the people who

---------03:41----------
create these chipsets for them hide all

---------03:44----------
the information is humanly possible so

---------03:47----------
let's see if I can find one for a

---------03:48----------
different motherboard that is the same

---------03:49----------
CPU I am VP ton pin so max 175 1-1

---------03:52----------
because it's really important to know

---------03:54----------
what these things actually do and it's

---------03:55----------
very helpful to know what these things

---------03:56----------
actually do and I want you to be able to

---------03:58----------
see for yourself how you can figure this

---------04:00----------
out so the max 17 for 11 controls the

---------04:05----------
CPU v core buck regulator so I can't

---------04:07----------
find what that pin means for the newer

---------04:10----------
for the newer chip for the Mac for that

---------04:13----------
MacBook Air but I can't find it for the

---------04:15----------
regular MacBook Pro of the same year so

---------04:19----------
a lot of the times you're not going to

---------04:20----------
be able to find data sheets for the

---------04:21----------
chips that you want but you may be able

---------04:22----------
to find data sheet for a similar chip

---------04:25----------
so here we're going to go and look for

---------04:27----------
the tun pin tun switching frequency

---------04:30----------
adjustment for input for both regulators

---------04:32----------
an external resistor between the input

---------04:34----------
power source and ton sets the switching

---------04:35----------
period now here's the whole problem here

---------04:38----------
they use that same chipset on many

---------04:39----------
different machines some machines run off

---------04:41----------
of a 16 volt power supply some of these

---------04:43----------
machines are run off of a 12 volt power

---------04:45----------
supply some machines like the MacBook

---------04:46----------
Air run off of an 8 volt power supply

---------04:48----------
Mac's integrated and inner still don't

---------04:51----------
want to have to create all these

---------04:52----------
different versions of these chips for

---------04:54----------
all these different input voltages so

---------04:56----------
what they do is they allow you to vary

---------04:57----------
it all but the chip needs to know what

---------04:59----------
voltage is actually all working off of

---------05:01----------
and that's what the ton pin is for

---------05:02----------
without that to set the switching

---------05:03----------
frequency you will get no switching

---------05:05----------
which means you will get no CPU vcore

---------05:07----------
mm-hmm if I were to measure I wonder if

---------05:09----------
this thing has CPU Veeck or maybe you

---------05:11----------
see measuring if it a CPU Veeck or

---------05:13----------
something I should do before I heat gun

---------05:15----------
it let's see what happens if I plug it

---------05:16----------
in and measure for CPU v core do I get

---------05:19----------
CPU v core or do I get 0 volts okay so I

---------05:22----------
plugged it in and I got my fan spinning

---------05:24----------
now you may want to criticize me and say

---------05:26----------
well I don't have the heatsink on there

---------05:27----------
what about the CPU overheating well um

---------05:30----------
hmm you know that's something I should

---------05:33----------
probably worry about if my CPU had any

---------05:35----------
power so I put the black probe on ground

---------05:37----------
and the red probe on the inductor for

---------05:40----------
CPU v core and I got zero point zero

---------05:42----------
zero zero volts and you decided to heat

---------05:46----------
gun the CPU and the PCH

---------05:50----------
furthermore on because the last two

---------05:52----------
times you asked me about this very

---------05:54----------
 issue I linked you to the three

---------05:56----------
videos that I did on CPU power circuits

---------05:58----------
and you clearly didn't watch them yeah

---------06:02----------
well these weren't like the one or the

---------06:03----------
two of the 3-hour ones these these are

---------06:05----------
 six minute videos that you could

---------06:06----------
have watched to learn how to do this so

---------06:10----------
we're going to do is we're going to

---------06:11----------
replace that resistor with a new one and

---------06:13----------
you'll see that I get CPU v core and

---------06:15----------
you'll see that it turns on and it works

---------06:17----------
very happy and the customer will have

---------06:19----------
back working computer on to their CPU

---------06:21----------
dies because you decided to be a

---------06:23----------
and heat got it

---------06:30----------
turn on the soldering iron turn on the

---------06:33----------
hot air station turn on the this

---------06:44----------
I love this thing there we go

---------06:51----------
nice auto-adjust I'm pretty certain that

---------06:54----------
we don't have a pad left there

---------07:27----------
let's see what we can do

---------07:40----------
as an oxidized right there

---------07:52----------
hmm

---------08:01----------
so that's all we get to clean off the

---------08:04----------
board in that little area alcohol and a

---------08:06----------
q-tip if you twist the q-tip instead of

---------08:10----------
rubbing it back and forth you only

---------08:11----------
fibers on the board and you want to

---------08:13----------
spend the 40 or 50 or whatever

---------08:15----------
ridiculous amount of money it is on

---------08:17----------
those those types of q-tips that don't

---------08:20----------
leave fibers I'm a cheapskate I believe

---------08:24----------
in good tools but I also believe in not

---------08:25----------
wasting money so let's get my flux

---------08:30----------
syringe over here don't laugh at how

---------08:32----------
messed up the tip of the needle

---------08:34----------
whatever it is you want to call it the

---------08:37----------
end of the syringe big take a solder

---------08:42----------
with a nice no clean flux inside of it

---------08:45----------
already just not use the end of it as is

---------08:49----------
because that's kind of nasty

---------09:06----------
that's a stain that was a

---------09:09----------
stain that was a total

---------09:13----------
stain and not worth being used okay so

---------09:16----------
we're going to do next it is just

---------09:23----------
scratch away this little pathway over

---------09:24----------
here so heat up the flux that I put

---------09:27----------
there get that to move away

---------10:05----------
my head is in the way oh what a prick I

---------10:09----------
am

---------10:19----------
zoom out a little

---------10:47----------
okay we're going to get another resistor

---------10:50----------
to put over there

---------11:13----------
unfortunately I ran out in my spool so I

---------11:17----------
have to steal it all for something else

---------11:20----------
great okay I'm going to open a board

---------11:23----------
view for another board that I know has

---------11:25----------
that same resistor and hope that I

---------11:27----------
haven't stolen it off of every board oh

---------11:38----------
okay where

---------11:47----------
and of course it's missing from every

---------11:50----------
board in my collection aha so this is

---------12:11----------
the last one left this is the last one

---------12:15----------
left here that tweezer hand might want

---------12:20----------
to grab the tweezers that actually work

---------12:22----------
you don't have a second chance on this

---------12:24----------
one

---------12:29----------
now I think I'll take my chances

---------12:33----------
I think I'll take my chances

---------12:38----------
anybody here ever hear somebody say that

---------12:40----------
before

---------12:46----------
now this is a off

---------12:49----------
nice try nice try lower the hot

---------12:53----------
air lower lower lower all right I

---------12:56----------
stopped that in in midair get out

---------13:02----------
of here with that you ain't going

---------13:04----------
nowhere

---------13:06----------
you're going to sit your ass down now

---------13:11----------
face mofo okay ready mofo you

---------13:21----------
ready

---------13:41----------
10 the end of the resistor a little bit

---------13:46----------
move it back in a where it's supposed to

---------13:48----------
be this is the holy grail of wire right

---------13:50----------
here CNC TechNet wire part number 6 0 0

---------13:55----------
2 3 4 then it also says under magnet

---------13:58----------
wire MW 3 5 - C this is the holy grail

---------14:06----------
of motherboard repair wire oh I've been

---------14:09----------
waiting so long to figure out what you

---------14:10----------
are I'm not used to using magnet wire I

---------14:16----------
honestly never use this stuff before

---------14:19----------
truthfully I really have no feel for it

---------14:22----------
so not really so I'm pretty clueless as

---------14:25----------
to what I'm doing here what I'm even

---------14:29----------
trying to do here

---------14:46----------
that's a but you know what

---------14:49----------
that's actually exactly what I wanted

---------15:07----------
that was my first use of magnet wire

---------15:09----------
ever I'm sure it will get easier and

---------15:11----------
better as time goes on and I figured out

---------15:13----------
what the I'm doing

---------15:14----------
I don't really have the technique down

---------15:16----------
to use magnet wire very well so yeah it

---------15:21----------
is what I did I just extended that over

---------15:23----------
there a nice happy looking extension do

---------15:36----------
you think it's going to work do you

---------15:38----------
think my CP will be good

---------17:08----------
okay so this LCD cable is so I'm

---------17:14----------
going to have to use another assembly to

---------17:16----------
show you that it is CPU vcore

---------17:38----------
yeah I'm going to replace back light

---------17:40----------
fuse oh well that's easy enough

---------17:44----------
I saw the Apple it's really really

---------17:58----------
tempting to just tell you to trust me

---------17:59----------
that it works but that would make this

---------18:01----------
as lame as every other video on the

---------18:03----------
Internet alrighty

---------18:59----------
fuse actually blue very surprising

---------19:04----------
it never blows on the air

---------19:06----------
the LCD connector is what blows on the

---------19:08----------
air the LCD connector is your fuse on

---------19:13----------
the retin on the air boards

---------19:31----------
you

---------19:43----------
why am i such a damn perfectionist this

---------19:46----------
is such a disease I've talked about why

---------19:49----------
being a perfectionist is but I

---------19:51----------
don't follow my own example very often

---------19:53----------
which is not good okay

---------20:21----------
fine now to find an air assembly okay so

---------20:24----------
much for finding another air assembly I

---------20:25----------
did find another air of the exact same

---------20:28----------
year on the table of here that I'm

---------20:29----------
working on so I'm going to use that just

---------20:31----------
that you don't think there's any funny

---------20:32----------
high jinks going on or me making up

---------20:34----------
and using a different board this is the

---------20:35----------
board with the magnet wire that's me

---------20:38----------
holding it right here no editing

---------20:40----------
funniness

---------20:40----------
I'm going to plug this in and you're

---------20:42----------
going to get to see that it works you

---------20:44----------
get an Apple logo on the screen and that

---------20:48----------
will be that should also make sure that

---------20:58----------
there's no short to ground inside of

---------21:00----------
that LCD connector when the LCD is

---------21:02----------
plugged in that would be smart now

---------21:04----------
wouldn't it and unfortunately there is

---------21:09----------
that makes me sad okay so what I'm going

---------21:12----------
to have to do because is replace the LCD

---------21:15----------
connector all right I was

---------21:21----------
hoping this would be a short video

---------21:36----------
love this Auto adjusting thing it's

---------21:39----------
beautiful piece-of-crap man

---------21:59----------
sometimes you cannot measure a short but

---------22:02----------
then when you put the yellow the LCD

---------22:04----------
screen cable in you'll get a short to

---------22:06----------
ground because something inside the

---------22:08----------
connector is mucking it up

---------23:41----------
oh yeah look at how unprofessional the

---------23:43----------
q-tip is look at all the fibers the

---------23:46----------
q-tip is leaving on the board yeah

---------23:48----------
one of the things about having 10000

---------23:50----------
subscribers that I notice is just

---------23:51----------
everybody everybody knows everything it

---------23:53----------
really that that's what happens is that

---------23:55----------
I suddenly I wake up one day and I

---------23:57----------
realize that everybody knows everything

---------23:59----------
from just you can tell from the comments

---------24:02----------
that I get now on here like I've never

---------24:06----------
done this before

---------24:07----------
but yes you can see we have a pretty

---------24:10----------
clean work surface now take a new LCD

---------24:13----------
connector and put it on there and we

---------24:14----------
should be fine

---------25:28----------
awful I am an awful connector soldering

---------25:39----------
that is just disgusting that is a

---------25:41----------
 joke man oh my god let's put the

---------25:45----------
right tip on for sake put the

---------25:47----------
right tip on the right tip

---------26:03----------
okay I got my nice curvy tip thank you

---------26:09----------
Apple for deciding to put whatever the

---------26:10----------
 that thing is right next to my LCD

---------26:12----------
connector very much so appreciated but

---------26:17----------
the solder travels to the heat so you

---------26:18----------
don't touch the solder over there I

---------26:20----------
sneak under it when the flux is there I

---------26:22----------
press hard against the board I'm making

---------26:24----------
sure that I'm pressing against this so

---------26:26----------
that it's nice on the board and then

---------26:27----------
that's that and this Auto just gets

---------26:33----------
sucked let's solder without an L to piss

---------26:38----------
off the trolls where it's a poster okay

---------26:52----------
so as always I'm going to do this

---------26:55----------
properly and then when I give up on

---------26:56----------
going properly I'm just going to drag it

---------26:58----------
all the way over

---------27:27----------
now one of the things you're going to

---------27:29----------
notice with the iron tips that you use

---------27:31----------
is that the Morse micro the iron tip is

---------27:35----------
the less accurate your soldering

---------27:36----------
temperature is so I'm putting this up to

---------27:40----------
840 now because I know that my iron is

---------27:43----------
very far from the 700 that I have it set

---------27:45----------
to and I know that I'm not at a 40 right

---------27:49----------
now at that tip especially when I'm

---------27:50----------
using it yeah but I got flux on the end

---------28:00----------
like Henry there's not enough space here

---------28:03----------
for me to heat the tip I mean you heat

---------28:05----------
the the pin the pad and the side or at

---------28:08----------
the same time you see that for

---------28:09----------
traditional soldering where you're

---------28:10----------
supposed to like heat the joint and then

---------28:12----------
flow solder and how the hell are you

---------28:13----------
supposed to do that here like really

---------28:14----------
there's no space there's no you

---------28:17----------
can so you have to have the solder

---------28:18----------
already there and then kind of shove it

---------28:19----------
in which means that you know it's not

---------28:21----------
going to make a proper joint because the

---------28:23----------
flux is gonna be already heated away

---------28:25----------
from the solder which is why if you have

---------28:27----------
flux already there you're set so that's

---------28:29----------
why I'm adding flux that's Amtech 559

---------28:33----------
right there it's good stuff the real

---------28:36----------
Amtech 559 is good stuff now some of

---------28:39----------
those are not actually soldering on the

---------28:41----------
top and you may be about to point out

---------28:44----------
that it's not soldering on the top and

---------28:45----------
that's up and I get you but I'm

---------28:48----------
going to be dragging over the entire

---------28:49----------
thing anyway which is why I don't really

---------28:51----------
care oh god that's awful so as I said I

---------28:59----------
do one pin at a time until I make a

---------29:01----------
god-awful mistake and then once I make

---------29:02----------
that often mistake I stop caring and I

---------29:06----------
drag this is what this beautiful bent

---------29:09----------
tip allows me to do I go like this like

---------29:19----------
a kid on a swing

---------29:32----------
and once it starts to get crusty like

---------29:35----------
that add flux in the move

---------30:00----------
gross too much solder

---------30:13----------
when I up I put way too much

---------30:15----------
thought of there I'll just use some wick

---------30:19----------
to get it off

---------30:30----------
okay now we add some flux - there's

---------30:35----------
still excess out of it because the wick

---------30:36----------
didn't go all the way up I'm just going

---------30:37----------
to take that excess solder now I add it

---------30:40----------
back to my pads with the new flux and

---------30:48----------
because I'm a Sikh perfectionist the

---------30:50----------
first pad even though it's nothing I'm

---------30:51----------
going to care

---------30:52----------
it is not cited right because that's

---------30:54----------
just the type of warp - lunatic that I

---------30:56----------
am what see what I mean about tip

---------31:02----------
temperature when I'm touching a pad with

---------31:04----------
a high thermal mass doesn't want to go

---------31:12----------
and at the ends yeah I guess outside of

---------31:16----------
the front pad properly since you're

---------31:26----------
going to troll me if I don't yeah

---------31:58----------
okay let's heat up the flux to make it

---------32:04----------
easier to clean away

---------32:51----------
take two

---------33:23----------
measure for a short to ground before we

---------33:26----------
turn it on

---------34:01----------
tada

---------34:06----------
don't heat gun it alright so this is

---------34:09----------
what you have on the LCD connector when

---------34:12----------
it's done so after all the flux has been

---------34:13----------
cleaned that's 45 X 45 X the table

---------34:18----------
wobbling is really obvious

---------34:27----------
you

---------35:03----------
that's the resistor and that's what we

---------35:07----------
did to get it to the trace we're blue

---------35:10----------
pretty nice right
