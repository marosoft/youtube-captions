---------00:00----------
hi today I want to talk about how to

---------00:01----------
replace the LED driver on a MacBook Pro

---------00:04----------
or a MacBook Air that use a ball grid

---------00:06----------
array LP 8550 chipset to boost the

---------00:10----------
backlight voltage so on older machines

---------00:12----------
they use the qfn package which is a lot

---------00:14----------
less scary to people than this one which

---------00:15----------
uses a BGA package one of the common

---------00:18----------
things that a lot of people ask is how

---------00:20----------
do I replace this how do i reball the

---------00:22----------
chip after I take it off another board

---------00:23----------
so that I can use it on mine and what I

---------00:25----------
have to say to you is that you're asking

---------00:27----------
the wrong question the right question

---------00:29----------
should be how can I spend two dollars

---------00:31----------
and 50 cents to buy this chip with the

---------00:33----------
balls already on it you are asking the

---------00:35----------
wrong question if you're trying to

---------00:37----------
reball the chip then you can buy new

---------00:39----------
three-balled for two dollars and fifty

---------00:41----------
cents either a you are a just a cheap

---------00:44----------
 or be you're simply ignorant as I

---------00:48----------
was at one time and you don't think that

---------00:50----------
you can buy this thing new but I assure

---------00:52----------
you if you go to Mouser calm right now

---------00:55----------
that's Mouse as in little thing that my

---------00:57----------
cat kills when he sees it running across

---------00:58----------
the floor with an R at the end

---------01:01----------
Mouser calm and search for L as in Lewis

---------01:04----------
P as in Peter eight five five zero lp8

---------01:08----------
55 zero you will find this I see it will

---------01:11----------
be about two dollars and fifty cents and

---------01:12----------
it will come with balls already on it so

---------01:15----------
you don't have to care about rebelling

---------01:17----------
the chip am I gonna show you how to

---------01:18----------
reball it no do I know how to reball

---------01:21----------
this chip probably not if I tried would

---------01:24----------
I be able to do it successfully

---------01:25----------
maybe maybe after a few hours or maybe

---------01:28----------
after a few hours I'd fail I don't know

---------01:30----------
because I never took the trying to try

---------01:32----------
because it is worth it to me to spend

---------01:34----------
two dollars and fifty cents to get this

---------01:37----------
thing new with balls when I'm charging

---------01:39----------
hundreds of dollars for service now that

---------01:41----------
we've gotten that out of the way let's

---------01:43----------
go on to the actual soldering of the

---------01:45----------
chip because for some reason a lot of

---------01:48----------
people find this very very hard when it

---------01:50----------
should be very very easy the hard part

---------01:54----------
is not in soldering the chip the hard

---------01:55----------
part isn't figuring out why my soldering

---------01:58----------
station is not on and I should know the

---------02:00----------
answer to that by now

---------02:01----------
I should very much so know the answer to

---------02:03----------
that by now it's because I'm doing a

---------02:06----------
video

---------02:07----------
so now let's wait for that to heat up a

---------02:16----------
little bit so this is a macbook air

---------02:23----------
motherboard it's an a20

---------02:24----------
3437 now this video is mainly gonna be

---------02:27----------
on how to actually do the work I'm not

---------02:29----------
gonna go into the Diagnostics I'm not

---------02:30----------
gonna go into the schematics I'm not

---------02:32----------
gonna go into all that because I've done

---------02:33----------
that before in other videos enough right

---------02:35----------
now I just want to show you that

---------02:36----------
replacing this is possible that you

---------02:38----------
don't have to be a genius that you don't

---------02:39----------
have to have some fancy-schmancy to

---------02:41----------
do it you can just do it with any all

---------02:43----------
hot air rework station and soldering

---------02:45----------
iron and that you don't have to reball

---------02:47----------
it and that it's easy because a big

---------02:49----------
problem with all of this work a big

---------02:51----------
problem with all this stuff is that

---------02:53----------
people make it seem so hard they make it

---------02:55----------
seem like it's so impossible they make

---------02:57----------
it seem like you have to be so cool and

---------02:58----------
so experienced in order to get any of it

---------03:01----------
done

---------03:02----------
and you don't you really don't you just

---------03:05----------
have to have some common sense and you

---------03:07----------
have to have somebody already spent all

---------03:08----------
the time figuring it out show you so

---------03:12----------
that you can do it and once somebody's

---------03:14----------
showing you how to do it it's not that

---------03:16----------
hard anymore so since I don't want to

---------03:18----------
inhale solder smoke and die a terrible

---------03:20----------
death of lung cancer I'm gonna put this

---------03:23----------
nice level hack oh FA 430 fume extractor

---------03:26----------
next to where I'm going to be working

---------03:29----------
okay

---------03:30----------
so I have a hack ofr 801 rework station

---------03:32----------
so the first thing you should know

---------03:34----------
before you ask me what temperature I'm

---------03:36----------
on I'm on six and a half I spent $200

---------03:40----------
less to get the hack or that analog

---------03:42----------
temperature control instead of digital

---------03:44----------
temperature control because the

---------03:46----------
temperature I'm at I don't I don't care

---------03:48----------
I I will get used to where I am on the

---------03:50----------
knob versus an actual number and the

---------03:53----------
number that you use is gonna be

---------03:55----------
different based on the nozzle you use

---------03:56----------
and all this crap anyway so I figured I

---------03:58----------
would save $200 on my tool by buying an

---------04:00----------
analog one so if you want to know what

---------04:02----------
temperature I'm on I'm on six and a half

---------04:05----------
and I'm on about 10 for airflow so with

---------04:09----------
that said let's get on to removing the

---------04:11----------
LED driver now to remove the LED driver

---------04:14----------
take my hot air I'm gonna take my

---------04:18----------
tweezers

---------04:19----------
this broke-ass pair of tweezers and my

---------04:22----------
good pair of tweezers are probably

---------04:24----------
stolen by my coworker which is karma

---------04:27----------
because I always steal things from him

---------04:29----------
and I'm gonna do this so I'm gonna be

---------04:31----------
about however far away that is

---------04:40----------
now the thing I'm gonna do with this

---------04:42----------
chip I'm gonna tap it every now and then

---------04:44----------
to see if it's actually ready to be

---------04:46----------
moved so the first thing is I want to

---------04:47----------
preheat the board a little bit you don't

---------04:49----------
want to just like go in on the chip

---------04:50----------
immediately preheat the board around a

---------04:52----------
little bit to make it easy and then

---------04:57----------
after a while when you see the resulting

---------04:59----------
solder or like see that and see how

---------05:00----------
that's kind of starting to move around a

---------05:02----------
little then you can go in touch the chip

---------05:06----------
not not ready to go yet not ready to go

---------05:10----------
yet still not ready to go now it's ready

---------05:16----------
to go see I moved it in a moved see the

---------05:19----------
thing that moving it does is it tells me

---------05:21----------
that the chip itself is disconnected

---------05:25----------
from the balls because if I just picked

---------05:27----------
this up in any of those balls what this

---------05:30----------
tells me when I poke it and then I see

---------05:32----------
it move is that every single ball is

---------05:35----------
disconnected from every single pad and

---------05:36----------
that they are every single one of those

---------05:38----------
balls is melted if the balls are not

---------05:40----------
melted and stop it I know some of you

---------05:42----------
are laughing right now if the balls

---------05:44----------
don't melt if the balls are dry what

---------05:46----------
they're gonna do is they're gonna rip

---------05:47----------
those pads off of the board and then

---------05:48----------
you're gonna have to run trace wires to

---------05:50----------
the components underneath the chip that

---------05:52----------
is 25 balls

---------05:53----------
that's about one-eighth the size of my

---------05:56----------
pinky fingernail and you don't want to

---------05:58----------
do that so poke the chip a little bit

---------06:00----------
after your digging and poke the chip a

---------06:02----------
little and then once you've poked if you

---------06:04----------
actually see that it moves not just a

---------06:06----------
tiny bit but if the entire thing can

---------06:08----------
move

---------06:08----------
make sure your heat is there keep it

---------06:10----------
there for another two seconds the reason

---------06:12----------
I say keep it there for another two

---------06:13----------
seconds is because if you poke it and

---------06:15----------
then you go to remove it what's gonna

---------06:17----------
happen is when you poke it you probably

---------06:19----------
move the hot air away which is actually

---------06:20----------
allowed it to cool so put it back there

---------06:22----------
again for just another two seconds and

---------06:23----------
then lift it up or even better you could

---------06:25----------
simply keep the hot air there and not

---------06:27----------
move your hands when you poke it don't

---------06:29----------
be like me and move your hand without

---------06:30----------
realizing it when you poke the chip

---------06:32----------
because you can't control your left in

---------06:33----------
your right hand at the same time and

---------06:34----------
just remove it now the cleaning stage

---------06:38----------
what you're gonna want is a flat tip

---------06:40----------
soldering iron for this part of the

---------06:42----------
project so there are different types of

---------06:45----------
tips that you can get I'm gonna show you

---------06:46----------
under the microscope so you can have a

---------06:48----------
conical tip like this which is all the

---------06:50----------
way around

---------06:51----------
same thing and then you could have this

---------06:52----------
flat chisel tip which is perfectly flat

---------06:56----------
at one point we want the flechette

---------06:57----------
though oh my god this iron can be

---------07:00----------
annoying sometimes I want to talk and

---------07:02----------
finish my sentence but no it's you

---------07:06----------
okay so let's wait for this thing to

---------07:09----------
heat up now it's gonna beat but it heats

---------07:12----------
up so it's gonna allow me the latest

---------07:16----------
there perfectly flat in order to clean

---------07:18----------
everything so the first thing I'm gonna

---------07:20----------
do here is add some flux so the flux

---------07:23----------
that I use is Ametek 5:59 it's good

---------07:28----------
stuff have it in one of these nice

---------07:31----------
little syringes now I have the wrong

---------07:32----------
syringe so too much flux is going to

---------07:34----------
come out because I haven't taken the

---------07:35----------
time since moving to fine or I put my

---------07:37----------
syringes so I'm just gonna put some flux

---------07:39----------
here and what I want to do is I want to

---------07:42----------
remove all that old solder all that

---------07:44----------
solder is lead-free solder which is a

---------07:45----------
little bit more difficult to work with

---------07:46----------
and pick up also it's old crusty old

---------07:49----------
solder and I don't want that I want some

---------07:52----------
nice fresh news so I'm doing here trying

---------07:55----------
to do here with one eye piece is add

---------07:59----------
something like so it's a nice let it

---------08:03----------
solder with a good flux add it all

---------08:06----------
around now what I'm gonna do is I'm

---------08:07----------
gonna take some solder awake I like to

---------08:10----------
use goat wick spelled gooo T you can so

---------08:17----------
it's a good stuff I'm not a biggest fan

---------08:19----------
of wick I usually use the desoldering

---------08:21----------
iron the hakko 808 that I have here but

---------08:24----------
I don't feel like plugging it in right

---------08:25----------
now

---------08:25----------
and realistically speaking most of you

---------08:27----------
guys are gonna be more comfortable

---------08:28----------
buying a $5 wick than you are $200 d

---------08:31----------
soldering gun

---------08:32----------
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put

---------08:35----------
the wick on top of here now that I have

---------08:37----------
a flat tip and not a conical one it's

---------08:39----------
going to be much easier to picking up

---------08:41----------
all the junk now what I'm doing is I'm

---------08:43----------
not moving the iron I'm moving the wick

---------08:45----------
back and forth because it helps control

---------08:47----------
the iron and helps me move what I wanted

---------08:49----------
to and one of the other things with wick

---------08:51----------
never put the never take the iron off

---------08:53----------
and then move it because here's the way

---------08:55----------
this works this is really just kind of a

---------08:57----------
bunch of braided wire that's designed

---------08:59----------
and put together in a manner in which it

---------09:01----------
absorbs solder so if I put this on the

---------09:03----------
pads

---------09:04----------
and then I take the iron off and then I

---------09:06----------
move this the pad and the solder and

---------09:08----------
this is going to get dry then it's going

---------09:11----------
to solidify and this is going to be

---------09:12----------
stuck and soldered on to the pad I'm

---------09:14----------
gonna move it and the pads are gonna get

---------09:16----------
ripped off so never ever ever move this

---------09:18----------
 without having the iron firmly

---------09:20----------
pressed on it and without the iron

---------09:22----------
actually being hot that's the second

---------09:24----------
thing so now I'm going to go over this

---------09:26----------
again you just cut off a little bit of

---------09:29----------
wick that I used and we're gonna make

---------09:31----------
sure that we've got a nice flat surface

---------09:32----------
here

---------09:41----------
okay nice flat surface and you don't

---------09:45----------
want to go nuts with this part okay

---------09:47----------
another mistake that some people make

---------09:49----------
who are bad at this and I'm not the best

---------09:51----------
at soldering but I know enough to not

---------09:54----------
destroy things is what they do is they

---------09:56----------
over wicket they get obsessed with

---------09:57----------
cleaning every single little piece and

---------09:59----------
what happens is they actually wear the

---------10:00----------
pads away to the point where they can't

---------10:02----------
solder to them I used to have somebody

---------10:04----------
who did that with graphics with graphics

---------10:07----------
chips you know half of the graphics

---------10:08----------
chips in me that he did wouldn't

---------10:10----------
actually work because he whipped the

---------10:11----------
hell out of it

---------10:12----------
I wonder why is it taking seven or eight

---------10:15----------
hours to do one job and then I saw how

---------10:17----------
much time he spent wicking it and then I

---------10:19----------
started removing some of the graphics

---------10:21----------
chips off of the boards after he was no

---------10:23----------
longer working here and I saw that a lot

---------10:26----------
of those pads were just gone and they

---------10:30----------
were covered in this junk and one of

---------10:32----------
them would say ways I was able to fix it

---------10:33----------
by the way it's a good thing that you

---------10:34----------
should know in case you ever make this

---------10:36----------
mistake because I've made it before too

---------10:37----------
if you see that a pad is almost gone and

---------10:40----------
after you've wiped it down with the

---------10:41----------
alcohol and everything run put the iron

---------10:43----------
on it at a temperature maybe 750 get a

---------10:45----------
good Kester a leaded solder with some

---------10:48----------
good flux inside of it because they make

---------10:50----------
these with flux there's some good flux

---------10:51----------
inside that you can get on all speck and

---------10:53----------
just keep running solder into it move it

---------10:55----------
around like this and you'll notice that

---------10:57----------
what it does is it takes all the crap

---------10:59----------
that was on the paddle the junk and all

---------11:00----------
the garbage and it actually winds up

---------11:02----------
getting us you know stuck inside the the

---------11:04----------
flux and it goes away pretty much flows

---------11:08----------
away into that solder ball so when you

---------11:09----------
flick it away you guys are the wind up

---------11:10----------
flicking away the crab and you have a

---------11:11----------
nice pad and then you can wake it again

---------11:13----------
and you'll see that it's clean but

---------11:14----------
hopefully you don't get to the point of

---------11:16----------
doing that so now we have a nice clean

---------11:18----------
pad so I'm gonna do now is put some flux

---------11:21----------
on here probably too much because I

---------11:23----------
don't have the right little needle and

---------11:24----------
somebody on YouTube is gonna troll me

---------11:26----------
for it and I'm probably gonna tell them

---------11:30----------
to go themselves so we're going to

---------11:34----------
get a LP 8550 now again Mouser comm how

---------11:38----------
do you reball the chip what is the

---------11:40----------
proper way to reball the chip the proper

---------11:42----------
way to reball the chip is to buy it with

---------11:44----------
the balls on it which is two dollars and

---------11:47----------
fifty cents

---------11:50----------
now another important thing here is to

---------11:52----------
remember the orientation of the chip

---------11:53----------
remember the way you took it off of the

---------11:55----------
board because if you put the chip on the

---------11:56----------
wrong way it will not actually light up

---------11:59----------
the screen so you put it on now aligning

---------12:04----------
this is a [ __ ] if you don't have a

---------12:06----------
microscope so the other thing I should

---------12:07----------
have mentioned here buy a microscope

---------12:10----------
this is from Oman oh I got this set up

---------12:14----------
for three or four hundred bucks posted

---------12:17----------
probably 450 or somewhere around there

---------12:19----------
Romano's website I like it I've often

---------12:22----------
talked about the am scope SC 400 I don't

---------12:25----------
like that anymore after using this

---------12:26----------
because the image quality on it is not

---------12:28----------
as good and I like the light that this

---------12:29----------
comes with better it's a whiter light

---------12:30----------
than the am scope lights because the am

---------12:32----------
scope one is like a little you know

---------12:34----------
crappy lamp on that thing because it's

---------12:36----------
cheap and on the higher end ones it's

---------12:38----------
something that's really really blue I

---------12:39----------
don't like that super cold blue so it's

---------12:44----------
totally possible to do this without a

---------12:45----------
microscope but I don't really recommend

---------12:47----------
it so my chip is placed it's not

---------12:50----------
perfectly square but it's close enough

---------12:51----------
you want it to be close enough that it

---------12:53----------
could slide in a place without touching

---------12:54----------
other balls so again see how it's not

---------12:55----------
perfect over there I'm gonna try my best

---------12:59----------
to get it as perfect as possible

---------13:05----------
the thing is it's never gonna be totally

---------13:07----------
perfect so but that doesn't matter it's

---------13:11----------
gonna slide into place and I'll show you

---------13:12----------
now the thing is you don't want to get

---------13:14----------
this too close up on it immediately

---------13:15----------
because it'll fly away and let's see if

---------13:18----------
it flies away from me here it eventually

---------13:20----------
will fly away for you so I'm heating it

---------13:23----------
I'm heating it

---------13:24----------
I want to preheat everything a little

---------13:27----------
bit just so that when I actually go to

---------13:29----------
solder it it sutter's nicely now when I

---------13:35----------
go close and I'll be able to tell once I

---------13:37----------
solder it because it's going to move a

---------13:38----------
little and you'll see

---------13:46----------
okay moved a little five four three two

---------13:50----------
one zero okay so when once I saw it move

---------13:58----------
a little bit in the place and once I

---------14:00----------
started moving my iron in a little

---------14:02----------
circle and I actually saw that the

---------14:03----------
entire chip was moving it wasn't just

---------14:05----------
one move like I blew it away with air

---------14:07----------
but it was moving back and forth like

---------14:09----------
it's sitting on a bed on a waterbed

---------14:11----------
which is pretty much you know bed of a

---------14:13----------
bunch of wet solder balls once I saw

---------14:15----------
that I knew that it was liquidus under

---------14:17----------
the chip liquidus means that I've melted

---------14:18----------
all the balls underneath the chip and

---------14:20----------
that because all those balls are wet

---------14:23----------
that whatever's on top of it will be

---------14:24----------
able to move back and forth once I saw

---------14:27----------
that I said I'm gonna keep it here for a

---------14:28----------
few seconds just to make sure all the

---------14:30----------
balls melt because you could have a

---------14:31----------
couple of balls melted you could have

---------14:33----------
the side ones melted but the middle ones

---------14:35----------
won't be melted so just because you see

---------14:36----------
that you've melted solder does not mean

---------14:38----------
that you're actually done with ball grid

---------14:40----------
array rework because the balls on the

---------14:42----------
side we are going to have are gonna melt

---------14:45----------
sooner than the balls in the middle so

---------14:46----------
once I see that it's moving back and

---------14:47----------
forth I'm not just happy I want to

---------14:49----------
actually see that it's going back and

---------14:50----------
forth a couple of times so that I know

---------14:53----------
that I've melted the center balls but I

---------14:55----------
don't want to keep it hot long enough

---------14:57----------
that I actually burn the chip and if you

---------14:59----------
see chisels on the corners of the chip

---------15:01----------
if you see that is chiseling in any way

---------15:03----------
then it's no good

---------15:05----------
now if you actually chisel the chip

---------15:07----------
because you touch it with the tweezers

---------15:08----------
too hard to you scratch the chip it's

---------15:10----------
okay if you scratch the chip you're okay

---------15:13----------
with tweezers on the outer skip part but

---------15:15----------
if the chip looks like it's it's broken

---------15:18----------
off or chipped solely from heat

---------15:20----------
not from you scratching it but the heat

---------15:22----------
itself has actually destroyed it then

---------15:24----------
you it up a little bit and it's

---------15:26----------
time to move on to the next one which

---------15:28----------
again very very good thing that this

---------15:29----------
chip here cost two dollars and fifty

---------15:31----------
cents so it's no big deal and let me

---------15:35----------
show you what the ball is under it look

---------15:36----------
like a little bit

---------15:38----------
that's those got some alcohol in there

---------15:41----------
so let's just get rid of that so I'm

---------15:42----------
gonna lower the heat on this to

---------15:43----------
something that won't melt solder and put

---------15:44----------
the air up I want to be able to

---------15:46----------
evaporate the alcohol away without

---------15:49----------
actually melting the chip just to make

---------15:55----------
it easier for you to see

---------16:06----------
so as you can see it's a good soldering

---------16:08----------
job the chip itself is still in good

---------16:10----------
condition and as always with these

---------16:17----------
videos I do not do this and then

---------16:19----------
edit it and then put it together with a

---------16:21----------
machine that works later or do this on

---------16:23----------
 that already worked I'm gonna

---------16:25----------
actually put this in a machine and show

---------16:27----------
you that what we did worked because if

---------16:28----------
the stuff that I do doesn't work you

---------16:30----------
should not listen to my advice you

---------16:32----------
should only listen to my advice if the

---------16:34----------
advice that I'm giving you is proven to

---------16:36----------
actually work and actually end in a

---------16:38----------
product that you can charge money for

---------17:07----------
let's just put this into my testbed

---------17:10----------
machine so that I can show you that we

---------17:12----------
have a perfectly working backlight also

---------17:14----------
as to why we replaced the LED driver on

---------17:16----------
this one so there was a short on the

---------17:20----------
backlight output to ground and when I

---------17:24----------
put some voltage there to figure out

---------17:26----------
where it was the lp 8550 got really hot

---------17:29----------
which indicates that the backlight

---------17:31----------
driver the LED driver was shorted to

---------17:33----------
ground so I replaced it now I haven't

---------17:36----------
actually made any other measurements yet

---------17:37----------
so there is a very good chance this

---------17:39----------
doesn't work I'm just hoping that this

---------17:40----------
is going to be an easy one because I

---------17:42----------
want to be able to do a video where

---------17:44----------
instead of troubleshooting everything I

---------17:45----------
just go through the basics of how to

---------17:46----------
solder this particular part but this is

---------17:51----------
a video and as I've explained previously

---------17:52----------
anything that I try to do for a video

---------17:54----------
doesn't work

---------18:06----------
I'm not sure if you can see the blinking

---------18:08----------
question mark or not because I'm looking

---------18:10----------
into a 2 inch screen for a camcorder

---------18:19----------
wait a sec that's what zoom is for I

---------18:22----------
forgot I got a good camcorder now

---------18:32----------
okay so as you can see our job but the

---------18:34----------
LED driver is now done so if you have

---------18:40----------
any questions post in the comments I

---------18:41----------
will try to get back to them at my

---------18:43----------
convenience as usual

---------18:45----------
you can message me you can send comments

---------18:48----------
here but do not call me if I get a phone

---------18:51----------
call saying I saw your LED driver video

---------18:52----------
and I had a question about soldering the

---------18:54----------
ball now no no I'm busy I got working

---------18:56----------
but if you have any questions I am more

---------18:59----------
than happy to get back to them my

---------19:01----------
convenience if you can ask them in the

---------19:04----------
comments section here or in youtube

---------19:05----------
messages so that it's something that I

---------19:07----------
can get back to you know as my schedule

---------19:10----------
allows
