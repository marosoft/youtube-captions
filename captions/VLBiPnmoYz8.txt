---------00:00----------
okay so today I'm gonna go over an eight

---------00:01----------
to zero 30 23 board that is not charging

---------00:04----------
and is not seeing the charger and as

---------00:06----------
usual it is the same old

---------00:08----------
Apple you never learn why do you make

---------00:10----------
the PP 3v4 to underscore g3 hot via

---------00:13----------
that's going to the one wire circuit as

---------00:16----------
small as humanly possible no redundancy

---------00:17----------
you don't get three pins you don't get

---------00:19----------
two pins you get one pin and of course

---------00:22----------
this always blows this never works so

---------00:24----------
let's go over a little bit of what I'm

---------00:25----------
talking about here and what I mean so

---------00:27----------
I've talked about the one wire circuit

---------00:28----------
and the one wire circuit as I've talked

---------00:30----------
about in many of the videos about the

---------00:31----------
one wire circuit is the circuit that

---------00:33----------
allows the charger to work and for

---------00:35----------
charger Vil and for pretty much the

---------00:37----------
charger to communicate with the SMC if

---------00:38----------
the charger cannot communicate with the

---------00:40----------
SMC it won't get a green light it won't

---------00:42----------
turn on the machine and nothing good

---------00:44----------
will happen so you need the PP 3 v 4 PP

---------00:46----------
3 V 4 to underscore g3 hot rail to exist

---------00:48----------
for that to occur and of course on the

---------00:51----------
MacBook Airs the one wire circuit is

---------00:53----------
located on the DC n board it is still

---------00:55----------
powered by the pp 3 V 4 to underscore g3

---------00:57----------
hot rail but and as usual of course you

---------00:59----------
get one very very tiny via carrying that

---------01:02----------
not three not four not two one and what

---------01:05----------
happens in water gets on the machine

---------01:06----------
that one tiny little weak via gets

---------01:08----------
completely destroyed and you don't have

---------01:10----------
a one wire circuit so let's see what

---------01:11----------
that looks like here so what I've done

---------01:12----------
here is I've already taken the liberty

---------01:14----------
of removing the connector and cleaning

---------01:15----------
the board since I know I'm gonna have to

---------01:17----------
replace it so the seventh pin on the

---------01:19----------
left is going to be the one that is of

---------01:20----------
interest to us and you can see that I've

---------01:22----------
already tried to do a little bit of

---------01:23----------
scraping away there I'm learning to do

---------01:31----------
the adjustment the camera will actually

---------01:33----------
adjust itself according to what it sees

---------01:35----------
so I'm starting to do that before every

---------01:36----------
video and it makes it look a lot better

---------01:38----------
so as you can see over here number seven

---------01:41----------
is really really blue so this is where

---------01:45----------
it's coming up right and this is where

---------01:47----------
it's broken so I can either try to run a

---------01:50----------
wire under there which I'm afraid to do

---------01:52----------
because I'm afraid that the connector is

---------01:53----------
not going to sit on the board is flat if

---------01:55----------
I do that I'm not really confident in

---------01:57----------
the thickness of the wire that I have I

---------02:00----------
feel like it's a little too thick and

---------02:01----------
that my connector won't sit flat one of

---------02:04----------
the things that's really really really

---------02:05----------
important when doing this type of work

---------02:06----------
if that's the thing has to be flatten

---------02:09----------
the board not just I mean sitting flat

---------02:10----------
but when you go to solder it you should

---------02:11----------
actually be pressing down when you're

---------02:13----------
doing those stable

---------02:14----------
pads to make sure that each one of those

---------02:15----------
pins is touching the board really really

---------02:17----------
hard

---------02:17----------
if those pins are not touching the board

---------02:19----------
really really hard it's gonna be

---------02:20----------
difficult for you to actually get any

---------02:21----------
any work done because when you're trying

---------02:23----------
to make your solder joints it's not you

---------02:25----------
know there's gonna be so much of a gap

---------02:26----------
between the pin and the board that

---------02:28----------
you're gonna have solder there but it's

---------02:30----------
not gonna flow nicely so what I am gonna

---------02:34----------
do here I've already cleaned that take a

---------02:36----------
little bit of cleaning that I'm gonna

---------02:38----------
put this new connector on most likely

---------02:39----------
gonna be cursing a lot while I'm putting

---------02:40----------
the new connector on because this is

---------02:42----------
miserable miserable and they

---------02:43----------
put this on a miserable miserable part

---------02:45----------
of the board right next to this dcn

---------02:46----------
connector there's a good chance that I

---------02:48----------
may just remove that dcn connector and

---------02:50----------
put a new one on later because I know

---------02:53----------
that I'm gonna knock that off what did

---------02:55----------
you learn in my class sunny my class

---------02:58----------
sorry

---------03:13----------
washed it I washed my hands off had some

---------03:16----------
flux on there so we take this connector

---------03:19----------
that I took off of another board so what

---------03:20----------
I did is I put it in the toaster oven

---------03:21----------
put a board that is completely

---------03:23----------
and will never work again that has the

---------03:25----------
same connector in the toaster oven and I

---------03:28----------
left that board there about five or ten

---------03:31----------
minutes I went to the oven and then I

---------03:34----------
just stick the connector right off

---------03:46----------
so first things first is I'm going to

---------03:50----------
tend not both but just one of those

---------03:52----------
paths I'm a tenant and then I me on the

---------03:57----------
side of this connector on on the side of

---------04:02----------
the one little portion that i-10 let's

---------04:04----------
put the right tip on for this purpose

---------04:06----------
and the right tip for me is the tip

---------04:07----------
that's way too thick because I don't

---------04:09----------
have any other small ones come on eat up

---------04:18----------
eat up eat up eat up 510 550 600 700

---------04:26----------
good enough

---------05:21----------
many doing connectors as a joke this

---------05:26----------
ain't my thing this ain't my thing

---------06:03----------
trying to heat that stabilizing rod

---------06:06----------
enough to get to the pad and melt the

---------06:08----------
solder on the pad but Who am I kidding

---------06:24----------
yeah again Who am I kidding

---------06:31----------
let's try getting more of the iron on

---------06:33----------
that pet

---------06:39----------
yeah he does not transferring on the top

---------06:41----------
of the ride to the bottom of the rock at

---------06:45----------
least not enough to melt that solder

---------07:11----------
that's about as good as that's going to

---------07:13----------
 get

---------07:23----------
now I gotta move that back in the place

---------07:25----------
a little better you're really not going

---------07:27----------
to learn much for me with soldering

---------07:29----------
connectors you're gonna learn how to not

---------07:30----------
solder them because I'm so bad at it

---------07:45----------
gross

---------08:13----------
give myself a little shitstain of a pad

---------08:16----------
there I don't want too much solder I

---------08:17----------
want is the stain of a pet a

---------08:21----------
stain of a saddle blah that's all I'm

---------08:22----------
looking for

---------08:47----------
yeah if you want to say that I suck at

---------08:49----------
this you are correct

---------08:51----------
I suck at this

---------09:08----------
is ain't my thing that's the thing I

---------09:14----------
mean if you see that I suck at this as

---------09:15----------
bad as I do on that I can do it what I

---------09:17----------
want you to be thinking is that man this

---------09:19----------
 idiot can do this then so can i

---------09:21----------
and I'm pushing down on the connector

---------09:23----------
really hard and then I'm gonna heat up

---------09:27----------
that stabilizing rod it's gonna heat the

---------09:28----------
pad at the bottom which is then gonna

---------09:30----------
solder it to the board

---------10:22----------
this should be making you sick

---------10:57----------
and now for the other side

---------11:29----------
you can see there's actually some

---------11:31----------
residual solder on there because this is

---------11:32----------
not a new connector because it's not

---------11:34----------
like I can just go to the connector

---------11:35----------
store and buy this the way I buy I get

---------11:37----------
this connector is by again melting it

---------11:39----------
off with another dead board

---------11:48----------
which is the sad reality of how people

---------11:50----------
who are forced to do this or do this are

---------11:52----------
forced to do it you actually get work

---------11:54----------
done

---------11:57----------
unfortunately I melted a little bit of

---------11:59----------
the inside of it with the iron the

---------12:00----------
latching part that's something you want

---------12:03----------
to avoid doing that's not the right

---------12:05----------
thing to do you don't want to do that to

---------12:06----------
the connector now remember the pin 7 so

---------12:11----------
pin 7 was missing so I got a grab PP 3 v

---------12:14----------
4 2 from the other side we're gonna do

---------12:16----------
that right now so I have to go to the

---------12:18----------
board view that's a schematic for

---------12:20----------
different boards so I have to find

---------12:21----------
everywhere PP 3 v 4 to underscore g3

---------12:24----------
Hadas on the sports but he's a net

---------12:25----------
feature which is where I hit the end key

---------12:26----------
and at the end key and the end key after

---------12:30----------
I put that in is gonna let me type I

---------12:32----------
type in what I'm looking for I look for

---------12:37----------
it on my motherboard okay I found it now

---------12:41----------
I run a wire from the bottom of the

---------12:43----------
board to the top of the board so I'm

---------12:45----------
gonna do is I'm gonna cut up my little

---------12:46----------
battery wire my favorite wire that I

---------12:47----------
always show you that I like to use this

---------12:50----------
is wire that came out of an H Rho of 86

---------12:52----------
battery that was thrown away nothing

---------12:55----------
special nothing expensive

---------13:02----------
and I want you to leave this video

---------13:04----------
soldering connectors better than I do

---------13:13----------
okay wheat in one side of that capacitor

---------13:15----------
get some nice fresh solder on there

---------13:18----------
which would make it easy to solder to I

---------13:20----------
take my jumper wire

---------13:36----------
by the way a lot of people ask so with

---------13:38----------
this course that I'm doing why is it

---------13:40----------
that Jess is part is mandatory and mine

---------13:42----------
is not well I definitely don't want to

---------13:45----------
be the person to be teaching you basic

---------13:46----------
soldering so by the time you get to my

---------13:49----------
course I'm going to expect you to know

---------13:51----------
how to do some basic soldering

---------14:26----------
I keep trip grabbing with the tweezers

---------14:28----------
too hard my hand control is not very

---------14:30----------
good today you can tell when you grab

---------14:33----------
with the tweezers to our because you can

---------14:34----------
kind of see the red come out within the

---------14:36----------
battery wire

---------15:00----------
whoa that was awful I shouldn't really

---------15:12----------
be uploading this if I had half a brain

---------15:16----------
in my head I wouldn't upload videos like

---------15:17----------
this I would upload all the ones that

---------15:20----------
make me look really good at what I do an

---------15:21----------
amazing and smart like a genius you're

---------15:23----------
just better than all of you

---------15:24----------
this magically makes this work like

---------15:26----------
 boss and five seconds or less

---------15:29----------
not the videos ever real that I

---------15:31----------
 up all the time just like you I

---------15:33----------
kind of think that's part of what makes

---------15:35----------
this channel special so I'm not gonna

---------15:38----------
change it okay so now we got to count up

---------15:42----------
seven pins right

---------15:52----------
one two three four five six seven

---------16:59----------
well auntie of the DCN board and cable

---------17:01----------
for the old 13-inch air yeah

---------17:11----------
I'll settle for a cable let's hope that

---------17:13----------
the DCN board is good

---------17:37----------
for the one that you said where the

---------17:39----------
connector looks burned thank you

---------17:46----------
you don't know if it works like most

---------17:49----------
things here I don't know if this works

---------17:51----------
either some so there's an element of

---------18:00----------
adventure to it I have a green light

---------18:11----------
imagine that and it plugged in I wasn't

---------18:14----------
expecting it to plug in with what this

---------18:15----------
connector look like okay let's see if I

---------18:18----------
get a fan spinning

---------19:36----------
ladies and gentlemen I'm done we had no

---------19:42----------
green light before and now we have green

---------19:44----------
light and fan spinning so yeah again

---------19:48----------
it's the same old Apple does not

---------19:49----------
 learn again make the PP 3d for

---------19:52----------
to underscore g3 out via going to the

---------19:54----------
one wire section of the board stronger

---------19:56----------
make it bigger make it wider make it two

---------19:58----------
or three lines instead of one it's not

---------19:59----------
that hard and it would cause a lot less

---------20:01----------
pain and suffering to all the people who

---------20:03----------
spilled stuff on their computers and I

---------20:06----------
know that you make 40 million dollars a

---------20:08----------
year selling Apple care but Apple care

---------20:09----------
doesn't cover this anyway so it's not

---------20:11----------
like you get increased revenue as a

---------20:12----------
result of this just to stop ok so I

---------20:14----------
showed you that the board that I did

---------20:15----------
actually works now what I also want to

---------20:17----------
do is I want to show you under the

---------20:18----------
microscope just a little bit of what

---------20:20----------
that looks like so again I can't say

---------20:22----------
that this is the nicest looking thing in

---------20:23----------
the world by any means

---------20:24----------
it's not a perfect connector job and one

---------20:27----------
of the things that you can see is that I

---------20:28----------
smashed this with a soldering iron

---------20:30----------
so when I was pushing my iron over here

---------20:32----------
I slipped and I touched that my hands

---------20:35----------
slipped very often which is why I hate

---------20:37----------
soldering small connectors and I hate

---------20:39----------
doing small crap so it is what it is so

---------20:42----------
I only have one of these left and at the

---------20:44----------
moment the thing is honestly usually I

---------20:45----------
replace it but this is one of those

---------20:47----------
people where they drop the thing off

---------20:48----------
like an hour ago and they've called

---------20:51----------
about no less than three times within

---------20:53----------
the course of that hour which means that

---------20:56----------
I am there is no way in hell I'm gonna

---------20:57----------
get another dead board in in wafer to

---------21:00----------
get here to replace that connector when

---------21:02----------
you're calling three times an hour so

---------21:04----------
what you get is this which I can

---------21:06----------
honestly live with and I'm fine with a

---------21:07----------
and after its cleaned it looks nicer

---------21:10----------
this is the green stuff this is

---------21:12----------
conformal coating the whole point of

---------21:14----------
conformal coating is to make sure that

---------21:16----------
let's say let's say my tweezers are on

---------21:19----------
ground and I drop it on here this does

---------21:21----------
not conduct electricity this green

---------21:22----------
conformal coating is insulation so that

---------21:24----------
that is not exposed and the other thing

---------21:26----------
that it does you know again if it keeps

---------21:28----------
it from getting damaged so if you're

---------21:29----------
gonna poke at it or something like that

---------21:30----------
if I poke at it I'm not gonna actually

---------21:32----------
be poking at the wire I'm gonna be

---------21:33----------
pointing at the coating which is which

---------21:35----------
is a good thing and the solder joints

---------21:37----------
here again for somebody who sucks at

---------21:38----------
soldering connectors you could do a lot

---------21:39----------
worse it's not perfectly on point

---------21:41----------
each one of those is not like absolutely

---------21:44----------
100% perfectly aligned like yeah it's a

---------21:47----------
little bit aligned down but those are

---------21:49----------
clearly

---------21:49----------
just fine solder joints and there's

---------21:51----------
really nothing for even the biggest of

---------21:54----------
trolls to [ __ ] at their that is pretty

---------21:58----------
much the way it's supposed to look and

---------22:01----------
on the other side of the board you can

---------22:02----------
see my mess of green that is a lot

---------22:07----------
of green

---------22:10----------
so my that is a wire which is why we

---------22:13----------
inspect the before we give it back

---------22:16----------
to people that is an alien hair that is

---------22:27----------
another alien hair

---------22:37----------
and yeah that's that so this board works

---------22:40----------
I'm just gonna let it sit in the oven

---------22:42----------
for a little longer just for the

---------22:43----------
conformal coating to dry and also to get

---------22:44----------
rid of any other junk that may be

---------22:46----------
sitting under the chips so I ultrasonic

---------22:48----------
tit again just to clean it off after I

---------22:50----------
was done with the work and then I put it

---------22:52----------
in the oven for a while and that's that

---------22:58----------
another boy done
