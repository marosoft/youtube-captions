---------00:00----------
now we're going to get to doing some

---------00:01----------
board repair by the way they have a

---------00:03----------
secret did your best buddy send you any

---------00:05----------
more pickles I'm sure there's a three hi

---------00:07----------
hi there any more pickles have you eaten

---------00:08----------
them all it was a great pickle war so

---------00:14----------
here we have a Macbook let's see what's

---------00:19----------
going on with this MacBook we're gonna

---------00:21----------
plug this board in and see what's going

---------00:22----------
on with it this appears to be an 8 - 0 -

---------00:25----------
0 0 8 4 0 board from an a 1708 MacBook

---------00:28----------
five volts 9 volts 20 volts 20 volts

---------00:33----------
however at 20 volts it's only taking 40

---------00:37----------
milliamps hmm well we know that pp 3 V 3

---------00:41----------
underscore g3 huh be present because

---------00:45----------
these two chips that speak to the

---------00:46----------
charger that get it to put out 20 volt

---------00:48----------
instead of 5 are working properly but

---------00:51----------
something else is gonna be wrong because

---------00:53----------
we're only getting 40 milliamps so let's

---------00:55----------
check our main power rails and see

---------00:57----------
what's going on in this MacBook all

---------00:59----------
right so we're gonna do here is we're

---------01:00----------
gonna go through our power lines and see

---------01:02----------
what's present and what's not we have to

---------01:04----------
find the page that has all our power

---------01:05----------
rails

---------01:12----------
there's no space for me to move forward

---------01:14----------
you guys none at all I think I'm gonna

---------01:18----------
have to use the osha-approved ladder

---------01:22----------
what OSHA proof ladder you know the one

---------01:27----------
hanging near the wall that's not a

---------01:28----------
ladder that's a folding chair yeah oh

---------01:30----------
there we go I think that's better so

---------01:33----------
let's take a look through this board and

---------01:35----------
check our main rails the first rails are

---------01:37----------
gonna check our RG three hot rails and

---------01:39----------
see what's present on them we're gonna

---------01:41----------
tell and on Paul Daniels is execrable

---------01:43----------
multimeter software and have it show up

---------01:44----------
on the screen everybody

---------01:46----------
wave hi to our friend Paul Daniels at PL

---------01:48----------
Daniel's calm if you have a machine in

---------01:52----------
Australia that you'd like fixed you can

---------01:54----------
send it to Paul Daniels and he will fix

---------01:56----------
it so the first rail that we're gonna

---------01:58----------
check on our board is our pp bus pp bus

---------02:03----------
13 volts next now if you look over here

---------02:06----------
you'll notice on the schematic that P P

---------02:10----------
DC n is another rail but I don't need to

---------02:12----------
check my DC n because if the DC n wasn't

---------02:14----------
there the rest of this stuff wouldn't be

---------02:15----------
there

---------02:15----------
DC n has to be there in order for me to

---------02:17----------
get any other ramp finally manage to

---------02:18----------
tune in while you're alive from grats on

---------02:20----------
a million good luck with new stone

---------02:21----------
negotiations greetings from Argentina

---------02:23----------
yeah the new store negotiating the

---------02:25----------
negotiations are going on it's just a

---------02:27----------
bit of a pain in the ass because

---------02:29----------
everybody's available at different times

---------02:31----------
like my lawyer is not available when

---------02:32----------
their lawyers not available and their

---------02:34----------
broker and their managing agent it's all

---------02:36----------
kind of a pain in the ass because

---------02:37----------
they're all available at different times

---------02:39----------
so I said I would like to speak to you

---------02:42----------
all before we go to my attorney because

---------02:46----------
every time that we deal with my attorney

---------02:47----------
I'm paying $475 406 405 dollars and

---------02:52----------
that's a bit of a pain in the ass so how

---------02:54----------
about I speak to you all we we work

---------02:57----------
everything out then you draft the lease

---------02:59----------
I try to get rid of as much [ __ ]

---------03:00----------
than the lease as I can before I give it

---------03:02----------
to the attorney and the attorney does

---------03:03----------
the final go through also the attorney

---------03:05----------
is going to be playing bad guy here I'm

---------03:07----------
gonna be playing good guy because you

---------03:08----------
need to have a good guy bad guy kind of

---------03:10----------
dynamic going on because that's what you

---------03:11----------
have when you have clients and broker in

---------03:13----------
my case Allen was the good guy I was the

---------03:15----------
bad guy here you know I'm I'm gonna be

---------03:18----------
I'm gonna play good guy and my lawyer is

---------03:20----------
going to pay play bad guy or in this

---------03:22----------
case bad

---------03:23----------
bad girl or actually bad elderly woman

---------03:26----------
should be sure more more accurate since

---------03:29----------
she has been doing this since Erica

---------03:32----------
started playing to Reba so let's check

---------03:39----------
out the rest of her ales on this machine

---------03:41----------
pp 3 v 3 PP 5 es 5 what do you have a PP

---------03:44----------
5 es 5 55 es 5 is right here vessel of

---------03:48----------
the Gods imagine how good greenies would

---------03:50----------
taste from the magical vessel glad to

---------03:51----------
see you having so much fun hanging out

---------03:53----------
with us thank you very much alike you

---------03:54----------
know what maybe I will get one of those

---------03:56----------
mugs from Eli the computer guy store for

---------03:58----------
Oreo so Eli's making an FF line yes is

---------04:04----------
he doing an F Paul Daniels no no maybe I

---------04:07----------
should make an F fall dead it's not an

---------04:11----------
insult it's a way of life so let's see

---------04:15----------
what do we have for PP 5 es 5 we have

---------04:21----------
nothing hmm interesting what else

---------04:25----------
because now we're missing a rail that

---------04:27----------
comes from our 5 volt and 3 volt

---------04:29----------
regulator so I'm kind of curious what

---------04:30----------
else comes out of this chip so P B 3 B 3

---------04:34----------
S 5 also comes out of that ship and

---------04:36----------
let's see what P P 3 P 3 s 5 s so we do

---------04:40----------
this p p f-- oh no that's that's not

---------04:44----------
original solder oh no no no you want to

---------04:51----------
switch go not really why not cuz that

---------04:54----------
would just throw away the board you mean

---------04:56----------
you would just throw away because it's

---------04:58----------
an Apple product you would have throw it

---------04:59----------
away because it's Apple oh let's do the

---------05:01----------
same thing to your members clearly it's

---------05:06----------
an Apple product it gets thrown away

---------05:11----------
you're learning what to do with Apple

---------05:13----------
products no I meant like I would not

---------05:15----------
want to work on this board so I would

---------05:17----------
throw it away but you could work on it

---------05:18----------
that's your calling in light calling in

---------05:20----------
life

---------05:28----------
boards fixing broken you know throw away

---------05:33----------
your distraught

---------05:36----------
can we do what techrax does to your

---------05:38----------
laptop can we send your laptop to tech

---------05:39----------
Rex can you say yes or no before you

---------05:43----------
check out his channel hi hi what is

---------05:47----------
techrax do okay okay it doesn't sound

---------05:54----------
good it sounds like Cleo would be put in

---------05:56----------
harm's way they make it great again they

---------06:06----------
upped it they up Greggy yeah all right

---------06:08----------
so let's see what's going on here

---------06:09----------
because both of the rails that are

---------06:10----------
supposed to be present from this trip

---------06:12----------
are missing give me five es 5 and P P 3

---------06:13----------
P 3 s 5 do we have a short on P P 5vs5

---------06:15----------
we do not to million ohms do we have a

---------06:18----------
short on P P 3 B 3 s 5 101 ohm okay now

---------06:25----------
what is on P P 3 P 3 is 5 let's take a

---------06:27----------
look B P 3 P 3 s 5 goes to some

---------06:34----------
capacitors it goes to our PMI C and it

---------06:39----------
goes to the CPU now do you think that

---------06:42----------
what's shorted here is going to be a

---------06:44----------
capacitor or do you think what shorted

---------06:46----------
here is gonna be the CPU can I can I ask

---------06:49----------
a friend what do you think it's gonna be

---------06:51----------
one second ah it's it's the sitter's I

---------06:57----------
know how to get some good luck considers

---------07:00----------
the thing that sounds like it's a mom's

---------07:01----------
usually when Paul has this type of

---------07:03----------
problem his short is in the CPU however

---------07:07----------
if I drink from this month I don't want

---------07:10----------
high blood pressure it'll be a capacitor

---------07:14----------
better check your blood pressure there's

---------07:16----------
a lot of salt in there let's you I

---------07:20----------
blessed it I'm assuming the Eli

---------07:23----------
merchandise get rid of the MacBook yeah

---------07:30----------
keep the book

---------07:33----------
[Laughter]

---------07:39----------
I'll buy a cup that has some loss factor

---------07:41----------
like New York City commercial real

---------07:43----------
estate look at that CPU burn I just keep

---------07:48----------
putting voltage through the CPU can you

---------07:50----------
scroll down over there well look at that

---------07:52----------
114 Celsius go let's leave this for Paul

---------08:08----------
piece of [ __ ] here we have an a 1990

---------08:11----------
MacBook that's not working let's open

---------08:13----------
this up and figure out why it's not

---------08:15----------
powering on why is there a knife on my

---------08:18----------
desk

---------08:32----------
what was the point of that you just

---------08:33----------
stuff it anything Paul has a secret

---------08:35----------
stash

---------09:04----------
oh goodness

---------09:11----------
his new his new employee is cringing hey

---------09:14----------
why do I have oh he's not even using a

---------09:21----------
nerf gun how it's just throwing it he's

---------09:24----------
just throwing it oh there I could get

---------09:30----------
the other gun huh get me the other gun

---------09:32----------
another gun I don't think he has a

---------09:38----------
license for that running out of bullets

---------09:41----------
soon Eric could get me the Branson era I

---------09:47----------
could pick up the bullets go pick out

---------09:49----------
the bullets but I look like a tracking

---------09:51----------
dog for you you look like a Mac user Oh

---------09:56----------
oh my gosh I don't understand why none

---------09:58----------
of your other girlfriend showed up on

---------09:59----------
stream it's me and abundantly clear to

---------10:04----------
me now I'm not really the you know

---------10:05----------
biggest shield to use either come on out

---------10:07----------
hi

---------10:27----------
I know except you know I'm you being

---------10:30----------
used as the shield I don't know why if

---------10:34----------
you're gonna be if you don't want to be

---------10:36----------
useful actively you'll be use of

---------10:37----------
passively passively oh look at this he's

---------10:40----------
bravely going out into the battle

---------10:42----------
territory by himself whoa

---------10:45----------
Erica I need you to take the box cutter

---------10:46----------
and cut off in that lithium battery

---------10:48----------
that's right Vic the high highs like do

---------10:50----------
you see the lithium ebike battery you

---------10:52----------
ready I'm going to give you something

---------10:55----------
sharp and you're going to slash the

---------10:56----------
battery go Erica slash the battery so

---------10:59----------
first thing we do with this MacBook like

---------11:01----------
with any MacBook is we have a nerf war

---------11:03----------
before we start and then once we start

---------11:05----------
we unplug the battery and see how much

---------11:07----------
power the board takes by itself [ __ ] I

---------11:10----------
have a date with Cindy have a date let

---------11:12----------
me read this let me dismiss it don't

---------11:18----------
dismiss Cindy I'm gonna block that hole

---------11:22----------
alright so we're at 5 volts 20 milliamps

---------11:26----------
not going any higher than that so we're

---------11:28----------
not we're probably missing PPE 3 B 3

---------11:31----------
underscore g3 hot whatever they call it

---------11:33----------
on Nate to zero there's zero one zero

---------11:34----------
four one

---------11:35----------
so let's take this board out of the case

---------11:38----------
and get started do that Ric D 3215 same

---------11:42----------
as before

---------11:42----------
remember these all have to be good

---------11:44----------
working ships or else nothing's gonna

---------11:45----------
work on the board so PP 3 v 3 underscore

---------11:48----------
g3 hot underscore TC underscore X needs

---------11:50----------
to be present and I can find that right

---------11:53----------
next to the chip let's see if that is

---------11:56----------
present yep zero alright so now we have

---------11:58----------
to figure out where that comes from

---------11:59----------
so this chip over here which is going to

---------12:00----------
allow the charger to speak to the

---------12:02----------
Machine and this trip is gonna request

---------12:04----------
20 volts in the charger it needs the

---------12:06----------
voltage in on VN 3 V 3 which is pp 3 V 3

---------12:09----------
DG 3 hard RTC X where does that come

---------12:12----------
from excellent question

---------12:14----------
let's find out where it comes from on

---------12:15----------
this newer board so we can figure out

---------12:18----------
why it's not present here we go looks

---------12:21----------
like that rail is gonna come from this

---------12:25----------
generic PM I see you looking thing use

---------12:28----------
6960 you 6960 is a BGA chip on this side

---------12:32----------
of the board now we can't blame the BGA

---------12:34----------
chip if it's not being told to turn on

---------12:35----------
so let's take a look and see

---------12:37----------
being told to turn on but you have an

---------12:38----------
enable pin over here see the enable pin

---------12:40----------
look at that CEN let's see what we're

---------12:43----------
getting on our 69 68 which is right on

---------12:45----------
the enable pin did the enable signal go

---------12:48----------
away huh no you don't it's worse than

---------12:51----------
Apple interesting the enable just went

---------12:56----------
away

---------13:03----------
okay let's figure out what that enable

---------13:04----------
comes from because whatever that innate

---------13:07----------
because it's not the pp 3v3 that's going

---------13:09----------
away it's the enable signal for it so a

---------13:11----------
charger enm VR comes from you 7,000 u

---------13:15----------
7,000 is the ISL 9 - 4 0 chip that I

---------13:20----------
can't get yay

---------13:22----------
ISL nine to four zero so in a recent

---------13:25----------
Italian reason there's like six month

---------13:27----------
old video I asked about where to get

---------13:28----------
this chip from and every single one of

---------13:30----------
you reached out to me with this website

---------13:31----------
called IC part calm IC part comm does

---------13:35----------
not have an aunt a Cart button there's

---------13:37----------
no way for me to comment to read that

---------13:39----------
website because it's not in the link in

---------13:41----------
link English or anything it's the it has

---------13:44----------
a bunch of little symbol things that I

---------13:45----------
don't understand where can I get an ISO

---------13:49----------
nine two four zero does anybody there

---------13:53----------
have have a source for an ISO nine two

---------13:56----------
four zero

---------13:57----------
I'd like an is all nine two four zero

---------13:59----------
please I have an ISO 93 nine my own have

---------14:06----------
an ISO nine two four zero

---------14:08----------
I would like an iso 9241 a source that

---------14:11----------
actually has it if anybody has a lead on

---------14:15----------
that that would be lovely

---------14:17----------
there was someone that suggested I get

---------14:19----------
these chargers the iPhone XR external

---------14:23----------
battery or something because it hasn't

---------14:25----------
but then I'm gonna be spending fifty to

---------14:27----------
ninety bucks

---------14:27----------
to have to take a chip off reball and

---------14:31----------
find a stencil that that's not really

---------14:32----------
economically viable then the first

---------14:34----------
result i find on google for iso 9241

---------14:38----------
Benet tur this is like the high IQ

---------14:40----------
version of reddit internal documents

---------14:42----------
show kate apple is capable of right to

---------14:43----------
repair no do you have a source for an is

---------14:47----------
all night there's certainly kept it

---------14:50----------
instead they're purposely making it

---------14:51----------
impossible to get board components so

---------14:53----------
that a single chip to view comes in a

---------14:54----------
$2.00 paperweight god damnit the first

---------14:56----------
result on Google for the chip that I

---------14:58----------
want is me complaining that the chips

---------14:59----------
not available

---------15:00----------
ISL chips dip my own website Google is

---------15:03----------
trolling to shadow me at Google

---------15:05----------
Translate let's translate I see part

---------15:07----------
comm this website is a [ __ ]

---------15:14----------
nobodyís email here is gonna understand

---------15:16----------
a word I say this looks like some yeah

---------15:25----------
this website looks like a mess

---------15:27----------
okay so Penn won t be a gate and one

---------15:31----------
charger gate close enough pen to VDD a

---------15:35----------
then to VGA pin 3 battery and three

---------15:40----------
battery 10 for TB a pin for cxeh oh yeah

---------15:45----------
current sensing current sensing pin 5

---------15:48----------
battery pin 5 battery alright pin 6

---------15:52----------
charger LX to pin 6 TBI ELYX so they're

---------15:55----------
just calling a thunderbolt instead of

---------15:56----------
charger no big deal in 7 ground at 7

---------15:59----------
ground and 8 be gate a be gay to 9 see

---------16:03----------
check current sensing current sensing

---------16:05----------
pin 10 DC in DC n pin 11

---------16:16----------
tbh a boot t be a boot charger boot same

---------17:04----------
boot and enable 26 charger boot and PP 3

---------17:09----------
V 3 enable same [ __ ] 28 not connected

---------17:12----------
[ __ ] 28 wait a second SMC BCA see okay

---------17:18----------
is not used anymore

---------17:19----------
sm c bc AC ok is what's used when to get

---------17:22----------
a green light in the charger but their

---------17:23----------
that doesn't count

---------17:24----------
there's no SMC anymore [ __ ] there is

---------17:27----------
wait maybe there's not maybe it's not

---------17:29----------
connected he in this board because

---------17:30----------
there's no SMC so maybe that doesn't

---------17:32----------
matter anymore let's see does that

---------17:34----------
matter anymore or is SMC bc AC ok a

---------17:37----------
signal that gets shot out is it not used

---------17:39----------
in programming does it is it gonna care

---------17:41----------
okay so that's not used here because

---------17:43----------
there's no SMC but maybe that won't

---------17:45----------
matter [ __ ] it we'll try it i just the

---------17:49----------
main thing I'm worried about is it

---------17:51----------
blowing other stuff on the board ops we

---------17:53----------
just got to make sure there's nothing

---------17:53----------
like that in 30 PP 1 v8 1030 pp 3 V 3

---------17:57----------
okay so that's gonna blow [ __ ] up so

---------18:00----------
over here this pin 30 on the is all 9 to

---------18:03----------
4 0 is powered by 1.8 volts whereas on

---------18:06----------
the old board it's powered by 3.3 volts

---------18:09----------
so these chips are not going to be pin 4

---------18:10----------
pin compatible most of the shit's the

---------18:11----------
same but that doesn't emit that's not

---------18:14----------
gonna work

---------18:17----------
ah

---------18:23----------
forefinger reset forefinger reset over

---------18:28----------
here we have four finger reset in you

---------18:33----------
want your forefinger reset Tim Cook Oh

---------18:36----------
for that that's four finger reset so we

---------18:43----------
got C 1.8 volts in a 3.3 volt chip

---------18:50----------
should be okay

---------18:50----------
really actually yeah you're right

---------18:53----------
because it's expected I'm not putting

---------18:55----------
3.3 into a 1.8 I'm putting 1.8 into a

---------18:58----------
chip that would expect 3.3 so it's the

---------19:00----------
opposite it's not gonna kill anything so

---------19:02----------
35 smc I squared C data line Thunderbolt

---------19:08----------
a gate hi hi get me an ISO nine to 39

---------19:11----------
we're gonna try something crazy stoick

---------19:15----------
Rossmann group.com free shipping within

---------19:18----------
the continental United States for all

---------19:20----------
orders over $30 okay we have an ISO nine

---------19:23----------
two three nine we're gonna do something

---------19:24----------
brave today we're gonna see if an ISO

---------19:26----------
nine two three nine will work in place

---------19:27----------
of an ISO nine two four zero we've

---------19:29----------
checked the pin out the only thing

---------19:30----------
that's different is that this the ISO

---------19:33----------
nine 239 may be programmed to care about

---------19:35----------
smc bc AC okay being present if it's not

---------19:37----------
pulled up it may not allow the enables

---------19:39----------
to go through but this may be an issue

---------19:41----------
of programming I believe that the

---------19:43----------
difference between the ISO nine 239 and

---------19:44----------
ISO 9404 you could program it over SM

---------19:49----------
bus although again when it comes to just

---------19:51----------
having two reball this chip in order to

---------19:52----------
program it that is something that is not

---------19:54----------
gonna be worth the [ __ ] time so let's

---------19:58----------
get this going

---------19:59----------
you think this will work David do you

---------20:01----------
think it's gonna let out smoke

---------20:06----------
I know if you can't do ISL six two five

---------20:09----------
eight versus ISL 65:9 that's down

---------20:17----------
we are gonna hit it and then hit it

---------20:19----------
again

---------20:28----------
seems like you're going over that aerial

---------20:30----------
quite a bit also this one is turned

---------20:34----------
upside down on the other board what do

---------20:43----------
you guys notice that on the on the upper

---------20:45----------
corner what what do you see on the upper

---------20:49----------
right corner there

---------20:53----------
this chip may simply need read balling

---------20:58----------
those to solder look at that they're

---------21:01----------
attached Erica what do you see in the

---------21:03----------
upper right corner uh what do I see you

---------21:08----------
know for anything you mean the two black

---------21:10----------
ones the balls are touching they're

---------21:12----------
touching yes touching you should appear

---------21:16----------
the ball should not be touching one

---------21:18----------
another gotta separate them both

---------21:22----------
separate the balls

---------21:33----------
why is my iron sleeping I don't know a

---------21:37----------
750 - 750 instead of 840

---------22:02----------
Erica if you find me an iso 9241 no i

---------22:06----------
need you to find me an iso 9241 what do

---------22:10----------
you say where's it located both sides

---------22:14----------
and some China I think you're better off

---------22:18----------
getting Cindy to do that work for you

---------22:26----------
Erik is not making a good argument here

---------22:29----------
no I'm saying go to Cindy Cindy's in

---------22:31----------
China she hits you up late at night I'm

---------22:37----------
sure you can ask her for a favor too if

---------22:39----------
Erica can find me this chip I'll give

---------22:41----------
her a favor too

---------22:52----------
Cindy is a woman who who messages him

---------22:55----------
and escapes him late at night

---------23:03----------
Cindy is my waifu

---------23:19----------
Cindy is my waifu of Apple parts and

---------23:24----------
Apple parts

---------23:38----------
I feel like I'm exploring uncharted

---------23:40----------
territory here I'm going where no man

---------23:43----------
has gone before

---------23:44----------
wow you're feeling just fear sailing in

---------23:52----------
the flux like a big raft when entering

---------23:57----------
uncharted territory you should always

---------23:58----------
have lots of gooey material gooey whoa

---------24:04----------
Oh easy there well a little too sticky

---------24:07----------
it got excited you got excited flipped

---------24:10----------
that turned on it looks like

---------24:19----------
it's like swimming in flux or something

---------24:49----------
rapid gold technology you mean like hold

---------24:52----------
music when for when people moon you want

---------24:54----------
some jazzy hold music I need an ISO

---------24:58----------
94099 239 isn't gonna cut it

---------25:04----------
I imagine there's some sort of

---------25:05----------
programming and it's confused and it has

---------25:07----------
no idea what to do wait a second though

---------25:09----------
the programming here would allow it to

---------25:11----------
speak to the SMC right but that's gonna

---------25:15----------
happen on a data line that I imagine is

---------25:17----------
powered by the rail that is missing

---------25:18----------
let's see yeah X this

---------25:28----------
okay our data line is over here

---------25:42----------
this data line is pulled up by one pp

---------25:45----------
1v8 sleep s2r

---------25:56----------
so this probably has to be present

---------25:58----------
before anything else is actually what

---------26:00----------
makes you turning clocks the resole

---------26:03----------
center in the clock today see you Raven

---------26:06----------
clocks yeah what is it like daylight

---------26:09----------
savings or something I have no idea I

---------26:11----------
don't have that in Hawaii so I don't

---------26:13----------
know either

---------26:14----------
I used to have to adjust that on my VCR

---------26:16----------
really David are you old enough to have

---------26:19----------
to change the daylight savings time

---------26:21----------
clock on your VCR I'm a fun way I'm

---------26:26----------
pretty sure your oven clock doesn't have

---------26:28----------
daylight savings on it Erica is old

---------26:31----------
enough to remember having to change the

---------26:33----------
clock on the VCR yeah what

---------26:37----------
Erica's my cool girl cougar oh my gosh

---------26:41----------
you see that with the smile whoo what a

---------26:44----------
cougar mmm what and I always had to go

---------26:51----------
ahead and change my clock on the beasts

---------26:53----------
here because you know sometimes I mom

---------26:54----------
power would go out every once in a blue

---------26:57----------
moon you 7,800 the p.m. I see you're

---------27:05----------
getting people you would be too whatever

---------27:07----------
the hell so we're not getting this

---------27:09----------
either interesting so I don't think the

---------27:13----------
data line with the SMC chip is gonna

---------27:15----------
matter given that it's not gonna be on

---------27:17----------
because we don't have pp1 v8 yeah now

---------27:19----------
the question I have is what is sleep

---------27:22----------
what's s2r is a state because I know

---------27:24----------
what a g3 hot state is and has 5 and s4

---------27:27----------
and s3 and so on and so forth well I

---------27:29----------
don't even know if this rail is supposed

---------27:30----------
to be here it's not here yet but it's an

---------27:33----------
s2 our rail what is it s2 are yeah it's

---------27:39----------
day to you I'm sad why because this is a

---------27:44----------
very easily fixable board if I had one

---------27:46----------
chip that makes me sad you don't have

---------27:49----------
one chip I need my is all 9404 it six

---------27:55----------
months

---------27:56----------
seven eight months probably and no one's

---------27:58----------
helped you with all your pleas growing

---------27:59----------
all they do is send me to a website with

---------28:01----------
a bunch of email addresses that go

---------28:03----------
nowhere and each one of them emails me I

---------28:06----------
see part calm thinking of the first

---------28:08----------
person to email it to me at this point

---------28:09----------
I'm gonna put this in the slots and I'm

---------28:11----------
gonna go to get something to eat on the

---------28:13----------
Saturday night maybe drink my sorrows

---------28:16----------

---------28:18----------
four zeros in spite of a million

---------28:20----------
subscribers on YouTube

---------28:21----------
I still can't buy a basic chip that I

---------28:23----------
need to do my job so that my customer is

---------28:25----------
not stuck with a two thousand dollar

---------28:27----------
paperweight and so they can get their

---------28:29----------
data all because the people at Apple are

---------28:32----------
complete and utter dicks if you work for

---------28:35----------
inter so if you have a source for an iso

---------28:37----------
9241 a lewis of Rossman group comm

---------28:43----------
that's Lewis at Rosman group comm don't

---------28:45----------
delay help me get an iso 9241 a i'm not

---------28:49----------
trying to sell you audible i'm not

---------28:50----------
trying to sell you [ __ ] you don't need

---------28:52----------
I'm not trying to shill Nord [ __ ] VPN

---------28:54----------
so that you you know all your personal

---------28:55----------
data can be available everywhere after

---------28:57----------
some sort of man in the middle of attack

---------28:59----------
because they can't administer their

---------29:00----------
service properly all I want to do as an

---------29:02----------
influencer or the only thing I care

---------29:04----------
about is all nine to four zero get me an

---------29:06----------
ISO nine two four zero or I will start

---------29:09----------
subjecting you to audible and Nord VPN

---------29:11----------
ads that is not a threat that is a

---------29:13----------
promise apparently what I've been told

---------29:16----------
by the hipsters now you can never trust

---------29:18----------
a hipster you can never truly trust a

---------29:20----------
hipster what I've been told by hipsters

---------29:23----------
and in this modern world the taste of

---------29:28----------
whatever it is that you're consuming

---------29:30----------
it's as important to deliver that taste

---------29:34----------
out of a beautiful emotionally

---------29:39----------
significant piece of like dishware to

---------29:42----------
give you the the best taste and the best

---------29:45----------
flavor so uh so I got my new I got my

---------29:48----------
new mug in I got my new maybe new mug in

---------29:50----------
high-quality high-quality straight from

---------29:53----------
Bangladesh trying out a new cup of

---------29:56----------
coffee at try dig up the coffee I don't

---------29:58----------

---------30:17----------

---------30:18----------
difference between a normal Hmong and

---------30:21----------
this quality mug we'll see my god it's

---------30:35----------
true it's true the hipsters are right

---------30:39----------
about one thing one and only one thing

---------30:43----------
but they are right ah

---------30:46----------
oh the container you consume a liquid

---------30:53----------
out of it's like it's as important mmm

little bit biased but I do have to say I

---------31:24----------
had to say coffee tastes better and an

---------31:27----------
f-minus mug I really the the emotional

---------31:31----------
connection you have with the f- mug that

---------31:34----------
the the symbiosis between you with the

---------31:37----------
mug and the coffee inside mm-hmm I think

---------31:44----------

tastes sweeter than coffee at a real

---------31:50----------
genuine genuine not so limited edition
