---------00:00----------
so the board is out of the case of this

---------00:01----------
MacBook in the issue that we were having

---------00:02----------
is that we were only getting five volts

---------00:06----------
not 20 volts in the charger which is

---------00:07----------
gonna mean that one of these CD 3215

---------00:10----------
chips is broken and not allowing

---------00:11----------
communication with the charger or the

---------00:13----------
chipset over here that makes PP 3 V 3

---------00:15----------
underscore g3 hot PB 3 V 3 underscore g3

---------00:18----------
hot is what allows the CD 3215 to turn

---------00:21----------
on that power supply could be missing so

---------00:24----------
typically it's one of those two things

---------00:26----------
almost every time and we're gonna try

---------00:29----------
and figure out which it is now I also

---------00:30----------
want to say I don't know who it is that

---------00:32----------
got me this warm microscope LED but I

---------00:34----------
want to say thank you very much do

---------00:36----------
whoever got this from me this is

---------00:37----------
actually a warm set of LEDs for the

---------00:40----------
microscope that does so that when I look

---------00:42----------
in the microscope it's not as fatiguing

---------00:44----------
as it used to be yeah it's a bit more

---------00:46----------
warm than I'd want it to be but it is

---------00:48----------
actually very nice as you can see it's

---------00:51----------
decreasing the red and increasing the

---------00:53----------
blue quite a bit in my camera's Auto

---------00:55----------
calibration software so to you guys it's

---------00:58----------
going to look the same because my my

---------01:01----------
microscope camera is the we are

---------01:03----------
going to take a look at this area and

---------01:04----------
see if we get PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hod

---------01:08----------
now the first thing we need to do in

---------01:10----------
order to check if this works is we check

---------01:13----------
and see if P P 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot

---------01:18----------
is there do we have P P 3 V 3 underscore

---------01:22----------
g3 hot on the coil where do we not have

---------01:24----------
PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot in the coil

---------01:29----------
it looks like we have 0 volts 4 PP 3 V 3

---------01:33----------
underscore g3 hot on the coil why is

---------01:36----------
that why do we have no PP 3 V 3

---------01:39----------
underscore g3 hot on the coil let's take

---------01:41----------
a look at the PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot

---------01:43----------
circuit the first thing we're gonna do

---------01:46----------
is point out why it's important to get

---------01:49----------
that we have PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot

---------01:51----------
in order for the charger to turn on and

---------01:53----------
work if we take a look at the CD 32:15

---------01:57----------
chip this is a chip that's going to talk

---------01:59----------
to the charger so if we take a look

---------02:01----------
you'll see that we have some derp data

---------02:03----------
lines over here and the let's take a

---------02:07----------
look at these beautiful data lines now

---------02:10----------
these data lines this little C we're

---------02:12----------
over here it says bi-directional

---------02:13----------
bi bi this stands for bi-directional

---------02:16----------
data line and this is going to go

---------02:19----------
between the charge port which is over

---------02:21----------
here and the CD 32:15 chip which is over

---------02:24----------
here this chip is going to talk to the

---------02:26----------
charger and say hey charger I'm not a

---------02:28----------
cellphone I don't need five volts I need

---------02:30----------
20 volts I'm a MacBook I'm special give

---------02:34----------
me 20 volts because I'm a MacBook but in

---------02:37----------
order for this trip to turn on it needs

---------02:39----------
its input voltage and its input voltage

---------02:41----------
is pp 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot see that

---------02:44----------
that goes right over here 2 V in V in

---------02:48----------
that's not VIN like a VIN number like

---------02:51----------
what you use to tell what parts are

---------02:53----------
stolen on cars that's a voltage in

---------02:54----------
typically what you see in the top of the

---------02:56----------
chip is gonna be voltage in so we need

---------02:58----------
PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 ha and the

---------03:01----------
circuit that's going to create that

---------03:02----------
power rail of pp 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot

---------03:07----------
is gonna be right over here PP so let's

---------03:12----------
check our pp 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot

---------03:15----------
circuit and if you figured it out by now

---------03:18----------
yes I'm looking for an excuse to

---------03:20----------
continuously say PP PP bus

---------03:24----------
pp 3 before 2 PP 3 v3 underscore PPP PPP

---------03:29----------
PPP I love talking about my PP on

---------03:32----------
livestream it's one of my favorite

---------03:34----------
things to do is talk about my PP on

---------03:36----------
livestream

---------03:37----------
I feel like louis c.k now we're gonna do

---------03:42----------
over here we check the output we checked

---------03:46----------
the output right here and we had 0 volts

---------03:49----------
instead of 3.3 volts so this is the chip

---------03:52----------
that's going to take our voltage from

---------03:53----------
the charger and turn it into 3.3 volts

---------03:56----------
so the first thing we want to do is see

---------03:58----------
what's present on the input so the way

---------04:01----------
this chip is made it says from USBC

---------04:04----------
source and PP bus g3 hot and then you

---------04:06----------
have a diode so that means that you have

---------04:08----------
two different voltage sources so this

---------04:10----------
could be powered either from the battery

---------04:12----------
PP bus g3 hot which is battery voltage

---------04:15----------
or if your battery's dead it can be

---------04:17----------
powered from the charger this diode is

---------04:19----------
present over here on input to make sure

---------04:21----------
if the voltage from the charger does not

---------04:23----------
go into the battery or vice versa if we

---------04:26----------
look over here you'll see

---------04:27----------
that it says sup now typically you would

---------04:34----------
say voltage in or something like that

---------04:36----------
sup is new to me I haven't seen it say

---------04:39----------
sup so I'm gonna guess that sup is for a

---------04:41----------
supply

---------04:42----------
so that's input voltage so let's see

---------04:44----------
what we're getting at the input voltage

---------04:46----------
people will often go how do you know

---------04:48----------
where the ins are how do you know where

---------04:49----------
the outs are oh if you what is this

---------04:53----------
thing's purpose this is it you have to

---------04:56----------
try to try to figure out what the

---------04:57----------
purpose of something is you have to try

---------04:59----------
to figure out what the flow is and what

---------05:01----------
the well you know what what this thing

---------05:02----------
is supposed to because it's not always

---------05:04----------
gonna be labeled so here it says from a

---------05:06----------
USBC source and then over here you have

---------05:11----------
a power rail and the power rail over

---------05:13----------
here is smaller than the power rail over

---------05:15----------
here and if this says from that I'm

---------05:17----------
gonna guess that this or section over

---------05:19----------
here is the - so you got to think it's

---------05:22----------
important to be intelligent it really is

---------05:23----------
so what I'm gonna do first is I'm gonna

---------05:25----------
check and see what's present at my

---------05:27----------
supply pin over here and see what the

---------05:31----------
input voltage is and we do have five

---------05:34----------
volts on input now the next thing that

---------05:36----------
we do is decide whether we blame the

---------05:38----------
chip or not

---------05:39----------
so the chip is receiving its input

---------05:41----------
voltage but it's not creating its output

---------05:43----------
voltage so it can either be bad chip the

---------05:46----------
chip is not being enabled hmm I wonder

---------05:49----------
which of these is gonna stand for enable

---------05:52----------
wink wink

---------05:53----------
this is where intelligence is important

---------05:54----------
again or see we have a short to ground

---------05:57----------
on output so let's check and see if we

---------05:59----------
have a short to ground on output that's

---------06:00----------
gonna require that we unplug the

---------06:02----------
multimeter I mean we that we unplug the

---------06:04----------
charger so I'm gonna check for a short

---------06:06----------
to ground on output right here and we

---------06:11----------
get it's not even giving me a

---------06:13----------
measurement here we go 48 kilohms

---------06:15----------
48 km it is no short to ground on output

---------06:18----------
the next thing we're gonna do is we're

---------06:20----------
going to see if this is being enabled

---------06:21----------
let's see if the chip is being told to

---------06:24----------
turn on cuz again boo we cannot blame

---------06:26----------
this chip a lot of people will say ok no

---------06:28----------
power me replace chip no we have to see

---------06:32----------
if the chip is turning on first let's

---------06:34----------
see if it's being asked to turn on first

---------06:36----------
now we have to see if the chip is being

---------06:38----------
asked to turn on first let's take a look

---------06:41----------
the enable is gonna be present at pin 10

---------06:42----------
it says en enable 3.3 volts and if you

---------06:47----------
don't really know what this stuff means

---------06:49----------
you can always copy and paste by

---------06:51----------
right-clicking you can always copy and

---------06:53----------
pick copy and copy and oh wait this ball

---------06:56----------
Daniel software Who am I kidding we're

---------06:58----------
not gonna have things like copy and

---------06:59----------
paste and this GPL alright let's

---------07:02----------
try we don't have copy and paste here so

---------07:04----------
I'm gonna type it in manually max 775

---------07:10----------
nine six let's see if we can find a

---------07:12----------
datasheet on the Internet all right so

---------07:14----------
we're gonna scroll past all this

---------07:15----------
engineering mumbo-jumbo that I this

---------07:19----------
engineering mumbo-jumbo is for people

---------07:20----------
that are smart and here we get to the

---------07:22----------
pin description this is the this is the

---------07:24----------
monkey part of it this is the idiot part

---------07:26----------
of it that this is the part that even I

---------07:28----------
can understand so on the schematic it

---------07:31----------
says let pin ten voltage compatible

---------07:35----------
enable input drive enable - deceit low

---------07:37----------
to disable the device drive enable high

---------07:39----------
to end to enable the device so even if

---------07:42----------
you don't have the intelligence to guess

---------07:44----------
what those words mean all you have to do

---------07:48----------
is find Google the datasheet

---------07:51----------
you can check over here and you can see

---------07:54----------
what this does if you don't understand

---------07:56----------
what su P is like I was kind of confused

---------07:58----------
before I see supply input see supply

---------08:02----------
input if you don't know what the

---------08:04----------
abbreviations are typically you can find

---------08:06----------
a datasheet sometimes you can't find the

---------08:07----------
datasheet cuz apples again apples like

---------08:09----------
that jealous ex-girlfriend don't want

---------08:11----------
you talking anybody else they're gonna

---------08:12----------
tap on the shoulder and say hey in your

---------08:15----------
sale we heard you were giving away a

---------08:17----------
datasheet to some of your is L six to

---------08:19----------
five chips you're not gonna do that with

---------08:22----------
us right you're not gonna let your

---------08:23----------
engineers talk to anybody else and say

---------08:26----------
what the pins on this chip mean right

---------08:28----------
that's what that's what Apple likes to

---------08:30----------
do they like to hide the they like

---------08:33----------
to make sure that the company's making

---------08:35----------
their chipsets don't talk to anybody

---------08:37----------
don't give away any data sheets

---------08:39----------
don't let anybody know what these pins

---------08:41----------
mean make sure that they have to guess

---------08:43----------
when they fix MacBooks so sometimes

---------08:46----------
you're gonna have to rely on your

---------08:47----------
intelligence and your brain because

---------08:49----------
you're not going to be able to find the

---------08:50----------
data tree but I'm confident that if you

---------08:52----------
watch this channel that you're gonna

---------08:53----------
have that

---------08:54----------
elegance and that you're gonna be just

---------08:55----------
fine now let's go back and see what

---------08:59----------
we're getting at the enable pin it's fun

---------09:03----------
that way

---------09:04----------
okay now on the enable pin let's see

---------09:08----------
what we're getting zero volts hmm

---------09:16----------
where does that enable come from well

---------09:19----------
now we got a track down with the enable

---------09:20----------
comes from because clearly the issue is

---------09:23----------
not this chip this chip is not even

---------09:25----------
being told to turn on this chip is not

---------09:28----------
being told to turn on so we can't blame

---------09:30----------
it so that signal is going to come from

---------09:34----------
you seven thousand one of the few

---------09:38----------
benefits of Paul Daniels is software is

---------09:40----------
if I right-click on the signal it'll

---------09:41----------
show me everywhere it shows up on the

---------09:42----------
board

---------09:43----------
so it tells me that it shows up that

---------09:45----------
that signal comes from you seven

---------09:47----------
thousand you seven thousand my old

---------09:49----------
friend the battery charging chip now

---------09:52----------
check this out by the way you want to

---------09:54----------
see how good Apple's schematic drawing

---------09:57----------
engineers are I check this out you ready

---------09:59----------
ready

---------09:59----------
look at this is l6 259 they're still

---------10:03----------
calling it in is l6 259 like they can't

---------10:07----------
edit it this is like my third grade book

---------10:09----------
report see you seven thousand is not ISL

---------10:13----------
six two five nine it's ISL nine two

---------10:15----------
three nine

---------10:15----------
but this chromatic doesn't say that

---------10:17----------
because Apple but anyway I'm sure that

---------10:19----------
they're far more qualified to fix these

---------10:20----------
products than us lowly peasants are it's

---------10:22----------
not likely you know get the model

---------10:25----------
numbers right of the chips on their

---------10:27----------
boards more than they do but whatever

---------10:28----------
I'm not bitter I know so if you look

---------10:31----------
over here this is the ISL nine two three

---------10:34----------
nine so this chip over here is not

---------10:38----------
producing the enable and this appears to

---------10:40----------
be the end of the line so we are going

---------10:44----------
to replace this chip with a better one

---------10:46----------
because this chip which is an ISL nine

---------10:50----------
two three nine not six two five nine

---------11:00----------
just to make sure that they know is not

---------11:04----------
working properly now if you needed to

---------11:06----------
get an ISL

---------11:07----------
nine two three nine if you needed to fix

---------11:10----------
a MacBook and you needed this chip

---------11:11----------
because you weren't getting an enable on

---------11:14----------
your PP 3v3 underscore g3 hot circuit I

---------11:16----------
kind of wonder where it is you could go

---------11:18----------
hmm if you needed an ISL nine two three

---------11:22----------
nine where he to go where the chip is in

---------11:24----------
stock with same-day shipping free

---------11:27----------

---------12:01----------
from store osmond group comm because

---------12:03----------
it's I'm about to demonstrate and I am

---------12:06----------
confident in before I even do the

---------12:08----------
soldering job that's gonna fix our

---------12:10----------
problem this board is gonna turn on and

---------12:12----------
post and give us 20 volts in the charger

---------12:14----------
and all I'm gonna need is a 15 dollar

---------12:16----------
chip from Stuart Rossman group.com let's

---------12:21----------
get started folks I'm gonna get that

---------12:22----------
chip at a slot X 5 which means walking

---------12:25----------
up to the front of the store and oh god

---------12:27----------
it's cold up here it is cold up here

---------12:30----------
BRR it's cold up here I hate it up

---------12:34----------
here there should have put the chips

---------12:37----------
closer to the office let's close the

---------12:39----------
door to the front of the store since

---------12:41----------
it's freezing up here

---------12:46----------
I'll put a little bit of flux over that

---------12:48----------
chip yeah and the flux is gonna keep

---------12:55----------
coming out of the tube because that's

---------12:56----------
what it does we're gonna take that chip

---------13:01----------
right off of the board

---------14:04----------
okay

---------14:41----------
I'll move that cat back in a place in a

---------14:43----------
moment now watch as we replace this

---------14:45----------
little defective is l9 239 and fix the

---------14:50----------
board by replacing this little defective

---------14:51----------
is l9 239 now I'm confident that this is

---------14:55----------
l9 239 from story doc Rossman group comm

---------14:59----------
is as good as it gets I have a hundred

---------15:02----------
ten percent confidence that this will

---------15:05----------
work and allow our pp 3v3 underscore g3

---------15:08----------
ha trail to return to 3.3 volts and

---------15:11----------
allow our cd32 15s to communicate with

---------15:13----------
the charger bada-bing

---------15:22----------
that's a lot of balls

---------16:22----------
our chip has been soldered onto the

---------16:24----------
board now let's see if we get 20 volts

---------16:26----------
on this machine let's see if we get

---------16:53----------
still 5.22 volts well then and now it's

---------16:59----------
20 volts now it's taking 20 volts in 1

---------17:01----------
amp

---------17:02----------
beautiful and just to show you the

---------17:05----------
difference and 1/2 the multiple just to

---------17:12----------
show you the difference we are going to

---------17:14----------
see what we get on the enable pin BAM 5

---------17:23----------
volts on the enable pin for the pp 3 v3

---------17:26----------
underscore g3 hunt regulator 3.4 volts

---------17:28----------
at output of that regulator and as you

---------17:31----------
can see right over here we are getting

---------17:35----------
20 volts on our charger and if I unplug

---------17:40----------
this and plug it back in you might even

---------17:46----------
see it boot it looks like it's taking

---------17:48----------
1.1 am now in point 9 amps so that

---------17:52----------
that's a Macbook that's turning on

---------17:54----------
that's a happy little MacBook that's

---------17:56----------
turning on and just for you haters out

---------17:58----------
there that won't believe anything unless

---------17:59----------
you see the Apple logo on the screen

---------18:01----------
I'll even plug it into the screen for

---------18:04----------
you because I know that the haters are

---------18:06----------
not gonna believe anything that we do

---------18:08----------
works unless they see that we have a new

---------18:10----------
brand of haters recently on this channel

---------18:12----------
that liked to post on the edited videos

---------18:16----------
saying that they're all fake these are

---------18:20----------
edited look at how we quickly edited

---------18:24----------
that and didn't show that this was the

---------18:26----------
same machine and bla bla bla completely

---------18:28----------
unaware that we're actually editing from

---------18:30----------
from live streams so for the haters for

---------18:33----------
the haters let's show this thing working

---------18:36----------
if you're breathing that hard after

---------18:38----------
coughing you're sick you may have

---------18:40----------
pneumonia well I may have pneumonia but

---------18:44----------
this MacBook is fixed and that's what

---------18:48----------
really matters here nobody will care if

---------18:49----------
Luis dies of pneumonia but you know what

---------18:51----------
people will care about if the MacBook

---------18:53----------
that is in their queue is not fixed

---------18:56----------
because the MacBook in the queue must be

---------18:59----------
fixed by the date that the website said

---------19:02----------
it would be fixed by and if it is not

---------19:05----------
then bad things will happen

---------19:08----------
my purpose in this life is to fix

---------19:11----------
MacBooks and as long as I'm here I will

---------19:14----------
fix MacBooks

---------19:21----------
uh-huh so here we have a battery logo

---------19:25----------
this is the eight this is one of those

---------19:27----------
boards where it's gonna require the

---------19:29----------
battery be good in order for it to turn

---------19:31----------
on but it did give us a battery logo

---------19:36----------
meaning that the screen does work

---------19:38----------
meaning that the machine is able to

---------19:40----------
output an image to the screen meaning

---------19:43----------
that it's fine

---------19:44----------
now I'm not going to reassemble the

---------19:46----------
whole thing right now since it requires

---------19:47----------
an ultrasonic cleaning and that's going

---------19:49----------
to be a bit too much work we leave that

---------19:53----------
we move we have that part done by the

---------19:55----------
people downstream but as you see we

---------19:59----------
clearly did allow the charger to

---------20:00----------
communicate with the machine and the

---------20:02----------
machine does have the ability to output

---------20:04----------
an image to the screen and all that good

---------20:06----------
stuff meaning that this job here is most

---------20:08----------
likely done we're just going to move it

---------20:10----------
downstream for reassembly ultrasonic

---------20:13----------
cleaning testing and all that good stuff

---------20:14----------
that is far too boring to do on stream

---------20:18----------
but this is fixed there's a new pet

---------20:23----------
chia-chia pet the pottery that grows

---------20:26----------
it's fun and easy

---------20:28----------
stop your Tia spread the seeds soak your

---------20:31----------
Chia go to treetop reveal keep it

---------20:35----------
watered and watch it grow and now grow

---------20:38----------
on whole collection of fun with Chia

---------20:39----------
teddy bears puppies kittens Rams kittens

---------20:43----------
Rams kittens kittens kittens kittens
