---------00:00----------
hey everybody we're gonna try to do a

---------00:01----------
daily board repair video again so this

---------00:04----------
here is an a 1502 retina MacBook Pro

---------00:07----------
that has no power we're gonna try to

---------00:09----------
figure out why it has no power so let's

---------00:11----------
open it up

---------00:11----------
dig into this machine and see if we can

---------00:14----------
make it work again and as you can see

---------00:15----------
here it's taking 79 milli amps and also

---------00:18----------
we don't get a green light so one thing

---------00:19----------
you should know from my last video is

---------00:21----------
that the no green light could be a

---------00:22----------
number of things it could be pp3 before

---------00:23----------
too short it's a ground it could be PP 3

---------00:26----------
before to missing it could be the power

---------00:27----------
button is stuck so I'm because if the

---------00:30----------
power button is stuck pressed down its

---------00:31----------
gonna think it's trying to do an SMC

---------00:33----------
reset so I just unplug the keyboard

---------00:35----------
because the keyboard is going to be

---------00:36----------
responsible for the power button as you

---------00:38----------
can see we have no change here so I'm

---------00:40----------
going to take the board out of the case

---------00:41----------
and we're gonna see what happens there

---------00:43----------
so let's get the board out of this case

---------00:44----------
and go from there but while we're taking

---------00:47----------
the board out of the case just don't

---------00:49----------
remember that we should have definitely

---------00:51----------
send in the clowns where are the clowns

---------00:54----------
please send in the clowns

---------01:00----------
and we're gonna plug this in again now

---------01:02----------
that everything has been unplugged we're

---------01:03----------
gonna see if that makes any difference

---------01:06----------
doesn't seem to make a damn bit of

---------01:08----------
difference so we're gonna open up a

---------01:10----------
schematic for the eight to zero

---------01:11----------
- for nine to four and Paul Daniels is

---------01:14----------
lovely software available at PL Daniel's

---------01:17----------
comm that's PL Daniel's comm there's an

---------01:20----------
open-source version that you can try

---------01:21----------
that does not include the thing where

---------01:23----------
you'll automatically find signals in the

---------01:27----------
PDF that you right-click on and the

---------01:28----------
board you and vice versa but it's still

---------01:30----------
really good stuff and you should check

---------01:31----------
out his site because he's contributed a

---------01:33----------
bunch of lovely stuff to our industry

---------01:35----------
like the multimeter software that allows

---------01:36----------
you to see the voltage on screen right

---------01:38----------
over there it's good stuff picked at

---------01:41----------
random

---------01:41----------
indeed picked at random first thing

---------01:43----------
we're going to do is check PP 3 V 4 to

---------01:45----------
underscore G 3 hot what do we do here

---------01:47----------
when the Chargers not working if we take

---------01:49----------
a look we have 18 volts and ground and

---------01:53----------
adapter sense adapter sends is going to

---------01:56----------
be what allows the machine to tell that

---------01:57----------
a charge is attached and it's going to

---------01:59----------
also talk to the charger and tell the

---------02:01----------
charger hey you can turn on now I'm

---------02:02----------
attached Thank You Paul Daniels adapter

---------02:08----------
sense is going to be where the SMC

---------02:09----------
speaks to the charger says hi I am a

---------02:11----------
Macbook you can turn on now I'm a

---------02:13----------
Macbook I want my 18 volts so it's going

---------02:16----------
to speak to it over here and as you can

---------02:19----------
see there's a chip this is X on one side

---------02:21----------
and ends on the other side now where it

---------02:25----------
says end on the other side this is going

---------02:29----------
to be where the signal goes to the

---------02:30----------
computer on sis 1 wire and if we take a

---------02:33----------
look we look for sis 1 wire that goes to

---------02:38----------
which ship called the SMC that goes to a

---------02:43----------
chip called the SMC right here it's a so

---------02:49----------
the system management controller is

---------02:51----------
going to be what speaks to the charger

---------02:54----------
but it goes through a chip over here

---------02:56----------
first and in order for that chip that it

---------02:59----------
goes through to work it needs to be

---------03:01----------
getting power now if we check out that

---------03:03----------
chip over here this chip that it needs

---------03:08----------
to go through is powered on its VCC pin

---------03:13----------
and the power from there comes from this

---------03:15----------
chip a logic gate which will send 3.42

---------03:18----------
volts over here

---------03:19----------
if smc bc AC ok is present but this

---------03:21----------
logic gate gets his power from pp3 v4 to

---------03:23----------
underscore g3 Haan

---------03:24----------
so let's see if PP 3v for to underscore

---------03:26----------
g3 hot is present on this MacBook Thank

---------03:29----------
You Sonya for agreeing with my method of

---------03:31----------
anger management so it says that pp 3 v4

---------03:35----------
- on this board can be found I believe

---------03:40----------
somewhere around here there we go

---------03:43----------
BP 3 before to underscore g3 hot so

---------03:46----------
let's see what we get we're gonna turn

---------03:48----------
on Paul Daniels is lovely happy

---------03:49----------
multimeter software which Paul Daniels

---------03:52----------
was so gracious as to donate to the

---------03:54----------
stream and we are going to see what we

---------04:01----------
get

---------04:01----------
and we get 1 point 1 4 volts 1 point 1 4

---------04:06----------
volts is not what we're expecting we

---------04:08----------
need 3.42 volts so the first thing we're

---------04:10----------
gonna do as per that instruction manual

---------04:13----------
that I link to down below a guide on

---------04:14----------
board repair the first thing that we're

---------04:16----------
gonna do is see if we have a short

---------04:17----------
circuit to ground there's many reasons a

---------04:19----------
power rail cannot be present then I go

---------04:21----------
over them in that documents and one of

---------04:22----------
them is a short circuit so let's see if

---------04:24----------
a short circuit to ground is what we

---------04:26----------
have I've changed the multimeter over

---------04:27----------
here to resistance mode one probe on

---------04:30----------
ground the other on output but you have

---------04:33----------
two point eight ohms to ground two point

---------04:36----------
eight ohms to ground means that the

---------04:37----------
power is going straight to ground rather

---------04:39----------
than going to where it's supposed to be

---------04:40----------
going to so we are going to see what it

---------04:43----------
is that's getting hot using what we like

---------04:46----------
to call here the please bro camera so

---------04:49----------
here we have the please bro camera

---------04:51----------
anyway so we're gonna go to display

---------04:53----------
capture over here put the chats on the

---------04:56----------
side so I can see what's relevant and

---------04:59----------
let's see what's getting hot now the

---------05:01----------
please bro camera has what's called the

---------05:03----------
please bro button one sec let me just

---------05:07----------
copy over my power supply transform so

---------05:09----------
that this all looks proper now as you

---------05:11----------
can see the ISL is getting warm but up

---------05:14----------
here the pp 3 4 2 circuit is also

---------05:16----------
getting very warm

---------05:20----------
Yeah right there that's hot that's

---------05:25----------
peepee bus g3 hot so let's see is it

---------05:30----------
this

---------05:35----------
seems like it

---------05:40----------
looks like we may have a bad peepee 3v4

---------05:43----------
to regulator chip so let's go back to

---------05:46----------
the schematic in the board view and see

---------05:48----------
what that thing is if we go back to the

---------05:50----------
schematic and the board view and then we

---------05:52----------
go right over here you'll see that that

---------05:55----------
chip that we're having problems with it

---------05:58----------
looks like the pp3 before to regulator

---------06:00----------
itself this chip is a very simple job

---------06:02----------
with this chip does is it takes the

---------06:05----------
charger voltage which is going to be PP

---------06:08----------
18 V 5 or battery voltage P P bus g3 ha

---------06:12----------
12 point 5 volts or 18 point 5 volts and

---------06:16----------
it turns it to 3.42 volts on output now

---------06:18----------
this chip is 15 degrees hotter than the

---------06:21----------
rest of the board which tells me that

---------06:22----------
perhaps it has failed and it is most

---------06:25----------
likely what is causing my short circuit

---------06:27----------
to ground so I'm going to disconnect the

---------06:29----------
please bro machine I'm gonna say thank

---------06:30----------
you please bro machine because the

---------06:32----------
please bro machine helped me please bro

---------06:34----------
rather than have to use my brain to

---------06:36----------
solve that problem I was able to use the

---------06:39----------
please bro machine to solve that problem

---------06:40----------
so now we're going to take that chip and

---------06:43----------
we are going to replace it with another

---------06:46----------
one you know it doesn't look bad if you

---------06:49----------
take a look over here that doesn't look

---------06:51----------
like a messed up chip at all but it is

---------06:53----------
most likely what is causing my problem

---------06:55----------
now do you guys understand why it is

---------06:57----------
that I went for the PP 3 before to Ralf

---------06:59----------
first because I saw that there was no

---------07:01----------
green light and green light requires PP

---------07:03----------
3 before 2 so I put a small amount of

---------07:08----------
flux there did you get parsall from

---------07:13----------
Amazon I have a bunch of parcels from

---------07:16----------
Amazon at my apartment that I have to

---------07:18----------
bring upstairs I got uh I got a cat

---------07:24----------
litter box a bunch of cat food I have to

---------07:27----------
open and check all the little things

---------07:28----------
because usually weekly for the AMAs I'll

---------07:31----------
thank everybody who sent something and

---------07:33----------
also at work I have greenies if any of

---------07:34----------
those of you thank you so much by the

---------07:36----------
way

---------07:39----------
okay so now I've removed the chip now

---------07:41----------
the first thing I want to do is see if

---------07:42----------
that was actually the cause of my

---------07:43----------
problem all along since it was getting

---------07:46----------
warm I just want to confirm before

---------07:46----------
replace it so I'm going to measure to

---------07:49----------
see if I have a short to ground on pp3

---------07:52----------
before 2 and I actually still do have a

---------07:54----------
short 2 grams on PP 3 before - so the

---------07:56----------
regulator was getting hot because it was

---------07:58----------
pumping too much voltage into it but

---------07:59----------
that was not my actual problem all along

---------08:01----------
so I did something stupid I went off to

---------08:03----------
the thing that was getting hot rather

---------08:04----------
than going after what was actually

---------08:05----------
causing it to get hot that was dumb and

---------08:07----------
that's something that I usually know

---------08:08----------
better at but you know it's been a while

---------08:10----------
so I've been I haven't been doing as

---------08:13----------
much of the slightly more business

---------08:14----------
administration type of stuff so that has

---------08:16----------
been screwing with my skill set and

---------08:17----------
turning you back into an idiot so what I

---------08:19----------
need to do here is I need to not be lazy

---------08:21----------
and actually inject 3 point 4 volts into

---------08:23----------
the system and see what actually gets

---------08:25----------
hot and go from there so I'm going to

---------08:27----------
inject 3 point 4 volts into the system

---------08:29----------
right now and add PP 3 V 4 - using my

---------08:32----------
power supply let's just change the

---------08:34----------
voltage that the power supply puts out

---------08:36----------
because sending 18 volts into that power

---------08:38----------
line will make the board very sad so I

---------08:40----------
put the ground to ground and now I'm

---------08:43----------
going to put the 3 point 42 volts

---------08:46----------
directly on the pp 3 V 4 to

---------09:04----------
okay now we turn the outfit on and it's

---------09:07----------
using one amp so whatever's getting warm

---------09:09----------
should be fairly obvious so I'm going to

---------09:12----------
put the please bro camera back on the

---------09:14----------
screen here so you can all look at the

---------09:16----------
please bro camera now as you can see

---------09:20----------
here the ISL 6259 chip is 87 Celsius now

---------09:25----------
before I thought that the ISL was just

---------09:27----------
getting one because I had a charger

---------09:29----------
plugged in this chip was getting warm

---------09:31----------
and because it was short-circuited

---------09:34----------
so the pp3 before two chip was getting

---------09:36----------
warm it was actually getting about

---------09:37----------
warmer than this because it was

---------09:39----------
supplying this with power and it was

---------09:40----------
shorted rather than address the actual

---------09:42----------
problem I addressed the symptom of the

---------09:43----------
problem and that was dumb that was a

---------09:45----------
dumb thing for me to do it's something I

---------09:47----------
usually tell all of you not to do figure

---------09:49----------
out the root cause of the problem and

---------09:50----------
address that rather than simply dealing

---------09:52----------
with the symptoms and I would have

---------09:54----------
figured that out quicker had I actually

---------09:55----------
injected power I was being lazy the

---------09:57----------
machine was only taking 70 ml amps it

---------09:59----------
wasn't putting out enough power to

---------10:00----------
really tell if there was a short I

---------10:02----------
figured maybe I'll get lucky and

---------10:03----------
something will get hot and something did

---------10:05----------
get hot but - - things got hot at the

---------10:07----------
same time and one would have gotten much

---------10:10----------
hotter than the other if I had actually

---------10:12----------
injected voltage which I didn't do

---------10:13----------
because I was being a lazy ass and I

---------10:15----------
should probably upload this just so that

---------10:16----------
you understand why it's important to not

---------10:18----------
be a lazy ass and how being a lazy ass

---------10:20----------
can trick you so we are going to remove

---------10:22----------
my wire it's no longer needed we're

---------10:24----------
gonna replace the ISL six two five nine

---------10:26----------
with a better one if you want to know

---------10:27----------
where to find an ISO sixty five nine you

---------10:29----------
can find them in store dot rossmann

---------10:31----------
group comm okay

---------10:40----------
so this is our ISL 65:9 chip and also

---------10:44----------
check this out look there's evidence

---------10:46----------
look at that bubbling over there see

---------10:49----------
this

---------11:03----------
by the way if you want to check out get

---------11:05----------
a microscope at the similar quality to

---------11:07----------
mine you may notice that the image

---------11:08----------
quality on this thing is absolutely

---------11:09----------
amazing compared to a lot of the people

---------11:11----------
who do this it's because this microscope

---------11:12----------
allows me to get perfect focus on the

---------11:15----------
trinocular port this can be had at store

---------11:19----------
dot Rossman group com we are selling

---------11:21----------
microscopes

---------11:43----------
the chip didn't really want to come off

---------11:44----------
of the board which is actually something

---------11:45----------
that I'm used to when it comes to chips

---------11:47----------
that die they have a tendency to weld

---------11:49----------
themselves to the board and I was

---------11:50----------
expecting that to be a nasty or under it

---------11:53----------
than it actually was so now I'm going to

---------11:55----------
replace that lead-free solder with some

---------12:00----------
leaded solder and after that I'm gonna

---------12:07----------
it's gonna make it easier for me to wick

---------12:08----------
that leaded solder off of the board

---------12:13----------
solder

---------12:44----------
solder

---------12:54----------
you

---------14:01----------
so let's get an ISL 65:9 put on here and

---------14:05----------
also a new PP three before to regulator

---------14:07----------
put on there

---------14:11----------
[Music]

---------14:19----------
[Music]

---------14:57----------
this does not work as well as the other

---------14:59----------
tips that I was using

---------15:00----------
I don't know how Camille was dealing

---------15:02----------
with that he was Camille managed to find

---------15:05----------
a way to use a tweezer hot tweezers tip

---------15:08----------
on the micro setting pencil and I don't

---------15:10----------
get it

---------15:17----------
also I'm pretty sure that resistor goes

---------15:19----------
somewhere but I'm not quite sure to what

---------15:26----------
that resistor is too small to be in any

---------15:28----------
part of this board here

---------15:49----------
okay now we're gonna replace these two

---------15:51----------
chips these are chips that you could buy

---------15:53----------
on store it out rossman group comm I

---------15:57----------
they suggest you buy them now before the

---------16:00----------
prices go up do the lovely tariffs

---------16:09----------
you get an iso six two five nine down

---------16:11----------
here you can see I tend all those pads

---------16:57----------
we put a proper amount of flux there

---------17:43----------
I'm tending all little circles around

---------17:45----------
the ISL 6259 because I like little tin

---------17:48----------
circles makes me happy don't make fun of

---------17:53----------
me I like my toon circles someone said

---------17:58----------
thank you for all the effort you put

---------17:59----------
into your videos I have been a PC tech

---------18:03----------
for ten years there's no way I could

---------18:04----------
ever demonstrate what I do live like you

---------18:06----------
can I hope you consider writing a book

---------18:07----------
sometime in the future would be the Sun

---------18:08----------
zero of MacBook well a book is not

---------18:11----------
exactly the medium that I would do best

---------18:13----------
at that's why I do everything in video

---------18:16----------
but thank you very very much I really

---------18:18----------
appreciate that thank you

---------18:19----------
seriously thank you so we are going to

---------18:22----------
take this chick over here the regulator

---------18:27----------
that was actually a totally fine chip

---------18:29----------
we're gonna put it over there onto the

---------18:31----------
other board these are both chips that

---------18:33----------
can be purchased at store dot Rossman

---------18:34----------
group com

---------18:36----------
you should probably get one of them now

---------18:38----------
before we get a one or two or three

---------18:40----------
hundred percent tariff but on the rate

---------18:43----------
that we're going now what did USPS say

---------18:47----------
Lois oh this is the best part of it so

---------18:49----------
you know in that USPS video that I did a

---------18:51----------
few days ago where I said that there's

---------18:55----------
this really kind lovely amazing post

---------18:57----------
woman that really puts a lot of hard

---------18:58----------
work and effort in and she does a

---------19:00----------
perfect job remember when I said that

---------19:02----------
and I was speaking so well of that post

---------19:04----------
woman and I said anytime that she takes

---------19:06----------
a day off for vacation that's when

---------19:08----------
things go to and nobody shows up or

---------19:10----------
the person who shows up doesn't scan

---------19:11----------
stuff well guess what happened so at the

---------19:14----------
post office she came by today and

---------19:16----------
apparently I don't know if it's her

---------19:18----------
supervisor the very dude that didn't

---------19:21----------
pick up any of my packages properly or

---------19:22----------
scan them and other people are actually

---------19:24----------
blaming her they're blaming her for the

---------19:26----------
fact that a complaint was filed the one

---------19:28----------
that actually did their job properly

---------19:29----------
every day the one that in the video that

---------19:30----------
I cited in my USPS postal complaint did

---------19:33----------
a good job that's the one that they're

---------19:35----------
good that's the one they're throwing

---------19:36----------
under the bus so they're doing it

---------19:38----------
doesn't seem like anything good as

---------19:40----------
getting done there but I don't think

---------19:43----------
it's the post office I don't expect

---------19:44----------
anything my packages have not moved at

---------19:47----------
all most of those customers at this

---------19:49----------
point have gotten and another one send a

---------19:51----------
lot of the people who've complained we

---------19:53----------
just sent them another one I don't have

---------19:54----------
time to wait so

---------19:56----------
and neither did the customers at that

---------19:58----------
but such as life so we are going to go

---------20:03----------
back here and go around that ship

---------20:13----------
like so get rid of all those little

---------20:15----------
excess solder balls that came out and

---------20:17----------
then plug it in plug it in plug it in

---------20:21----------
like Glade I thought it was really

---------20:24----------
really really lame but they're they're

---------20:27----------
blaming the person that I actually said

---------20:29----------
did a good job rather than blaming the

---------20:31----------
person that I have on camera doing a bad

---------20:32----------
job like the person that I have on

---------20:34----------
camera not doing their job is the one

---------20:36----------
that's not in trouble the one that's in

---------20:38----------
trouble is the one that I made two to

---------20:39----------
three months ends up in that video and

---------20:41----------
said was a great employee

---------20:42----------
let's see what we get now so we have

---------20:44----------
replaced the shorted ship another one

---------20:48----------
the PIPA there is l6 two five nine

---------20:50----------
responsible for our pp bus g3 hot we're

---------20:53----------
gonna plug it in it's not turning on

---------20:54----------
because I still have the power supply

---------20:56----------
sets a three point 4 volts rather than

---------20:58----------
18 so we're gonna change that this is

---------21:03----------
going to be set to eighteen point five

---------21:06----------
volts on on okay as you can see we have

---------21:14----------
a green light

---------21:15----------
but it's only taking 20 milliamps so PP

---------21:17----------
3 V 4 2 has likely been restored so if I

---------21:20----------
were to measure PP 3 V 4 to the first

---------21:22----------
power rail that was missing I would bet

---------21:25----------
that I've got it

---------21:29----------
and I do now pp bus G 3 hot over here

---------21:34----------
this is the AIA by the is l6 two five

---------21:37----------
nine we're getting 12 volts that's not

---------21:40----------
what I would normally expect 12 volts

---------21:43----------
we're supposed to be getting 12 point 56

---------21:44----------
for only getting 12 okay now we got to

---------21:49----------
figure out why that's bouncing back and

---------21:51----------
forth like that see the amperage twenty

---------21:52----------
three thirty six twenty three thirty six

---------21:55----------
twenty two twenty three twenty six it's

---------21:59----------
going back and forth so that's strange

---------22:01----------
so let's take a look around that is l6

---------22:03----------
two five nine area because something

---------22:05----------
funny is going on here since those are

---------22:06----------
you getting twelve point fifty six not

---------22:08----------
that you know let's just check some of

---------22:11----------
the current sensing circuit

---------22:22----------
current sensing is measuring just fine

---------22:50----------
is charged a dcn present

---------22:59----------
painting in vaults

---------23:08----------
pp buses still 12.0 eight that's a funny

---------23:11----------
number

---------23:19----------
let's see if pp5 es5 is present TP 5vs5

---------23:26----------
goes to five volts and then three one

---------23:29----------
zero five volts three one zero okay so

---------23:35----------
we've got a short-circuit on some other

---------23:37----------
rail and we got to find it and what do

---------23:42----------
you know check it out so I noticed that

---------23:45----------
it was power cycling but I mean my power

---------23:46----------
cycling is that we were looking at the

---------23:48----------
amperage the machine was taking it was

---------23:50----------
going from 23 million 237 back and forth

---------23:53----------
back and forth back and forth that's why

---------23:55----------
it's very important of a power supply

---------23:56----------
but you that I use rather than just

---------23:59----------
using a normal charger I want to see how

---------24:01----------
much amperage is taking I want to see

---------24:03----------
what it's doing I want to know what it's

---------24:04----------
doing and just by plugging it in that

---------24:06----------
doesn't tell me what it's doing static

---------24:08----------
voltages don't give me the full story so

---------24:10----------
now what I did right now is I decided to

---------24:12----------
check another set of power rails in the

---------24:13----------
computer that come next so let's just

---------24:15----------
bring those up in the schematic and the

---------24:16----------
board view over here using paul daniels

---------24:20----------
is lovely beautiful amazing software so

---------24:23----------
if we go down here there's gonna be a

---------24:25----------
list of different power rails check this

---------24:27----------
out so it says always present rails so I

---------24:30----------
check PP but g3 hot that was present

---------24:32----------
then I decided to start checking the s5

---------24:34----------
rails has five rails and machines at him

---------24:36----------
beyond when the machine is off so PP

---------24:38----------
5vs5 PP 5vs5

---------24:39----------
was jumping up and down so then I

---------24:42----------
decided let me check PP 5 es 3 another

---------24:45----------
and PP 5 es 3 that's gonna be a rail

---------24:48----------
that supposed to be present while the

---------24:49----------
machine is hibernating just to give you

---------24:51----------
an idea G 3 hot always on as five those

---------24:54----------
are gonna be the rails that are supposed

---------24:55----------
to be on the machines off as three the

---------24:57----------
rail OS for the rails that are on when

---------24:59----------
it's hibernating s three the rails on

---------25:01----------
when it's sleeping as oh the rails that

---------25:02----------
are on when the machine is actually on

---------25:04----------
and being used so for instance s three

---------25:06----------
the machine is sleeping the RAM gets

---------25:08----------
power but the screen doesn't so RAM

---------25:09----------
would be an s3 rail s oh that is a rail

---------25:13----------
that's on the computers and use CPU v

---------25:15----------
core or LCD backlight those RS o rails

---------25:18----------
now I checked the s3 rail over here and

---------25:21----------
that one of that first s3 rail I just

---------25:23----------
happen to get lucky it's shorted to

---------25:24----------
ground zero ohms to ground on PP 5 e s3

---------25:28----------
which is what I was checking on pin 2 of

---------25:31----------
that chip over there I just happen to

---------25:32----------
know that it's there

---------25:33----------
because I've checked it a million times

---------25:34----------
already so let's take a look and see if

---------25:37----------
there's a hardy point on the board where

---------25:39----------
I can inject five volts in there so this

---------25:41----------
board didn't just have one short this

---------25:43----------
board likely has multiple shorts and we

---------25:45----------
are going to attack and make humble

---------25:48----------
every single last one of those short

---------25:50----------
circuits so let's see where I can solder

---------25:54----------
a wire to to inject 5 volt into the

---------25:58----------
board and then we're going to go up

---------25:59----------
slowly from there it looks like on this

---------26:00----------
capacitor over here I can do that right

---------26:02----------
over there so on this campus campus a

---------26:07----------
campus sitter over here we are going to

---------26:09----------
inject fire well we can inject up to 5

---------26:12----------
volts but I want to start with 1 and see

---------26:15----------
what gets warm so let me go back to my

---------26:17----------
power supply software and lower that to

---------26:19----------
1 volt yeah we do have the cursor

---------26:22----------
officer I probably broke something by

---------26:24----------
being a Paul you can code this

---------26:29----------
software as well as you like you're

---------26:31----------
never gonna be able to stop me from

---------26:32----------
being an idiot or a fool so you should

---------26:36----------
stop trying many have tried before you

---------26:40----------
and failed all right so let's just what

---------26:45----------
things on let me just turn you off at

---------26:49----------
the time being

---------26:52----------
all right we're gonna turn this on wow

---------26:56----------
it actually lowers itself 2.71 volts and

---------26:59----------
takes the full 5 amps so at 0.7 volts

---------27:03----------
we're taking a straight-up 5 amps right

---------27:04----------
here it's almost as if I sure it's

---------27:07----------
almost as if I just connected this

---------27:08----------
directly to ground itself that's

---------27:10----------
insanity Sean Hannity so let's take the

---------27:15----------
please bro camera and see what the heck

---------27:17----------
it is that could be taking all of this

---------27:19----------
power on this board so we're going to

---------27:21----------
turn on the please Braille camera the

---------27:23----------
please Braille camera is what's gonna

---------27:24----------
tell us when something's getting warm

---------27:26----------
and let's see what it is that it's

---------27:28----------
taking 5 amps at point 66 volts so it

---------27:32----------
looks like this transistor here is

---------27:34----------
getting a bit warm but let's see what

---------27:38----------
hat what's looking like on the other

---------27:39----------
side of the board yeah this area on the

---------27:44----------
other side of the board is just blank so

---------27:48----------
the only thing I've really got to go on

---------27:49----------
here is this transistor so let's see

---------27:53----------
what that transistor over there is for

---------27:55----------
shall we now if I open up the schematic

---------27:57----------
and the board view cue 7520 well what do

---------28:03----------
you know this the transistor responsible

---------28:05----------
for creating this power line imagine

---------28:07----------
that look this here is our u 75 but this

---------28:12----------
is our TPS 509 eight zero this is

---------28:15----------
responsible for creating PP 5 vs 3 and

---------28:19----------
the transistor that's going to be doing

---------28:20----------
the switching and the pulsing is broken

---------28:22----------
so the way this works the way that we're

---------28:25----------
going to get from 12 volts to 5 volts

---------28:28----------
with the switching power supply is

---------28:29----------
simple so if I want to take your 12

---------28:32----------
volts of the battery over to 5 volts the

---------28:34----------
way I do that is by sending pulses of 5

---------28:36----------
volts through I mean pulses of 12 volts

---------28:39----------
through so here I'm going to send 12

---------28:40----------
volts then 0 then 12 volts then 0

---------28:43----------
now since this is less than half that

---------28:45----------
means that I'm going to want to send

---------28:46----------
this much 12 volts this much 0 this much

---------28:50----------
12 volts this much 0 this much 12 volts

---------28:53----------
this much zero so I'm sending pulses and

---------28:56----------
what's going to happen over here if you

---------28:58----------
is that this chip is going to control

---------29:02----------
and just make this full screen and make

---------29:03----------
it easier for all of you who are

---------29:04----------
watching there at home

---------29:05----------
this chip is going to control this

---------29:08----------
transistor this transistor Scot this

---------29:10----------
over here PP VIN s 5h s whatever the

---------29:12----------
hell of it that's P P bus g3 hot that is

---------29:14----------
going to be the twelve point six volt

---------29:16----------
rail twelve point six volts goes into

---------29:18----------
the transistor the chip tells the

---------29:19----------
transistor open BAM its inch twelve

---------29:21----------
volts through the coil 2 PP 5 es 3 and

---------29:24----------
then it closes and ensign 0 volts

---------29:26----------
through then it opens and sends 12 volts

---------29:29----------
through and then it closes and send zero

---------29:30----------
volts through now that that coil is

---------29:32----------
going to do is it's not going to allow

---------29:33----------
it to switch very quickly it's not good

---------29:35----------
the coil is gonna make things slower

---------29:37----------
it's not going to send 12 0 12 0 it's

---------29:39----------
just gonna wind up setting instead of

---------29:41----------
doing 12 0 12 0 12 0 it's gonna go 5 5

---------29:46----------
so before the coil you've got 12 0 12 0

---------29:48----------
12 0 12 0 and after the coil you've got

---------29:51----------
5 it's gonna get averaged out through

---------29:54----------
that section over here where you've got

---------29:55----------
a coil going to the output and then a

---------29:58----------
bunch of capacitors to ground that's

---------30:00----------
gonna be used for smoothing and also

---------30:01----------
storing some power so that transistor is

---------30:04----------
shorted to ground so now let's take a

---------30:06----------
look at what it looks like under the

---------30:07----------
microscope because it may be telling as

---------30:09----------
to what's going on here I'm also gonna

---------30:11----------
stop sending 5 volts to this machine

---------30:13----------
because that's torturing the poor little

---------30:15----------
thing my chart my power supply is

---------30:17----------
screaming in pain right now and that is

---------30:23----------
the transistor that is our transistor

---------30:28----------
over there

---------32:35----------
okay now we're gonna take a transistor

---------32:37----------
off of the donor and put it on this this

---------32:42----------
is my donor to the right

---------33:03----------
notice that the Trent that this

---------33:05----------
transistor never left my hand now I

---------33:07----------
always have the board that I'm working

---------33:09----------
on under the microscope and the board

---------33:11----------
that I'm not working on away from it

---------33:12----------
because the board that I am stealing the

---------33:15----------
part from I don't really care if I knock

---------33:18----------
something off right next to it that's

---------33:19----------
not what matters to me what matters to

---------33:21----------
me is not losing my component not losing

---------33:23----------
my place so something that I noticed

---------33:25----------
with a lot of newbies is that what they

---------33:28----------
do is they'll have the component the

---------33:30----------
board that they're stealing the

---------33:30----------
component from in the microscope and

---------33:32----------
then they'll they'll take it off and

---------33:36----------
then they'll go oh crap well how am I

---------33:38----------
supposed to get this back onto the new

---------33:41----------
board so they put it down and then they

---------33:43----------
take the new board and they put it under

---------33:44----------
the microscope and by then the little

---------33:46----------
component that they put down it's just

---------33:48----------
gone just poof vanished bye-bye

---------33:51----------
and that's not a good thing so I usually

---------33:57----------
have the component the board that I'm

---------33:59----------
stealing a component from next to it

---------34:13----------
now we're going to turn the power supply

---------34:15----------
back to 18 volts

---------34:25----------
we're going to plug it in

---------34:35----------
see what this thing can do as you can

---------34:38----------
see it's taking 640 milliamps and the

---------34:42----------
fan is spinning the fan is spinning

---------34:44----------
because the power rails now work and the

---------34:46----------
machine is fixed so as I have this is

---------34:50----------
interesting so I had a short circuit on

---------34:53----------
pp3 before to that chip is getting hot

---------34:56----------
when in reality the ISL 65:9 had died

---------34:58----------
and the ISL 6259 after fixing that and

---------35:01----------
pbht three hot being restored in PB

---------35:03----------
three before to being restored we then

---------35:05----------
had a second short circuit on PB 5 es 3

---------35:07----------
and the way we were able to tell that

---------35:09----------
there was an issue there was I saw a

---------35:11----------
power cycling when I say power cycling I

---------35:13----------
mean that my power supply was saying

---------35:15----------
that the board was taking 23 male amps

---------35:17----------
then 37 and was going back and forth in

---------35:19----------
a steady fashion

---------35:20----------
23:37 23:37 23:37 so I decided to start

---------35:25----------
checking out the other rails pp5 es5 was

---------35:28----------
going back and forth back and forth back

---------35:29----------
and forth now what a newbie would have

---------35:32----------
done at that point they would have

---------35:33----------
started trying to troubleshoot pp5 es 5

---------35:36----------
which is not what you do PP 5 es 5 is

---------35:38----------
jumping up and down because of another

---------35:41----------
rail so one of the things to recognize

---------35:43----------
here is that the chip that creates PP 5

---------35:46----------
es 5 right over here u7 501 which is

---------35:49----------
available on stored rossmann group.com

---------35:52----------
this chip over here is not just

---------35:55----------
responsible with BP 5 es 5 it's also

---------35:57----------
responsible PP 3 B 3 s 5 and PP 5 es 3

---------36:00----------
now this one ship is providing three

---------36:03----------
different rails so let's unload me let

---------36:07----------
me try to make an analogy here so if I'm

---------36:10----------
at the gym and I am lifting weights

---------36:13----------
let's say I'm doing benchpress and the

---------36:15----------
person right next to me is doing squats

---------36:19----------
and he hurts himself if he hurts himself

---------36:22----------
doing squats that doesn't stop me from

---------36:23----------
being able to do my benchpress

---------36:25----------
however if I'm doing benchpress and

---------36:27----------
somebody takes a knife and stabs me in

---------36:29----------
the quadricep even though the quadricep

---------36:31----------
is not the set of muscles used for

---------36:33----------
benchpress I'm good I'm good that bars

---------36:34----------
gonna fall on me because you just

---------36:36----------
stabbed me in my quad the same thing is

---------36:38----------
true here whereby even though PP 5 es 5

---------36:41----------
is a totally separate rail from PP 5 es

---------36:44----------
3 PP 5 es 3 is not created from PP 5 es

---------36:48----------
5 these rails

---------36:49----------
nothing to do with one another in terms

---------36:50----------
of sharing a specific power line

---------36:54----------
they both are made by the same chip so

---------36:56----------
since they're both made by the same chip

---------36:58----------
I'm not necessarily gonna see oh is this

---------36:59----------
cap shorted to ground is there a short

---------37:01----------
here what I'm not gonna replace at cps

---------37:03----------
509 zero anything that hurts this chip

---------37:06----------
is going to hurt any of the rails it

---------37:08----------
creates so if there's a little

---------37:09----------
transistor that's hurting my TPS five

---------37:12----------
one nine eight zero this chip is gonna

---------37:14----------
go out short to ground turn off turn off

---------37:16----------
turn off now if the if this transistor

---------37:19----------
is shorted and trying to take five amps

---------37:21----------
out of this thing it's gonna go ah turn

---------37:23----------
off turn off now this chip unfortunately

---------37:26----------
it's kind of dumb you know it's it's

---------37:28----------
this chip cost a few dollars it's not a

---------37:30----------
 genius by any stretch of the

---------37:32----------
imagination so it's kind of dumb so it's

---------37:34----------
not only going to turn off this rail

---------37:36----------
over here that's shorted it's also going

---------37:38----------
to turn off this rail over here that's

---------37:40----------
not shorted so PP 5vs5 jumping up and

---------37:43----------
down was actually a red herring for the

---------37:44----------
fact that PP v es 3 was the rail that

---------37:47----------
had been stabbed in the quadricep and

---------37:50----------
the chip dropped the bar on itself

---------37:53----------
because some somebody stabbed it in its

---------37:55----------
PB v es 3 now after fixing that the

---------37:59----------
board now functions the fan spins and if

---------38:01----------
the fan spins let's face it the rest of

---------38:03----------
the board probably works no need to do

---------38:04----------
any other test and they're pretty sure

---------38:05----------
it's ready to go right back to customer

---------38:08----------
I'm kind of kidding but anyway that's it

---------38:12----------
for today and as always I hope you

---------38:13----------
learned something and again I'm gonna

---------38:15----------
try and put as much effort as I can into

---------38:16----------
doing these videos every single day I

---------38:18----------
want to have a new upload for you every

---------38:20----------
single day we're gonna do our best to

---------38:22----------
make that happen I want this to be a

---------38:24----------
consistently educational channel I got a

---------38:26----------
note from somebody recently and and I

---------38:30----------
got an email from somebody that actually

---------38:31----------
said that they were on welfare and they

---------38:34----------
are now working at a repair company

---------38:36----------
doing this very work here because they

---------38:38----------
were watching the videos and they

---------38:40----------
learned something and stories like that

---------38:41----------
are the tight getting that type of

---------38:44----------
feedback or seeing pictures of the

---------38:45----------
repair shop that people start that's the

---------38:47----------
type of stuff that actually motivates me

---------38:48----------
even if I'm really tired and I have a

---------38:50----------
lot of work to do to come back here and

---------38:52----------
do as much as I can to teach these boys

---------38:54----------
these to teach what it is I'm doing and

---------38:57----------
to also walk you through every step so

---------38:59----------
that it's easy to understand stuff

---------39:01----------
again emails like that like I could get

---------39:03----------
a thousand bad comments a day and like

---------39:06----------
one person that sends something like

---------39:08----------
that is the stuff that makes all of this

---------39:09----------
worth it and I'm going to really try to

---------39:12----------
keep paying it forward and releasing

---------39:14----------
stuff like this this educational because

---------39:16----------
it's it's just there's no feeling like

---------39:18----------
getting like getting emails like that so

---------39:22----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------39:25----------
you learned something

---------39:55----------
excellent data recovery not the best

---------39:57----------
camera

---------40:03----------
what happened Steve what do you think is

---------40:09----------
gonna happen if you're sitting there

---------40:10----------
it's a meter run through it you push
