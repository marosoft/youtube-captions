---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be going over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero 3330 board that I already

---------00:03----------
fixed and as I said what the employees

---------00:05----------
not here I haven't really had the time

---------00:06----------
that I wanted to do the videos so in

---------00:08----------
order to get some of the board repairs

---------00:10----------
done I'm just doing some of them off

---------00:11----------
camera while the during the stores open

---------00:14----------
hours obviously I can't have a camcorder

---------00:16----------
here and talk during business hours

---------00:17----------
because it's hi how can I help you

---------00:21----------
hi how can I help you and it's just like

---------00:23----------
every five seconds as an interruption it

---------00:25----------
would be absolutely impossible so now

---------00:27----------
that that is over I want to talk a

---------00:28----------
little bit about what it is I did to fix

---------00:30----------
this board what was wrong with it and

---------00:32----------
you know what what happened what my

---------00:35----------
thought process was the entire time so

---------00:38----------
this board had a dcn board that was

---------00:40----------
completely destroyed let's see if I have

---------00:43----------
the original one just so that you can

---------00:44----------
get an idea of what that looked like

---------00:46----------
under the microscope here so let's just

---------00:48----------
get the DCN board under the microscope

---------00:50----------
so you can see what this thing looks

---------00:51----------
like it looks really really

---------00:54----------
really really badly that is yeah so when

---------00:58----------
you see a dcn board that looks like that

---------01:00----------
you should know that you're in for some

---------01:01----------
board damage so the first thing that was

---------01:03----------
wrong on this board was that the DCN

---------01:05----------
board fuse was destroyed so this never

---------01:08----------
gets destroyed I knew I was in some for

---------01:09----------
some fun after this because I replaced

---------01:11----------
maybe two of these in years so that is

---------01:14----------
the DCN board fuse poorly Enfocus

---------01:17----------
surrounded by the flux that I forgot to

---------01:19----------
clean away now let's just show you what

---------01:22----------
that is on the schematic over here so

---------01:24----------
let's go over to schematic this is for

---------01:28----------
the eight to zero 3330 motherboard PPD

---------01:32----------
soon

---------01:44----------
okay let's see what the name of that

---------01:45----------
fuse is that I replaced here you are

---------01:49----------
bored

---------01:50----------
yes there you are there you are

---------01:57----------
okay so f6 905 is what I replaced f6 905

---------02:03----------
now I replace this in a head continuity

---------02:05----------
but I still wasn't getting power through

---------02:06----------
the entire machine so what I did is I

---------02:09----------
replaced the inrush limiter let me show

---------02:11----------
you that so the charger power after

---------02:14----------
there the charger power goes over here

---------02:18----------
see this page this is charger power

---------02:20----------
coming in its gonna go through this

---------02:22----------
transistor it's going to go through this

---------02:24----------
current sensing resistor and then this

---------02:27----------
buck converter over here is going to

---------02:28----------
turn that 18 volts of charger voltage

---------02:31----------
into 12 point 6 volts for the machine

---------02:33----------
over here now the problem is is that

---------02:36----------
this you know I replace this and I start

---------02:40----------
getting power but I'm only getting one

---------02:41----------
volt out on the outside of this so I get

---------02:44----------
16 volts going into it I have one volt

---------02:46----------
on the other side of it which means that

---------02:47----------
something is wrong over here so here's

---------02:49----------
what I did to do is whether or not I had

---------02:51----------
additional problems or whether or not

---------02:53----------
this dual MOSFET thingy over here was

---------02:56----------
bad so if you google this and you look

---------02:59----------
it up you'll see that these are two P

---------03:01----------
channel MOSFET so ver here I believe

---------03:03----------
it's very least this one's a p-channel

---------03:04----------
MOSFET over here now the way this is

---------03:06----------
going to work here's how this works this

---------03:08----------
is gonna open and let power through from

---------03:10----------
the source to the drain this is gonna

---------03:11----------
open from here to here only if the power

---------03:14----------
on the gate is lower than the power on

---------03:16----------
the source so the way this works and pay

---------03:18----------
attention here is I need to get the

---------03:21----------
power on the gate lower than the power

---------03:22----------
of the source now you have a voltage

---------03:24----------
divider over here right CR 70 85 and on

---------03:27----------
I 70 86 so if this volt in now and it

---------03:30----------
attaches to this u 7000 chip so if u

---------03:33----------
7000 shorts this to ground over here so

---------03:37----------
let's just get a zoomed out view so this

---------03:39----------
is a voltage divider look what my video

---------03:41----------
is and what is a voltage divider if you

---------03:42----------
don't know what that is this here is a

---------03:44----------
voltage divider you have 16 volts over

---------03:46----------
here you have where you want the power

---------03:47----------
to go over here and then you have

---------03:49----------
another resistor between what you want

---------03:50----------
the power to go and a ground source but

---------03:52----------
instead of putting that to ground you

---------03:54----------
put it to the u 7000 which can switch

---------03:55----------
and say okay let

---------03:57----------
this voltage divider go to ground let

---------03:59----------
this resistor over here go through me

---------04:01----------
and travel to ground or don't provide a

---------04:04----------
path to ground now this voltage divider

---------04:06----------
is not going to work if the bottom of it

---------04:08----------
over here is not given a path to ground

---------04:09----------
it will work if that is given a path to

---------04:11----------
ground so what I did over here is I

---------04:13----------
wanted to check the voltages in this

---------04:15----------
area now I have 16 volts at the top I

---------04:17----------
had 6 volts over here and I had 0 over

---------04:19----------
here this means that this voltage

---------04:21----------
divider is working so if I have 6 volts

---------04:23----------
at the gate and I have 16 volts at the

---------04:25----------
source that means that this being a

---------04:28----------
p-channel MOSFET should open on the

---------04:30----------
power through the computer right it

---------04:31----------
wasn't so when it wasn't doing that

---------04:33----------
again I realized this chip that I had

---------04:35----------
replaced it was actually bad and I know

---------04:37----------
this may surprise you this may surprise

---------04:39----------
a lot of you but when you buy these

---------04:41----------
boards on Alibaba for 15 dollars you

---------04:44----------
really cannot expect that every

---------04:46----------
component that you get on them works

---------04:47----------
especially when I toss them back in the

---------04:49----------
bin like that you may wonder Louis why

---------04:51----------
do you have to buy this stuff on dead

---------04:52----------
boards anyway why can't you just buy

---------04:54----------
that Direct really piece there's two

---------04:57----------
reasons for that the first reason that

---------05:00----------
I'm going to give you is that customers

---------05:03----------
don't want to wait so the amount of time

---------05:05----------
it's gonna take for that thing to get

---------05:06----------
here is actually gonna cause them to

---------05:07----------
decline repair the second thing that I

---------05:09----------
again did this entire business is based

---------05:11----------
on customer impatience that's an

---------05:12----------
important thing the reason that I'm able

---------05:14----------
to make money over other businesses

---------05:16----------
other businesses will say we can do that

---------05:17----------
in two days I say it'll be an hour they

---------05:19----------
say it'll take a week I say it'll take

---------05:21----------
two days they say it'll take an hour I

---------05:23----------
say it'll take five minutes oh because

---------05:25----------
you have to realize everybody walking

---------05:26----------
into this type of business they want the

---------05:28----------
service to be completed before they've

---------05:31----------
actually given you the machine I've had

---------05:33----------
people actually asked like so what is it

---------05:34----------
what's wrong with it and they were

---------05:35----------
irritated that I couldn't tell them that

---------05:37----------
before they let the machine or the

---------05:39----------
device leave their hands there's a lot

---------05:41----------
of impatience going on there so if I

---------05:43----------
have every single little piece I need on

---------05:44----------
those boards that's far more valuable to

---------05:47----------
me than it being actually new there are

---------05:49----------
pieces where it is valuable to be that

---------05:51----------
it is new I do not want to install a

---------05:53----------
used GPU that I ripped off another board

---------05:56----------
because again those are parts where you

---------05:58----------
it really getting a used one is really

---------06:00----------
bad that you want something that is new

---------06:03----------
out of the box I'm not going to install

---------06:05----------
a screen that is used because again that

---------06:09----------
it scratches over time it gets dry

---------06:11----------
to overtime but a little resistor is

---------06:12----------
something like that you know that's

---------06:14----------
gonna last far a lot like that that that

---------06:16----------
little transistor if nobody does

---------06:18----------
anything anyway that will outlive all of

---------06:19----------
us seriously thank you you don't have to

---------06:21----------
worry about that little thing dying at

---------06:23----------
all just because it's it's it's because

---------06:26----------
it's used so anyway so let's try to find

---------06:27----------
this thing right so let's just say I

---------06:28----------
need this little piece so right over

---------06:30----------
here I go to one website the first

---------06:32----------
result that shows up on Google is a PDF

---------06:36----------
let's see what that PDF is so that's a

---------06:38----------
PDF datasheet so it's a from

---------06:41----------
International rectifier and look I'm

---------06:43----------
right it says dual common drain

---------06:45----------
p-channel MOSFETs and again if you go

---------06:48----------
back to the transistor video if you want

---------06:50----------
to know difference between P and n

---------06:52----------
channel from a very very basic

---------06:53----------
standpoint meaning that for this

---------06:56----------
specific type of usage a p-channel means

---------06:59----------
that when the gate is lower than the

---------07:01----------
source you let power through and when

---------07:03----------
the gate is the source or higher than

---------07:05----------
the source power doesn't go through

---------07:06----------
again very very oversimplified

---------07:08----------
explanation solely for laptop schematics

---------07:11----------
and laptop troubleshooting you know

---------07:13----------
again people were getting really up in

---------07:15----------
arms over my definition of a transistor

---------07:17----------
they were really up in arms over like

---------07:19----------
the you know you didn't mention it's not

---------07:20----------
a linear device and blahblahblah and

---------07:22----------
it's like I'm I'm trying to

---------07:24----------
simplify a laptop circuit for somebody

---------07:26----------
who even after watching every one of

---------07:29----------
these videos in my oversimplified

---------07:30----------
definitions doesn't understand how this

---------07:32----------
works and you want me to get into the

---------07:34----------
linearity and the device and everything

---------07:35----------
when they don't even get that like if

---------07:37----------
I'm talking about how an audio amplifier

---------07:38----------
works then it's gonna be very very

---------07:41----------
important for me to say yes a transistor

---------07:42----------
is more than just a variable resistor

---------07:44----------
yes it is not linear yes there are

---------07:46----------
things you have to do to get linear

---------07:47----------
function within specific regions or

---------07:49----------
something close to linear function

---------07:50----------
within specific frequencies and

---------07:53----------
amplitudes and amplification zing yeah

---------07:54----------
again if I'm discussing a high-end video

---------07:57----------
or audio amplifier we need to talk about

---------08:00----------
that we don't need to talk about this

---------08:02----------
for that so if you want to troll and

---------08:03----------
call me an idiot and blah blah blah

---------08:04----------
whatever I can live with that because

---------08:06----------
what I'm trying to do here is what I'm

---------08:08----------
trying to explain how a specific thing

---------08:09----------
works I want you to understand that

---------08:11----------
specific thing and again if I make a

---------08:13----------
video talking about how you know you

---------08:15----------
want to fix addcom and para sound and

---------08:18----------
Rotel amplifiers I'm gonna talk about a

---------08:20----------
transistor a little differently than I

---------08:22----------
do here but for the just for laptop

---------08:24----------
circuits from Mac

---------08:25----------
circuit's when we're looking at a

---------08:27----------
p-channel MOSFET the voltage and the

---------08:29----------
source is it's not gonna go through the

---------08:32----------
drain unless the voltage and the gate

---------08:33----------
it's lower than the voltage of the

---------08:35----------
source so if the voltage in the gate is

---------08:36----------
lower than the voltage of the source and

---------08:37----------
a p-channel MOSFET power goes through

---------08:39----------
the opposite is true for an end channel

---------08:41----------
anyway

---------08:41----------
back to what I was trying to do here so

---------08:43----------
I'm trying to look up a way to buy this

---------08:44----------
thing right wait let's go to Google

---------08:47----------
Shopping nothing there's nothing let's

---------08:51----------
try a Bay com let's search for that

---------08:53----------
piece nothing let's go to Mouser comm in

---------08:57----------
search for this piece nothing let's go

---------09:02----------
to digi-key comm and search for this

---------09:04----------
piece nothing and here's the thing that

---------09:08----------
you got to realize here's why I'm sick

---------09:10----------
and tired of this as a business so

---------09:11----------
people will go like why are why do you

---------09:14----------
always say that this is a terrible

---------09:15----------
profession why do you say that you know

---------09:17----------
that computer repair is going away why

---------09:19----------
do you say that you know you should be

---------09:20----------
looking at do things other than

---------09:21----------
motherboard repair I enjoyed doing this

---------09:23----------
to some extent but one thing that really

---------09:25----------
really tires me and then I get irritated

---------09:26----------
at is that there is no support from the

---------09:28----------
manufacturer for any of these products

---------09:30----------
if I want to install a security system

---------09:31----------
not only are they my encouraged to go to

---------09:35----------
the manufacturers schooling in classes

---------09:38----------
on how to use their equipment but they

---------09:40----------
will offer me ongoing support for if I

---------09:42----------
want to do that let's say you want to be

---------09:43----------
in the security industry the people who

---------09:45----------
get you licensed want to teach you how

---------09:47----------
to do this stuff the people who you deal

---------09:50----------
with as your vendors they will suggest

---------09:51----------
ways that you can do things better and

---------09:53----------
things that may save you money and

---------09:55----------
things that you should have that you

---------09:56----------
probably don't have they work with you

---------09:58----------
in the laptop motherboard repair

---------10:00----------
business you are considered a prick if

---------10:02----------
you're like me and you give away

---------10:03----------
information on how to do this like there

---------10:05----------
are so many people that think that what

---------10:06----------
I'm doing needs to stop that I am just

---------10:08----------
ruining a business by teaching people

---------10:10----------
how to do things

---------10:11----------
manufacturers think that again like if

---------10:13----------
they give me a source for that little

---------10:16----------
transistor that the world is going to

---------10:18----------
 end you are constantly working

---------10:21----------
against the grain to get anything done

---------10:23----------
I'm sick and tired of working against

---------10:25----------
the grain I want to work in an industry

---------10:26----------
where if I need this dual p-channel

---------10:29----------
MOSFET that I can simply go to a website

---------10:31----------
order it give them money again take my

---------10:34----------
money and it shows up I don't want to

---------10:37----------
work in an industry where I have to lay

---------10:39----------
you know a import boards with

---------10:41----------
holes in them and pray that the

---------10:42----------
works

---------10:43----------
anyone so you can't buy this thing

---------10:45----------
anywhere so that's why I use donor

---------10:47----------
boards so I replace that for the second

---------10:50----------
time and it worked and the way I was

---------10:51----------
able to tell that it wasn't working the

---------10:53----------
way it was supposed to the way I was

---------10:54----------
able to tell that the transistor that I

---------10:56----------
took off was bad so that I wouldn't you

---------10:59----------
know go ahead and start driving myself

---------11:00----------
nuts in the rest of the board was again

---------11:02----------
just by using my brain a little

---------11:04----------
remember again a p-channel MOSFET is

---------11:06----------
going open when the voltage and the

---------11:08----------
source is higher than the voltage in the

---------11:11----------
gate this here in the datasheet says

---------11:13----------
it's a p-channel MOSFET so again let's

---------11:15----------
go back to my schematic let's go back to

---------11:17----------
my board schematic here so I measured it

---------11:21----------
all these points so I have 16 volts over

---------11:23----------
here this goes to the source I have 16

---------11:25----------
volts here I have 6 volts on my gate

---------11:27----------
none of my output I have one so this is

---------11:30----------
not letting power through when it

---------11:32----------
supposed to which means that it is yeah

---------11:33----------
so I replace the dual p-channel MOSFET

---------11:37----------
again the reason you by the way the

---------11:39----------
reason I say transistor when a lot of

---------11:40----------
you say like you should say Mouse fed or

---------11:42----------
whatever it's not a transistor a MOSFET

---------11:45----------
kind of is a type of transistor and B

---------11:47----------
transistor is just an easier thing to

---------11:49----------
say when it's late and I'm tired than a

---------11:51----------
dual p-channel MOSFET in rush limiter

---------11:54----------
like excuse me for abbreviating and as

---------11:56----------
you can see the fan spins which means

---------11:59----------
that as I like to joke on this channel

---------12:01----------
I'm done and all is good so that's that

---------12:04----------
and again this is how you can figure out

---------12:06----------
is it the part that's bad or is it

---------12:08----------
something around the part that's bad

---------12:09----------
because again let's go back to this if I

---------12:12----------
have if I have 16 volts on my gate and

---------12:16----------
16 volts on my source and it's not

---------12:17----------
opening am I gonna replace this no I'm

---------12:21----------
not gonna replace this because it's not

---------12:22----------
being told to open but if I have 16

---------12:24----------
volts on my source and 6 volts on my

---------12:26----------
gate and it's not opening am I going to

---------12:28----------
replace that true that a dual p channel

---------12:31----------
in rush limit or reverse current

---------12:34----------
protection MOSFET yes I am because it's

---------12:37----------
not doing the job that it is supposed to

---------12:39----------
and that's that so I hope you learned

---------12:43----------
something sorry that it wasn't in real

---------12:44----------
time I just haven't at the time to do a

---------12:45----------
lot of these in real time was the staff

---------12:48----------
on vacation but when I can if I have

---------12:50----------
time instead of reassembling the Machine

---------12:52----------
a medial

---------12:52----------
what I'm gonna try to do with some of

---------12:53----------
these videos instead of reassembling it

---------12:55----------
immediately and when I do fix these

---------12:57----------
boards over the course of the day with

---------12:58----------
the customers calling me and people

---------13:00----------
walking in and blah blah blah I'm gonna

---------13:02----------
put these boards to the side I'm gonna

---------13:04----------
put the computer to the side and once I

---------13:05----------
close and I'm done I'm gonna explain

---------13:07----------
what I did so that I can still kind of

---------13:08----------
give you the insight that I do into

---------13:10----------
these repairs even if you're not

---------13:11----------
necessarily watching the soldering job

---------13:13----------
in real time
