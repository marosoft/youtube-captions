---------00:00----------
so here we have a little MacBook we're

---------00:02----------
gonna put our 18 volt charger here turn

---------00:06----------
it on unplug the battery and see how

---------00:09----------
many amps are drawn and it appears to be

---------00:11----------
drawing 0.02 amps 0.02 amps is

---------00:15----------
indicative of a p.m. sleep s4l failure

---------00:17----------
absolutely we're gonna fix p.m. sleep

---------00:19----------
s4l and we're gonna do a live on stream

---------00:21----------
or I all Paul another bike so but if I

---------00:28----------
fix it

---------00:29----------
then Paul owes me what 40,000 shares of

---------00:32----------
a gr extra worth just a few months ago

---------00:33----------
so so we're going to open all this up

---------00:38----------
and get this p.m. sleep s4l it'll work

---------00:41----------
again and it's still drawing 0.01 9 amps

---------00:43----------
that's no good so we're gonna go down

---------00:46----------
our list of power rails and see which

---------00:48----------
ones are not present and which ones are

---------00:50----------
present so now we've got a green light

---------00:51----------
so our pp 3 before 2 is gonna be present

---------00:53----------
next up we're gonna check our pp bus 8

---------00:57----------
volts on one side

---------01:05----------
and zero volts on the other could this

---------01:07----------
just be a bad pee pee bus g3 hot fuse

---------01:11----------
Wow okay eight point six volts on one

---------01:13----------
side of the PP bus g3 hot fuse zero on

---------01:16----------
the other there's a chance that this

---------01:17----------
butter board may be nothing other than a

---------01:19----------
bad fuse our fuse is indeed blown now

---------01:27----------
let's see if there's a short to ground

---------01:28----------
on the other side of the fuse and there

---------01:30----------
is okay so our pp bus is short it's a

---------01:33----------
ground and when I say pp bus let me show

---------01:35----------
you what I mean when I buy pp bus if you

---------01:37----------
look over here the first power rail is

---------01:39----------
our pp bus which needs to be g3 hot

---------01:43----------
g3 hot means always on at all times

---------01:46----------
so it's a g3 hot rail it should always

---------01:48----------
be on and that rare that g3 hot rail is

---------01:51----------
called pp bus the chip that creates pp

---------01:54----------
vestry 3 hot it's gonna be you 7100 hue

---------01:58----------
70 100 is going to take voltage from the

---------01:59----------
charger up here from adapter and make it

---------02:03----------
into eight point five volts for the

---------02:05----------
system this here is the fuse between the

---------02:08----------
side that creates pp bus g3 hot and the

---------02:10----------
system and on one side of the fuse we

---------02:13----------
get 8.6 and on the other zero and the

---------02:15----------
reason is because the fuse as you can

---------02:17----------
see when we put it into resistance

---------02:18----------
measurement has blown open line and the

---------02:22----------
reason it's blown is because there's a

---------02:23----------
short circuit on one side of the fuse so

---------02:25----------
now we have to inject voltage and figure

---------02:27----------
out what it is that's getting hot on

---------02:28----------
this board what is causing our short to

---------02:30----------
ground now very often on these MacBook

---------02:32----------
Airs

---------02:32----------
what's causing the short to ground is a

---------02:34----------
capacitor by the CPU v core circuit so

---------02:38----------
I'm gonna look in this area and see if

---------02:39----------
any of these caps look suspect

---------02:47----------
and as you can see there are capacitors

---------02:50----------
here that have little solder balls next

---------02:52----------
to them that's that that's just typical

---------02:54----------
great Apple manufacturing quality so

---------02:57----------
look at that that cap has a solder ball

---------03:00----------
next to it this cap also has a solder

---------03:03----------
ball next to it and as Paul has noticed

---------03:05----------
in some of these boards many of them

---------03:07----------
have dat little solder balls just

---------03:08----------
running around even if one cap was bad

---------03:10----------
that wouldn't explain why numerous of

---------03:12----------
them have solder balls running around

---------03:14----------
but go Apple create quality control

---------03:17----------
manufacture different think different if

---------03:20----------
Paul's using the federal count I will

---------03:21----------
use the alcohol method and the alcohol

---------03:23----------
method will find the short just fine

---------03:25----------
just you wait I'm gonna lower the

---------03:27----------
voltage and the power supply down a 1

---------03:30----------
volt so one end is gonna have to go to

---------03:34----------
ground

---------03:46----------
and the other end is going to go to our

---------03:48----------
pp bus

---------04:51----------
off on

---------04:59----------
hmm

---------05:25----------
can I see thermal cam

---------05:33----------
Wow how did I miss this

---------05:36----------
[Music]

---------05:40----------
I'm not doing this because the Union

---------05:42----------
repair paid me I promise

---------05:43----------
I've on Union repairing of the

---------05:45----------
thermal camera enough times yeah so I

---------05:48----------
spend ten minutes with alcohol and now I

---------05:52----------
just found it in a minute with this it

---------05:56----------
works every other time I think my

---------05:58----------
alcohol chops have gotten bad because I

---------06:00----------
haven't you have been getting lazy and

---------06:01----------
using this thermal camera okay so the

---------06:04----------
thermal camera found this short that I

---------06:05----------
couldn't happy props where props is due

---------06:09----------
yeah go Union repair I didn't get paid

---------06:14----------
for that I mean I got the thermal camera

---------06:17----------
for free but I've been on it

---------06:19----------
for six months since I got it for free

---------06:21----------
so that doesn't really count how many

---------06:24----------
times have I on this thermal camera

---------06:26----------
audience yeah you guys know who have

---------06:28----------
been watching for a while

---------06:41----------
oh yeah the power in Jack on this yeah

---------06:52----------
show the people 189 see that's

---------06:55----------
inaccurate that's supposed to be 500 see

---------06:57----------
wait

---------07:21----------
I'm sorry Union repair for saying that

---------07:23----------
this thermal camera was a useless piece

---------07:25----------
of I apologize I was wrong

---------07:28----------
this thing does have some uses after all

---------07:32----------
the software on the other hand with it

---------07:35----------
like rent needs to be translated like

---------07:38----------
this despite this Chinese button over

---------07:40----------
here

---------07:42----------
yeah and the install come on it's nine

---------07:44----------
hundred bucks but still Union repair my

---------07:47----------
apologies I'm a [ __ ] this is actually

---------07:51----------
pretty decent afterall when I'm when

---------07:53----------
you're when you're wrong you should say

---------07:55----------
that you were wrong and I was wrong and

---------07:57----------
I'm not eating your pizza that just

---------08:01----------
because you put a tiny bit of green

---------08:03----------
on your pizza doesn't mean it's healthy

---------08:08----------
it's kind of cool to solder in the

---------08:10----------
thermal camera yeah instead of the

---------08:13----------
microscope mobile fix I'm still adamant

---------08:15----------
that this thing is very low resolution

---------08:16----------
what changes with this software is that

---------08:18----------
when you click a button it will show you

---------08:20----------
what the absolute hottest point is and

---------08:21----------
ignore everything else so it's still low

---------08:24----------
resolution but that little feature in

---------08:26----------
the software makes it more usable so

---------08:28----------
that you're not driving yourself nuts to

---------08:30----------
figure out what exactly the hot thing is

---------08:34----------
so that takes the low resolution of the

---------08:37----------
camera but turns it into something that

---------08:38----------
you can actually kind of work with

---------08:52----------
yeah it's not drawing anything strong

---------08:55----------
0.06 it's there's no more short short is

---------08:58----------
gone

---------09:06----------
there you go now we don't need a fuse

---------09:08----------
anymore

---------09:23----------
these actually blows anyway

---------09:32----------
we'll MacBook fans spin okay 18 volts

---------09:40----------
greenlight fans spin so it's fixed it's

---------09:49----------
fixed so that's it thank you very much

---------09:54----------
for watching as always I hope you

---------09:55----------
learned something we had a shorted cap

---------09:57----------
on PP buss g3 hot I found it at the

---------09:59----------
Union repair calm thermal imager and my

---------10:02----------
apologies for saying that that thing was

---------10:04----------
useless it's not useless it's just

---------10:05----------
vastly overpriced in my opinion that's

---------10:08----------
it for today and as always I hope you

---------10:10----------
learned something

---------10:11----------
