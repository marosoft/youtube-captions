---------00:00----------
hi today I'm gonna be continuing with

---------00:02----------
the component-level motherboard repair

---------00:04----------
video series one thing to know if you're

---------00:06----------
new to the channel this is not the video

---------00:07----------
you should start at because I am moving

---------00:09----------
a little bit quickly as I am trying to

---------00:10----------
catch up after getting back from

---------00:12----------
practical board repair school I've been

---------00:13----------
away for a week which means I have a lot

---------00:15----------
of work to do which means I'm not really

---------00:17----------
gonna be going through every single step

---------00:19----------
with the schematic on the screen I am

---------00:21----------
gonna be skipping through so if you are

---------00:22----------
not familiar with this video series

---------00:24----------
already watch the older videos in this

---------00:26----------
series if you want to learn board or

---------00:28----------
pair probably not this one so the first

---------00:30----------
thing I do is I go to see if I have a

---------00:31----------
green light in the charger when I plug

---------00:33----------
the charger in and I don't have a green

---------00:35----------
light now one of the things that I look

---------00:36----------
for is that there is three point 42

---------00:39----------
volts on PP 3 v 4 to when I go to

---------00:41----------
measure 4 PP 3 V 4 - on this board I get

---------00:44----------
0 volts so now what I'm gonna do is I'm

---------00:47----------
gonna check for a short to ground so

---------00:48----------
when I check for a short to ground I

---------00:50----------
mean diode mode red probe on ground

---------00:52----------
black probe on P B 3 B 4 - I get 0 volts

---------00:56----------
no zero volt drop which means that there

---------00:58----------
is no voltage drop between my pal rail

---------01:00----------
and ground which is bad so what I'm

---------01:02----------
going to do now is I'm going to

---------01:04----------
disconnect the inductor that sits

---------01:06----------
between the pp 3 V 4 - power supply in

---------01:09----------
the board I want to see what side my

---------01:11----------
short-circuit is on so I have to wait

---------01:14----------
for this thing to heat up anyway so even

---------01:16----------
if I wanted to move really fast here

---------01:18----------
there's not I gotta wait for this data

---------01:20----------
so since I'm gonna wait for it to heat

---------01:21----------
up I might as well show you what it is

---------01:23----------
I'm moving here so I'm removing l69 9 v

---------01:29----------
alright so this is what I'm going to be

---------01:31----------
removing good open broadcaster make sure

---------01:39----------
you're still all right so this is pp 3 V

---------01:42----------
4 to underscore G 3 hot power supply now

---------01:45----------
this is where pp 3 V 4 2 is being

---------01:47----------
created and this is where it's sending

---------01:49----------
it to the machine is it this side that's

---------01:51----------
shorted or this side that's shorted is

---------01:52----------
it the machine side where all the

---------01:54----------
components being powered by PB 3 before

---------01:56----------
- were shorted or is it the chip that's

---------01:57----------
creating I don't know so I'm gonna

---------01:59----------
remove this and then we're gonna see so

---------02:01----------
what I'm doing here is I'm trying to

---------02:02----------
isolate the cause of the of the fault

---------02:04----------
think of it like you got two kids that

---------02:06----------
are really misbehaving right so you got

---------02:08----------
two kids that are misbehaving and

---------02:10----------
they're screaming and they're bitching

---------02:12----------
and shits

---------02:13----------
knocked down the room one way to figure

---------02:15----------
out which kids at fault because kids

---------02:16----------
never admit which one is actually the

---------02:17----------
one doing the the stuff that's wrong it

---------02:20----------
would be to put the kids in two separate

---------02:22----------
rooms so you put each kid into a

---------02:23----------
separate room and then you observe and

---------02:25----------
see what's going on so if you walk in a

---------02:27----------
one room and you see that the kid is is

---------02:30----------
sitting down everything's there the way

---------02:32----------
it's supposed to and acting nice and you

---------02:34----------
won't in the other room and everything's

---------02:35----------
not go over and broken and the kid is

---------02:37----------
screaming then you'll you'll kind of get

---------02:39----------
an idea which kid probably started it

---------02:41----------
same thing here I really don't know

---------02:43----------
which side this short is on so just to

---------02:45----------
narrow things down a little bit I am

---------02:47----------
going to remove the coil and the coil

---------02:50----------
flew away but luckily I caught it so

---------02:53----------
let's see what side the short is on so

---------02:56----------
I'm going to check on both sides now if

---------03:00----------
it's on the left side that means it's

---------03:01----------
the creating a creation of pp3 before to

---------03:03----------
that short that's not shorted at all

---------03:07----------
good measurement and the system side is

---------03:10----------
zero point zero zero zero voltage drop

---------03:12----------
which means that there is a short to

---------03:14----------
ground on the system side now the way

---------03:16----------
that I'm gonna find that is I'm going to

---------03:18----------
solder a wire from my power supply to

---------03:21----------
where 3.42 voltage buzzer show up on the

---------03:24----------
board right there and I'm gonna sigh to

---------03:30----------
the ground of the power supply to my

---------03:32----------
screw now what's gonna happen here is

---------03:34----------
whatever component is shorting my bp3

---------03:37----------
before to the ground is going to get

---------03:39----------
really really hot really boiling hot and

---------03:42----------
that's going to make it easy for me to

---------03:44----------
figure out which one it is so yeah

---------03:49----------
that's just standard you know wire that

---------03:52----------
I cut out of an Ethernet patch cord

---------03:56----------
nothing special here just ten the wire

---------03:59----------
so it sticks better

---------04:04----------
the board pad has been tend and now the

---------04:06----------
wire has been tinned doesn't have to be

---------04:11----------
the greatest outer join in the world

---------04:12----------
it's not like this is permanent work

---------04:14----------
this is just for testing only but it's a

---------04:18----------
 if it falls off so all right so

---------04:22----------
now that is attached and now what I'm

---------04:24----------
going to do is we're gonna go over to my

---------04:25----------
HP 65-42 a power supply here I mean I

---------04:30----------
set the power supply to three point four

---------04:34----------
to five volts and the current as high as

---------04:37----------
it goes and we're gonna turn it on and

---------04:40----------
it's putting zero point zero zero four

---------04:44----------
amps which is not a short at all

---------04:48----------
man that's well let's see if

---------04:51----------
the rest of the machine works so let's

---------04:53----------
see if this thing will turn on and give

---------04:56----------
me as sunny would say a nice long dong

---------04:59----------
so I'm going to put the RAM in I'm going

---------05:08----------
to put a speaker on it and a fan and I'm

---------05:13----------
going to plug it in we're just gonna put

---------05:15----------
pp 3 v 4 2 and then plug it in and see

---------05:18----------
if this works

---------05:18----------
so PP 3 V 4 2 is going and plugging it

---------05:23----------
in I get a green light

---------05:25----------
I get fan spin the fan is spinning and

---------05:30----------
do I get a nice long dong no dong what

---------05:39----------
it does turn on that gives me some hope

---------05:46----------
let's see what I get on a screen this is

---------05:49----------
great I love this little wireless body

---------05:51----------
pack thing that I got for this mic they

---------05:53----------
should have gotten this a long time ago

---------05:54----------
getting up is so much easier when doing

---------05:57----------
a video not having an XLR cable drape

---------06:00----------
around everywhere right so I have to get

---------06:05----------
the proper LCD cable out of here

---------06:09----------
you're not proper you're burned alright

---------06:12----------
so I can walk to the next room with ease

---------06:14----------
oh boy this is great I can walk to the

---------06:18----------
next room without having to unplug

---------06:20----------
and plug it back in this is gonna be

---------06:23----------
great for my exercise

---------06:38----------
okay I have the proper LCD cable turn

---------06:42----------
this off I'm turning it off from the

---------06:45----------
power supply now let's see what I get on

---------06:48----------
the screen if I get anything so I didn't

---------06:50----------
get a nice long dong but that doesn't

---------06:52----------
necessarily mean that we're done for

---------06:53----------
just yet okay turn it on charger one

---------06:59----------
wire circuit go go go and it turns on so

---------07:02----------
it has a brain this thing has the

---------07:04----------
ability to turn on and work which is you

---------07:07----------
know again that's good news the problem

---------07:10----------
here again is that there's something

---------07:12----------
keeping PP 3 before 2 from appearing now

---------07:15----------
one of the things that I'm kind of

---------07:16----------
afraid of right now that I really hope

---------07:17----------
didn't happen what if the short circuit

---------07:19----------
was so minor that I blew it out of the

---------07:23----------
board immediately by just putting 3.42

---------07:26----------
volts through now if there's no short

---------07:28----------
now what's gonna happen is this probably

---------07:30----------
some capacitor is something that blew

---------07:32----------
and I can't see it because this board

---------07:34----------
honestly looks perfectly fine it looks

---------07:36----------
beautiful it looks like water never

---------07:38----------
touched it it looks like a knockoff

---------07:40----------
charger never touched it it looks like

---------07:42----------
it's original owner never touched it

---------07:44----------
which we can really just kind of worries

---------07:46----------
me so let's see what happens when I

---------07:47----------
remove the power supply let's see if the

---------07:50----------
short circuit is still there and you

---------07:52----------
know again cuz when the machine is off

---------07:54----------
what I don't have the charger plugged in

---------07:55----------
or any of that stuff it's delivering

---------07:58----------
0.04 amps which honestly is not it's

---------08:02----------
just it's just not really a

---------08:03----------
short-circuit that that's nothing so I'm

---------08:07----------
going to try and measure for a

---------08:08----------
short-circuit again so I'm in diode mode

---------08:12----------
on the multimeter I have red probe on

---------08:15----------
ground black probe on PP 3v for 2 and it

---------08:20----------
looks like it went away I have no idea

---------08:22----------
what the happened I really have no

---------08:25----------
damn clue and this is a board that looks

---------08:28----------
pretty good nothing really wrong with it

---------08:31----------
so this is one of those things where I'm

---------08:33----------
gonna be checking every single little

---------08:34----------
feature I mean like how many can you

---------08:37----------
read all the cycles from the battery

---------08:39----------
microphone does the microphone input

---------08:42----------
work webcams like all these stupid

---------08:44----------
little things to make sure that every

---------08:47----------
single little thing works because

---------08:48----------
something may actually wind up not

---------08:49----------
working on here when it leaves

---------08:52----------
and I don't I don't want that to happen

---------08:54----------
but you have to kind of know which ones

---------08:56----------
that's going to be on and on something

---------08:59----------
where the short magically disappears and

---------09:01----------
you don't even see a poof and yeah I'm

---------09:03----------
seared the power supply did not draw

---------09:04----------
anything it wasn't like it spiked for an

---------09:06----------
amp or two amps or three ohms for a

---------09:08----------
second in the one away I mean it's stuck

---------09:10----------
at zero point zero for amperage use

---------09:13----------
which is nothing oh stop doing it listen

---------09:18----------
coil come back here mouthful okay we're

---------09:28----------
gonna twist you in a place in a second

---------09:45----------
seriously oh wait duh my air is turned

---------09:49----------
up too high that's pretty dumb stop that

---------09:55----------
and I could use some sleep

---------09:58----------
here's the thing about teaching so after

---------10:02----------
a week of like answering questions on

---------10:04----------
board repair you may want a short break

---------10:07----------
from border pair but you can't take that

---------10:10----------
break from border care when you haven't

---------10:11----------
been fixing boards for a week because

---------10:13----------
you could you come back to work at the

---------10:15----------
business that you own where you're the

---------10:16----------
only one that fixes boards what do you

---------10:18----------
think is gonna be if you are not there

---------10:20----------
for a week a week's worth of board

---------10:23----------
repair there's a chance I put this coil

---------10:26----------
on upside down that would be

---------10:27----------
embarrassing I really hope I didn't do

---------10:29----------
that

---------10:29----------
oh god it's never the coil unless the

---------10:33----------
coil is upside down that would be

---------10:37----------
embarrassing

---------11:00----------
I'm about as happy as I'm going to get

---------11:02----------
with that so same idea same principle so

---------11:07----------
I got that on there's no more power

---------11:09----------
supply in the mix I'm gonna plug the

---------11:11----------
screen and the fan and all the RAM and

---------11:13----------
all that good stuff in and we're gonna

---------11:14----------
see if this thing turns on so before it

---------11:16----------
had zero green light it was totally dead

---------11:18----------
useless worthless junk and again second

---------11:22----------
board today

---------11:23----------
I have no clue what I did but I fixed it

---------11:27----------
and we get a green light and we get a

---------11:30----------
fan spin and we get uh bada-bing

---------11:32----------
bada-boom a working machine

---------11:35----------
so again microphone circuitry got a goal

---------11:39----------
for that because some of that is powered

---------11:40----------
by pp 3 V 4 2 sometimes there are some

---------11:42----------
annoying little caps and the audio

---------11:44----------
circuit that happened to go that could

---------11:45----------
be what happened here and there is

---------11:47----------
something that I have to put in the

---------11:48----------
notes to test for you know knowing how

---------11:50----------
all this stuff works makes it a lot

---------11:51----------
easier to not look like an idiot

---------11:53----------
so I've been through this chromatic

---------11:54----------
enough times to know that there are

---------11:55----------
annoying things in the pp 3 V 4 - line

---------11:57----------
by the audio circuitry that just for

---------11:59----------
some reason decide to do stupid things

---------12:01----------
for no reason but this worked it's

---------12:04----------
finished I'm happy hope you learned

---------12:07----------
something
