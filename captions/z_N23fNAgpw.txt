---------00:00----------
people how's it going so today we're

---------00:01----------
gonna get started working on a Macbook

---------00:03----------
that randomly shuts down this is and

---------00:06----------
from the pawl queue we're gonna see how

---------00:08----------
hard this is if this is something that

---------00:09----------
is fixable or not so let's get started

---------00:12----------
we're gonna put the desk camera over

---------00:14----------
here zoom out a little so you can see

---------00:16----------
what it looks like on the inside

---------00:17----------
and we're gonna examine this so this

---------00:22----------
looks like a 2013 MacBook Air this is an

---------00:25----------
8 - 0 - 34:37 board it should be easy to

---------00:28----------
find that number so you can read it as

---------00:30----------
you can see I was reading it from right

---------00:31----------
here right underneath the SSD c8 - 0 -

---------00:34----------
34 37 really easy to find so we are

---------00:37----------
gonna take the screws out of this

---------00:38----------
macbook air board and take it out of the

---------00:41----------
machine see what we can do to get this

---------00:43----------
thing working again why are you working

---------00:46----------
on the weekends says Bobby Hardcastle I

---------00:48----------
am working on the weekend because I

---------00:50----------
would like to move to a nice new store

---------00:52----------
that is not claustrophobic and miserable

---------00:54----------
and that is going to cost a lot of money

---------00:56----------
so the work that I do now is gonna pay

---------00:59----------
off when I wind up moving to that place

---------01:01----------
that actually allows me to do business

---------01:05----------
like a dignified human being rather than

---------01:08----------
like a sardine and it's gonna happen

---------01:11----------
we're gonna make it happen

---------01:13----------
alright we're gonna take a look over

---------01:14----------
this board in the good old microscope

---------01:16----------
and you'll tell me if you see anything

---------01:19----------
that looks out of the ordinary are you

---------01:23----------
ready 1 2 & 3 let's go over this board

---------01:35----------
dust so we look through the board huh

---------01:43----------
what do we have going on over here hmm

---------01:49----------
and the rest of the machine looks fine

---------01:52----------
we just got some pubes some green probe

---------01:55----------
points by the BIOS chip that could use a

---------01:57----------
little bit of touching up you don't want

---------01:59----------
to have green stuff near BIOS chip and

---------02:03----------
the CPU slash PCH and then we're gonna

---------02:05----------
get initialized properly so first thing

---------02:08----------
we're gonna do is focus on this pp three

---------02:10----------
or four to underscore g3 hot area over

---------02:12----------
here I can show you what that is by

---------02:14----------
opening up the Paul Daniels software so

---------02:16----------
let's open up a board view for an eight

---------02:18----------
to zero

---------02:19----------
- 3437 and get started and oh my god it

---------02:24----------
opened itself up in the proper

---------02:26----------
orientation the first time that never

---------02:27----------
happens

---------02:28----------
everybody say thank you to the Paul

---------02:30----------
Daniel software for working today

---------02:32----------
alright so we're going to go over here

---------02:35----------
to you 7090 and what is this circuit for

---------02:38----------
oh my god can you smell that

---------02:40----------
it's permeating everything it smells so

---------02:43----------
funny alright so here we have is the

---------02:47----------
circuit required for making people

---------02:48----------
through before 200 square G 3 hot

---------02:52----------
[Music]

---------02:57----------
my white balance button is actually not

---------02:59----------
working anymore hmm

---------03:00----------
there we go

---------03:07----------
what these are not tweezers what is this

---------03:12----------
this is a duckbill next

---------03:29----------
now it looks like somebody was trying to

---------03:31----------
clean corrosion and actually knock that

---------03:32----------
stuff off because you could see there

---------03:34----------
was a piece of the cap still there and

---------03:35----------
there's also a piece of the resistors

---------03:37----------
still there so I'm going to replace

---------03:41----------
those even the ones that are still

---------03:43----------
soldered on there just cuz I don't

---------03:44----------
really trust them right now

---------03:59----------
yeah it burned because it was it's time

---------04:01----------
to burn it burned because it was it's

---------04:05----------
time to burn

---------04:13----------
to everything burn burn burn there is a

---------04:19----------
season burn burn burn and at times it

---------04:26----------
looks like we're missing a probe point

---------04:28----------
over here there we go this is where the

---------04:34----------
disconnect is this was too corroded to

---------04:38----------
pass or maybe not maybe we can actually

---------04:40----------
revive it with a little bit of flux and

---------04:42----------
some solder no high voltage no

---------04:54----------
let's see

---------05:00----------
all right so you brought that back next

---------05:04----------
is gonna have to happen for the rest of

---------05:06----------
the pads you don't want to solder on top

---------05:07----------
of corrosion you want to scrape away the

---------05:10----------
corrosion

---------05:31----------
it is the season burn burn burn

---------05:36----------
[Music]

---------06:52----------
it is the season turn bang bang this

---------06:58----------
season

---------07:12----------
it's any when you want some fun relaxing

---------07:14----------
links yeah I saw the nerf thing thank

---------07:19----------
you

---------07:20----------
but fortunately at the moment I just

---------07:23----------
don't have the time to look into nerf

---------07:26----------
stuff after I'm done with this

---------07:47----------
this section of the board just looks

---------07:48----------
like scorched earth disgusting so we'll

---------07:52----------
see if it turns on in a moment and I

---------07:57----------
agree go over these Pro points I was

---------07:59----------
talking about for the SPI ROM not gonna

---------08:04----------
just leave that there like that 6:02

---------08:07----------
p.m. the contract show up and start

---------08:09----------
working we got somebody who's got keys

---------08:12----------
that wants to start working on it

---------08:14----------
tomorrow

---------08:14----------
I had some other people come in bid but

---------08:19----------
the thing is there were a lot of

---------08:21----------
questions that they had that I believe

---------08:24----------
were questions that I'm not really

---------08:27----------
qualified to answer it's kind of like

---------08:28----------
I'm looking that up with this so what

---------08:31----------
I'm looking for when I was a recording

---------08:33----------
engineer I would try to say is so what

---------08:36----------
kind of sound is your band looking for

---------08:38----------
it show me the stuff you know send me

---------08:41----------
some stuff that you is what you want to

---------08:42----------
sound like right

---------08:43----------
I wouldn't say do you want me to use ash

---------08:46----------
or sm58 or Roy or 121 ribbon or

---------08:50----------
something on your guitar I would try to

---------08:52----------
figure out you know what are you looking

---------08:54----------
for and okay now it's my job to make you

---------08:56----------
know try to get you there or tell you no

---------08:58----------
that's [ __ ] ridiculous you're not

---------09:00----------
gonna do you that's not gonna happen

---------09:01----------
that's you know but it was on me to do

---------09:05----------
that and yeah I found no really nice

---------09:07----------
contractor actually a nice guy but it

---------09:10----------
seemed like there was one contractor who

---------09:12----------
essentially knew what I was looking to

---------09:14----------
do knew my situation knew the way I

---------09:16----------
wanted it to look knew what was

---------09:17----------
bothering me knew what corners to cut

---------09:20----------
what corners not to cut and knew that I

---------09:21----------
was working on an app very limited

---------09:23----------
budget due to lack of loan and budget

---------09:26----------
deficits so he's and he made the

---------09:29----------
suggestions as to you know what I should

---------09:31----------
do what I shouldn't do like this and he

---------09:34----------
seems like he knew his [ __ ] and that's

---------09:36----------
kind of what I need I don't really need

---------09:38----------
say do you want I need somebody who's

---------09:41----------
gonna tell me why their way is the best

---------09:44----------
way for me who knows that it's gonna you

---------09:48----------
know just gets in there gets it done

---------09:50----------
immediately you know gives me a quote

---------09:52----------
immediately and it was pretty fair it

---------09:54----------
was the guy that gave the most

---------09:56----------
reasonable quote for redoing the 30th

---------09:58----------
Street location he gave a very

---------09:59----------
reasonable

---------10:00----------
quote can contrast to the others for the

---------10:02----------
30th Street location so I have an idea

---------10:05----------
that you know I'm not getting too [ __ ]

---------10:07----------
you know obviously it's gonna be quite a

---------10:10----------
bit read to the floor in there fix up

---------10:12----------
the wiring that's coming out of the wall

---------10:14----------
the ceiling you know smooth out the

---------10:17----------
sections that are have you know broken

---------10:20----------
up sheetrock or drywall but it's gonna

---------10:25----------
be it'll work well so I imagine they'll

---------10:28----------
be done in about a month they said a

---------10:30----------
month which means probably two months

---------10:31----------
because he's a contractor he's a good

---------10:34----------
contractor but at the end of the day

---------10:35----------
he's still a contractor and being a

---------10:37----------
contractor means you're probably gonna

---------10:38----------
say it's gonna be one price at one

---------10:40----------
amount of time when it's actually

---------10:41----------
another price or another amount of time

---------10:44----------
that's just the nature of of the

---------10:47----------
contractor you know there's not really

---------10:48----------
much you can you can do there okay just

---------10:58----------
a small amount of flux there

---------11:08----------
yeah

---------11:17----------
yes and he's probably going yep yep

---------12:35----------
I got a fan spin

---------12:42----------
and it's going to turn on off on off on

---------12:44----------
off on as all 3437 s do but there we go

---------13:00----------
[Music]

---------13:08----------
Pinky and the brain brain brain brain

---------13:11----------
brain brain brain brain pinky

---------13:14----------
let's pinky in the brain brain brain

---------13:16----------
brain brain and this MacBook works and

---------13:20----------
now we can move on to another one joy

---------13:24----------
I'll have this ultrasonically cleaned

---------13:26----------
and tested and reassembled all nice and

---------13:28----------
proper by the reassembly department here

---------13:30----------
at rossmann repair but that's here

---------13:33----------
Monday through Friday
