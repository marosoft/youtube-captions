---------00:00----------
welcome to phone Mart how may I help you

---------00:03----------
iPhone 4 where is the iPhone 4 I need an

---------00:06----------
iPhone 4s let the MacBooks pile up your

---------00:09----------
health is more important no actually it

---------00:11----------
isn't

---------00:12----------
let's see what's wrong with little

---------00:13----------
MacBook little MacBook is only taking 9

---------00:16----------
milliamp s' why is little MacBook only

---------00:19----------
taking 9 mill amps

---------00:20----------
one way to find out let's get this

---------00:22----------
MacBook Board out of here and now the

---------00:24----------
MacBook is taking thirty five milliamps

---------00:25----------
but not turning on

---------00:27----------
let's check the power rails on this

---------00:28----------
MacBook the first thing we're going to

---------00:30----------
do is go through the list of power rails

---------00:31----------
let's check our PP bus PP Buster III

---------00:34----------
Hunt is supposed to be eight point six

---------00:36----------
volts if you go to the other side of the

---------00:39----------
board and we check our PP bus what do we

---------00:45----------
get eight point six volts on PP bus next

---------00:50----------
round PP v RTC underscore g3 hot

---------00:53----------
let's do we get on this one alright 3.3

---------00:57----------
volts next up PP 5 vs 5 5 volts

---------01:04----------
pp 5 vs 4 appears to be missing and it's

---------01:12----------
not being told to turn on imagine that

---------01:15----------
so p.m. sleep s4l is missing on this

---------01:18----------
board let's see if it's pulsing so we're

---------01:21----------
gonna check over here for the enable do

---------01:25----------
you pulse my friend

---------01:32----------
aha and now we have corrosion here is

---------01:37----------
the reason that perhaps we are not

---------01:39----------
getting tall Singh look at that what's

---------01:42----------
this this is you 1950 your 1950 is going

---------01:46----------
to be to logic gates in one this logic

---------01:49----------
gate says if all says power good and CPU

---------01:52----------
V arm power go to present send out p.m.

---------01:56----------
SOP good and if p.m. SOP good or present

---------01:59----------
an SMC delay power get a present from

---------02:00----------
the SMC then allow sis power ok to come

---------02:05----------
out and go to the PCH this signal is

---------02:08----------
going to be needed p.m. PCH power ok is

---------02:11----------
important for many things p.m. PCH power

---------02:15----------
ok is going to be one of the signals in

---------02:16----------
the PCH system power management section

---------02:18----------
and remember we need all of the inputs

---------02:21----------
in order to get all of the outputs and

---------02:24----------
one of the outputs on this side is PM

---------02:26----------
sleep s4l p.m. sleep s4l is going to be

---------02:31----------
what turns on my 5 volt rail here so if

---------02:35----------
we look by 5 volt as for rail is not

---------02:39----------
turning on over here that turns on or is

---------02:43----------
enabled 1 p 5 vs 4 RS 3 p good as

---------02:46----------
present p 5 vs 4 RS 3 p good is going to

---------02:54----------
come p 5 vs 4 RS 3 enable

---------03:13----------
and that comes from PM's leave s4l so

---------03:16----------
this is going to explain our entire

---------03:18----------
problem right here

---------03:24----------
[Applause]

---------03:31----------
burn corroded ship burned

---------04:06----------
now of the eight pads here which is the

---------04:10----------
one that's corroded the one that's

---------04:13----------
corroded appears to be pad responsible

---------04:19----------
for power so we take a look on a board

---------04:23----------
view software here the pp3 before to

---------04:25----------
underscore g3 hard power pad one that

---------04:27----------
delivers power is the one that is broke

---------04:38----------
I do

---------04:41----------
what

---------04:45----------
now

---------04:47----------
no I didn't write on any battery yet

---------05:07----------
this conical tip is disgusting

---------06:17----------
we have revealed the pad

---------06:27----------
now we're gonna take a chip from a donor

---------06:37----------
all right that's gonna settle in a place

---------06:39----------
in a moment

---------06:49----------
beautiful

---------06:55----------
push down on the board

---------07:27----------
as can be seen the fan spins which means

---------07:31----------
that we're done with our worked here

---------07:32----------
today so this board was missing p.m.

---------07:35----------
sleep s4l we went through the list of

---------07:37----------
powell rails pp5 es 4 RS 3 was missing

---------07:40----------
when we looked we noticed that the

---------07:42----------
enable was missing that enable tracks

---------07:44----------
back to p.m. sleep s4l which comes from

---------07:46----------
the cpu / PCH which usually means short

---------07:51----------
to ground somewhere bios or spi ROM

---------07:53----------
traces broken so it's not communicating

---------07:55----------
and initiating the PCH to turn on these

---------07:57----------
rails or CPUs dead in this case it wound

---------08:01----------
up being you 1950 was broken and missing

---------08:04----------
the 3 point 42 volts going to the chip

---------08:06----------
so he restored it and it worked and

---------08:09----------
here's the funny part II is the really

---------08:11----------
interesting part of this entire scenario

---------08:12----------
p.m. sleep best for all was missing

---------08:14----------
right well typically you need p.m. sleep

---------08:17----------
s4l to be present before p.m. PCH power

---------08:21----------
ok comes to be present so let me show

---------08:23----------
you this so this is responsible for

---------08:27----------
taking all this power good and CPU VRP

---------08:30----------
good and making p.m. SOP good and then

---------08:33----------
if p.m. sop good is present with SMC

---------08:35----------
delayed power good then you get p.m. PCH

---------08:38----------
says power ok but keep in mind all

---------08:41----------
sisters not going to show up until

---------08:43----------
you're in an Esso state and if we're

---------08:45----------
missing p.m. sleep s4l then we're not

---------08:47----------
even in the nest for state so how is it

---------08:49----------
that p.m. sleep s4 L was not showing up

---------08:52----------
because a chip was broken that creates a

---------08:56----------
signal that only shows up when you're in

---------08:58----------
an Esso state I repeat you need to be in

---------09:01----------
an Esso state to have all sis pal good

---------09:04----------
be present this chip is only going to

---------09:06----------
create these signals if you're in an

---------09:07----------
Esso state that chip being damaged

---------09:10----------
caused us to not even be in an s4 state

---------09:14----------
I don't get it but I don't need to know

---------09:20----------
because I made the fan spin see see you

---------09:26----------
think I'm smart I'm not I'm a janitor I

---------09:29----------
walk across the board with my little mop

---------09:32----------
and my mr. clean I just do it in a

---------09:34----------
microscope is all and you think I'm

---------09:36----------
special for that because I do it in a

---------09:38----------
microscope and you do it in the aisles

---------09:40----------
of Walgreens but it's

---------09:41----------
all the same principle I have no idea

---------09:44----------
why this works

---------09:45----------
I really don't and I probably won't for

---------09:48----------
a very long time again just to be clear

---------09:51----------
here all sisterhood this signal is not

---------09:55----------
present until we're in an Esso state

---------09:56----------
this this chip take CPU VRP good and

---------10:00----------
also spare good and makes p.m. SOP good

---------10:03----------
of it and then takes PM sop good and SMC

---------10:06----------
delayed power good and makes p.m. sis

---------10:08----------
PCH power ok our problem with this board

---------10:12----------
was that we were missing an s4 line

---------10:15----------
because the enable for the s4 line was

---------10:17----------
not present how is it that by fixing a

---------10:21----------
chip area that all only deals with SLE

---------10:24----------
power signals that we fixed our s4 rail

---------10:29----------
but I fixed it and that's all that

---------10:31----------
matters is an adult you don't have to

---------10:33----------
know why it works you just have to know

---------10:35----------
that it works and then you can collect

---------10:37----------
the money with that we move on to the

---------10:39----------
next board repair I also want an iPhone

---------10:42----------
4 don't even get me started with that

---------10:45----------
 where is my iPhone 4 I want an

---------10:48----------
iPhone 4 get the out of my store
