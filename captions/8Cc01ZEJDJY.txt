---------00:00----------
all right so today we have an a 1502

---------00:02----------
MacBook and it says no power let's open

---------00:05----------
this thing up and try and figure out why

---------00:06----------
it has no power and see if we can make

---------00:08----------
it work again all right so the first

---------00:14----------
thing that I like to do on these

---------00:16----------
machines is I like to see how much power

---------00:18----------
it's taking without the battery plugged

---------00:22----------
in because if the battery is plugged in

---------00:23----------
it's going not gonna let me know exactly

---------00:25----------
what the board is taken by itself it's a

---------00:27----------
troubleshooting methodology so if I know

---------00:31----------
how much power the board is taking then

---------00:33----------
I may have an idea as to where I should

---------00:35----------
begin with my troubleshooting process so

---------00:38----------
I am going to plug in the then turn on

---------00:44----------
this power supply software here it works

---------00:46----------
great so 24 milliamp s-- may have a

---------00:50----------
light but we have 24 milliamps being

---------00:52----------
taken 24 milliamps most of the time is

---------00:54----------
missing p.m. sleep s4l one of our

---------00:56----------
favorite problems so let's unplug

---------00:59----------
everything from the machine and see

---------01:00----------
where we go from there we listen any

---------01:02----------
podcast that we favorite one I enjoy

---------01:04----------
some of the Scott Galloway podcast

---------01:06----------
okay so we've unplugged everything from

---------01:08----------
the casing I remember 24 milliamps is

---------01:10----------
typically a missing PM sleep s4l I've

---------01:13----------
realized that because on other boards

---------01:14----------
where I was taking 24 mm so I would

---------01:16----------
troubleshoot and I would see that p.m.

---------01:18----------
sleep s4l is missing now p.m. sleep s4l

---------01:20----------
is a signal that's going to be required

---------01:23----------
in order for the charger I mean in order

---------01:26----------
for all the s4 rails to get turned on so

---------01:29----------
p.m. sleep s4l is power management sleep

---------01:33----------
s2 and s4 state when low I want you to

---------01:38----------
be awake I don't want you to sleep so I

---------01:40----------
so that signal needs to be present so

---------01:42----------
that it doesn't sleep now this is an 8 -

---------01:45----------
0 - 4 9 - 4 board so we're gonna open a

---------01:47----------
schematic and a board view here using

---------01:49----------
Paul Daniels a software that as usual is

---------01:51----------
drunk and thank you very much for it -

---------01:54----------
Poupon I highly appreciate it but yeah

---------01:56----------
this here is drunk so as you can see

---------01:58----------
what's happening is the board is opening

---------02:02----------
in a different orientation than it is on

---------02:04----------
the desk because apparently in Australia

---------02:06----------
they do vertical video and they fix

---------02:08----------
their boards like this now if you if you

---------02:11----------
do this in America and then you fix the

---------02:13----------
board like

---------02:13----------
in Australia that I can understand but

---------02:16----------
who the [ __ ] fixes the board like this

---------02:17----------
like this is just no nobody nobody on

---------02:20----------
planet earth fixes a board in this

---------02:22----------
[ __ ] position this is insanity but

---------02:24----------
that is the very orientation that Paul

---------02:27----------
Daniels a software will open the board

---------02:29----------
to by default this ridiculous Australian

---------02:33----------
upside down backward ass

---------02:34----------
toilet flushing [ __ ] why and in true

---------02:42----------
Apple fashion not only does he do that

---------02:44----------
but he changes the shortcut to rotate

---------02:46----------
the board from the old version to this

---------02:49----------
version absolute [ __ ] madman like dr.

---------02:54----------
Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog I can

---------02:55----------
just see his teeth grinning and his

---------02:58----------
moustache twisting though what am I

---------03:00----------
talking about PM sleep s4l so let's just

---------03:02----------
go through our so when it's not turning

---------03:04----------
on the first thing that you want to do

---------03:05----------
is check through your list of power

---------03:08----------
rails so this is the list of power rails

---------03:13----------
and several of those power rails are

---------03:15----------
rails that are s3 or as for as for a

---------03:18----------
state like this now there is a chip that

---------03:21----------
creates some of those power rails you

---------03:23----------
7501 you 7501 is going to create PP 5 es

---------03:27----------
3 as well as PPE 3 B 3 S 5 now let's

---------03:31----------
check out how this is enabled so it

---------03:33----------
looks like the 5 volt line of this chip

---------03:35----------
s 3 rail is enabled by P 5 vs 3

---------03:38----------
underscore enable and if we trace that

---------03:40----------
back to where it is coming from you'll

---------03:46----------
see that that comes from P 5 es 3 en D

---------03:54----------
so usually underscore L means that's

---------03:57----------
present when it's low and I guess

---------03:59----------
underscore diene means it's enabled when

---------04:01----------
you have dick so this P 5 vs 3 enabled

---------04:07----------
dick comes from p.m. sleep best for L

---------04:09----------
p.m. sleep best for L is gonna come from

---------04:12----------
the CPU / PCH that PCH is integrated

---------04:15----------
into the CPU here but it's the same

---------04:16----------
general principle the PCH is creating it

---------04:18----------
now that's signal let's see if that's

---------04:21----------
present I'm probably is not because it's

---------04:24----------
taking 24 milliamps

---------04:26----------
right so we plug the thing in well you

---------04:30----------
have that on the screen where you gonna

---------04:31----------
turn on Paul Daniels is multimeter

---------04:33----------
software let's see what orientation that

---------04:35----------
[ __ ] shows up in on the screen all right

---------04:37----------
at least some of the software appears to

---------04:38----------
be sane and we are going to measure and

---------04:41----------
see what's present on pin 4 of this chip

---------04:44----------
and go from there so here we have the

---------04:48----------
TPS five one nine nine zero chip and it

---------04:51----------
looks like we have zero volts on p.m.

---------04:53----------
sleep s4l BAM see so now we're gonna

---------04:58----------
take a look around the board and see if

---------04:59----------
there's anything that sticks out to us

---------05:01----------
as to why that's not present now

---------05:02----------
sometimes it's not present because the

---------05:05----------
clock chip is not creating a clock

---------05:08----------
signal could be it what doesn't seem to

---------05:11----------
be here I have a little corrosion on

---------05:12----------
this stuff above it but that stuff is

---------05:14----------
kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme

---------05:17----------
of things that though those are for CJ

---------05:20----------
tech rubbish and it's not now when Jay

---------05:23----------
tags are corroded that can be bad

---------05:24----------
because little short things to each

---------05:26----------
other but over here

---------05:27----------
nothing is shorted directly to something

---------05:29----------
right next to it so I'm not necessarily

---------05:31----------
as concerned about that although we'll

---------05:33----------
come back to the fact that this poles

---------05:34----------
where Pro point should be later now if

---------05:37----------
we take a look around here let's see do

---------05:40----------
we have any shorted caps because often

---------05:42----------
you'll have a shorted cap in the corner

---------05:43----------
that messes up the 5 volt rails and

---------05:46----------
they'll move back and forth but I don't

---------05:47----------
think that's the case here because when

---------05:49----------
you have a short circuit on a rail and

---------05:51----------
p.m. sleeve s4l is missing typically

---------05:54----------
it'll be pulsing so it'll go try to turn

---------05:56----------
on notice a short and go up off on out

---------05:59----------
off and that'll repeat itself so you'll

---------06:01----------
see it go three zero three zero three

---------06:02----------
zero and that's not happening here so

---------06:04----------
we're just gonna continue our trip

---------06:05----------
around the board what is you what be

---------06:14----------
what what are you doing oh oh oh ouch

---------06:18----------
alright this is a common corroder on the

---------06:20----------
air on the a 1466 models this is

---------06:24----------
important so what this does is if you

---------06:27----------
have all six our good and P P 3 v 3s Oh

---------06:33----------
present with CPU VR P good people pretty

---------06:35----------
much as long as you have see this little

---------06:38----------
pole

---------06:39----------
signal over here and all says power good

---------06:41----------
it'll create PMS Oh pika now if you have

---------06:43----------
PMS Oh P good because else is power good

---------06:45----------
is present meaning only wrestle rails

---------06:46----------
are there and SMC delay power good which

---------06:48----------
comes from the SMC you will get

---------06:50----------
something called assist power ok which

---------06:52----------
turns to the PM PCH says power ok now

---------06:55----------
let's take a look at the page that we

---------06:56----------
find the signal on shall we so if we

---------06:59----------
click through you'll see that there is

---------07:00----------
this page for PCH power management

---------07:03----------
system power management in this page is

---------07:05----------
put together a lot nicer than it is on

---------07:07----------
some of the schematics for the new

---------07:08----------
MacBooks so what I like about this page

---------07:10----------
is there's a pattern you have all these

---------07:13----------
ends no left and outs on the right so in

---------07:15----------
order for you to have all your PMS Li

---------07:17----------
best 5 LS 4 l and 3 L in order to enable

---------07:20----------
your rails to turn on you need to have

---------07:22----------
these being present and something tells

---------07:24----------
me when the chip that creates that rail

---------07:26----------
looks like this they're not present this

---------07:28----------
is a chip that can be purchased on store

---------07:29----------
dot Rossman group comm and we are going

---------07:32----------
to replace it right now and see if that

---------07:35----------
fixes our problem and then we can

---------07:37----------
address the issues around the jtag

---------07:38----------
connector area but first let's address

---------07:40----------
this why is Eli the computer gay hates

---------07:45----------
you I want to punch a stupid face about

---------07:47----------
after talking ish about you what's the

---------07:50----------
mic you use for your life experience

---------07:53----------
videos help me I use this rode videomic

---------07:56----------
thing it's I like it it's some rode TRS

---------07:59----------
shotgun mic Evo and I are just people

---------08:02----------
that have a typical back and forth I

---------08:05----------
don't hate you I I don't dislike Eli I

---------08:07----------
listen to his videos sometimes I agree

---------08:10----------
with what he has to say sometimes I

---------08:11----------
don't agree or disagree but it provides

---------08:14----------
thought-provoking content sometimes I

---------08:15----------
think what he's saying is ridiculous but

---------08:17----------
it is a thought process and we both are

---------08:21----------
just adults that disagree every now and

---------08:23----------
then and also adults that like to give

---------08:26----------
each other [ __ ] so we both occupy this

---------08:28----------
really strange niche on YouTube of

---------08:30----------
long-form one to two hour-long

---------08:32----------
instructional videos that most people

---------08:35----------
are going why is the video so long why

---------08:37----------
is the video so long why is the video so

---------08:39----------
long why is the video so long and we

---------08:41----------
also occupy this strange niche where

---------08:43----------
people say we really like your

---------08:44----------
educational content make more of it but

---------08:46----------
when we make more of it nobody watches

---------08:48----------
it so and we both generally we can

---------08:52----------
to YouTube it the same idea so he had a

---------08:54----------
successful business and then moved on to

---------08:56----------
YouTube is not like his life was started

---------08:57----------
from YouTube I came onto YouTube and I

---------09:00----------
was about three and a half four years

---------09:02----------
into my business or yeah you know it's

---------09:04----------
four years into my business already my

---------09:05----------
repair business when I came on here so

---------09:08----------
we both and we both also did not

---------09:11----------
envision there being

---------09:13----------
tens of thousands of people watching it

---------09:14----------
wasn't like that was ever the goal we

---------09:16----------
both suck at creating thumbnails we both

---------09:18----------
suck at editing so there's a lot of

---------09:21----------
similarities there even if there are

---------09:22----------
differences and things like whether or

---------09:23----------
not I'm going to go out of business or

---------09:26----------
go bankrupt similar to his computer

---------09:27----------
repair shop in 2009 that offered about

---------09:29----------
half the services that we do that are

---------09:30----------
value of the customers did I just say

---------09:33----------
that although anyway so what I'm going

---------09:35----------
to do here yeah I don't I don't hate to

---------09:38----------
do it at all we just disagree every now

---------09:39----------
and then and because we disagree and

---------09:41----------
what grown-ups we like to give each

---------09:42----------
other's [ __ ] and that that is that is

---------09:44----------
what it is I like giving you like [ __ ]

---------09:46----------
and every now and then I'm sure he likes

---------09:47----------
giving me [ __ ] but at the end of the day

---------09:49----------
it's all it's all just friendly back and

---------09:52----------
forth and banter and the other thing is

---------09:58----------
like I can appreciate where he's coming

---------09:59----------
from when he says I don't give a [ __ ]

---------10:01----------
about anybody any of the viewers etc and

---------10:03----------
so forth when he says you know I want

---------10:05----------
you to lead a good life but I never want

---------10:06----------
to meet you

---------10:06----------
I honestly I get that because I feel the

---------10:09----------
same way about you know many people on

---------10:11----------
YouTube are and honest about certain

---------10:13----------
things like that like I'm you know if

---------10:14----------
you I try to be nice to people but at

---------10:18----------
the same time I try to also you know I'm

---------10:21----------
not your friend I'm not your family

---------10:23----------
member I'm a dude on the internet I

---------10:26----------
don't know we we also seem to have the

---------10:29----------
same general what's the word I'm looking

---------10:31----------
for we have the same general thoughts

---------10:38----------
with regards to social behavior and you

---------10:41----------
know being confused by social norms and

---------10:43----------
getting along with people or lack of

---------10:47----------
getting along with people anyway

---------10:57----------
quality is dropped low yeah so what I

---------11:00----------
would suggest that you do if you don't

---------11:02----------
like the quality of the stream or the

---------11:03----------
bitrate that I'm forced to stream at I

---------11:05----------
would highly suggest that you call

---------11:07----------
spectrum and ask them why the [ __ ] they

---------11:09----------
give this type of garbage connection as

---------11:11----------
somebody who pays them $450 a month call

---------11:14----------
spectrum tell them rossmann or pair

---------11:16----------
group at 186 first Avenue has been

---------11:18----------
paying you over $400 a month like three

---------11:21----------
[ __ ] years now and his connection

---------11:23----------
still sucks and I can't watch your

---------11:25----------
stream so I would do is I would tell

---------11:29----------
spectrum to fix my [ __ ] internet but

---------11:34----------
that's never gonna happen because the

---------11:35----------
spectrum alright so that being said

---------11:38----------
that's oh these are the duck-billed

---------11:41----------
tweezers again I can't use those for

---------11:42----------
anything

---------11:46----------
okay

---------12:26----------
okay

---------12:31----------
it looks like I may be missing the pp3

---------12:33----------
before - via over here let's dig a

---------12:39----------
little bit I might actually be able to

---------12:43----------
scrape it away from right next to door

---------12:48----------
how can I help you

---------12:50----------
oh this it's just green green blue blue

---------12:55----------
yellow yeah I had a little marker on

---------12:59----------
each of them but it was the the washable

---------13:01----------
marker yep the hall sensor is not but

---------13:08----------
the normal phase wires are

---------13:33----------
I destroyed the wire as well as the

---------13:35----------
motor that's awesome

---------13:45----------
all right so I think I've created enough

---------13:47----------
in there to this solder to see

---------14:00----------
whenever you think something's gone you

---------14:02----------
can actually make it reappear with an

---------14:03----------
exacto sometimes and just digging a

---------14:05----------
little I think that was one of my

---------14:07----------
biggest red pill moments when it came to

---------14:09----------
border para going how do they do that

---------14:11----------
there's no more pad Sean sighs stick one

---------14:14----------
of the spectrum supervisors on your

---------14:15----------
connection they've solved chronic issues

---------14:17----------
Mian hours it doesn't matter it doesn't

---------14:19----------
matter they'll fix it and then the next

---------14:21----------
day it'll just be [ __ ] up again the

---------14:22----------
solution is to move to a store that

---------14:24----------
doesn't have spectrum and the new store

---------14:25----------
has files that's gonna be great

---------14:27----------
I could stream in 28 megabit per second

---------14:30----------
or four I could stream in the [ __ ]

---------14:31----------
recording bitrate if I wanted to I got

---------14:33----------
gigabit it's gonna be awesome sometimes

---------14:36----------
at home just for the hell of it just for

---------14:38----------
just reflexing purposes I tried

---------14:39----------
streaming at 20 or 30 megabit per second

---------14:41----------
and it just works it's beautiful it's

---------14:44----------
beautiful I mean there's no point to

---------14:48----------
doing it but it's just like I can so I'm

---------14:50----------
going to because I can't hello Paul

---------14:58----------
pretty

---------15:05----------
connected which the hall sensor thing

---------15:07----------
it's so annoying yeah I push in and then

---------15:13----------
I silicone the crap out of it so that I

---------15:15----------
would never move again but I didn't

---------15:17----------
realize that there would be maintenance

---------15:23----------
how do you know which one is which color

---------15:26----------
this one's still green this one's yellow

---------15:29----------
why did the green is the only one that

---------15:31----------
survived this is so pretty

---------15:37----------
eventually I'm gonna have to get some

---------15:39----------
quarter-twenty bolts for the metal

---------15:40----------
string but it's surviving very well with

---------15:43----------
only two oh my god oh [ __ ] how did my

---------15:51----------
battery even put out enough power to do

---------15:53----------
this the casing burned up smells good I

---------15:57----------
don't even have the casing on the other

---------15:59----------
one

---------16:15----------
all right what do I have to do here ah

---------16:17----------
yes get my donor board what are the

---------16:24----------
chances of a donor board having you 1950

---------16:26----------
on it the first one I pulled out of the

---------16:32----------
slot out of you 1950 god damn that's

---------16:36----------
sexy

---------16:43----------
you should try please brewing spectrum

---------16:46----------
that requires being on the phone and on

---------16:48----------
hold for a very long time which is time

---------16:51----------
that means no board repair which means

---------16:52----------
no making money which means no moving

---------16:55----------
very bad must fix boards but

---------17:07----------
one second can't hear you

---------17:16----------
that's that's floating above the pads

---------17:18----------
which is no good I got to push it down

---------17:20----------
because when you grab it with the

---------17:21----------
tweezers if you grab it too low on the

---------17:23----------
chip it did you just did you just did

---------17:29----------
you really just nothing wait no way no

---------17:32----------
way no way

---------17:35----------
you didn't just fly away

---------17:53----------
and now I got to figure out which side

---------17:55----------
is which

---------18:08----------
now you may notice that there's a

---------18:09----------
disconnect and the PPP before it to

---------18:11----------
underscore g3 hot raise above

---------18:21----------
I don't know what m12 is I'm sorry I

---------18:23----------
know I'm a noob I apologize for being a

---------18:26----------
noob but I don't know what that means

---------18:28----------
one of the most difficult things I've

---------18:30----------
realized while I was trying to put

---------18:31----------
together the bike is like I know what I

---------18:35----------
know what I want I don't know what it's

---------18:36----------
called and I won't be able to say what I

---------18:39----------
need so for example like when I needed

---------18:42----------
to make the Hall sensor wire from the

---------18:44----------
Sabaton controller to the BBS HD I

---------18:47----------
needed the connector in the plug but I

---------18:49----------
know what it looks like but what the

---------18:51----------
[ __ ] is this called and it's a jst

---------18:53----------
connector and then everybody kept saying

---------18:54----------
oh yes just the jst and I said ok that's

---------18:56----------
what I need so then I asked for and then

---------18:58----------
I look like a dumbass because jst is a

---------19:00----------
brand not a connector it's not like it's

---------19:03----------
not like I'm saying the exact thing I

---------19:05----------
want so I wound up having to buy every

---------19:07----------
single one of them to find the one that

---------19:09----------
fits in the worst part is I forgot the

---------19:11----------
damn name of it so now if I had to

---------19:13----------
answer that again I couldn't but that's

---------19:15----------
what my order history is for but yes I

---------19:18----------
honestly don't know what that is I'm

---------19:19----------
sorry I'm a noob and the other thing is

---------19:21----------
not really knowing where to learn that

---------19:23----------
stuff

---------19:29----------
so I'm gonna put a wire here just to

---------19:31----------
make sure that the pp 3 before 2 makes

---------19:33----------
its way

---------19:40----------
to the ship

---------20:04----------
m12 12 millimeter 0.472 inches in

---------20:08----------
freedom unit okay so that's a unit of

---------20:12----------
measurement but I still don't understand

---------20:14----------
- what the question wasn't afraid I'm

---------20:16----------
sorry doesn't change my tip my numbness

---------20:20----------
at all okay so now we are going to move

---------20:25----------
this hot air it into place nicely so I

---------20:37----------
want my jumper to be where it's

---------20:38----------
comfortable

---------20:39----------
not just where I put it I want it to

---------20:41----------
actually flow to where it would be

---------20:42----------
comfortable because that's where it's

---------20:48----------
gonna be the most stable long term now I

---------20:52----------
want this to be able to survive getting

---------20:53----------
dropped all sorts of things I want this

---------20:57----------
to survive all the abuse that I should

---------20:59----------
expect a Mac owner to inflict on their

---------21:01----------
product this is rapid cool it for a

---------21:03----------
second get it by a breeze

---------21:16----------
all right we're getting six hundred

---------21:17----------
milliamps which should mean we getting

---------21:19----------
fans been soon now keep in mind this is

---------21:21----------
an eight to zero 49 24 not an eight to

---------21:23----------
zero 35 36 or eight to zero 34 seventy

---------21:26----------
six that means that the fan is not going

---------21:27----------
to spin on this until it's about twenty

---------21:29----------
degrees Celsius higher than the older

---------21:33----------
machine so Apple had a design that

---------21:36----------
actually wasn't overheating it's rare

---------21:37----------
for Apple but it was you know running at

---------21:39----------
a somewhat reasonable temperature and

---------21:40----------
they decided to well what we can't have

---------21:43----------
that so the things on right now you may

---------21:46----------
not believe me but it is and you're

---------21:48----------
gonna see that it's gonna take about a

---------21:50----------
minute or two for this fan to come on

---------21:51----------
even as this heatsink burns because

---------21:55----------
Apple so let's just give it a minute

---------21:58----------
that's a nice one heatsink all right the

---------22:01----------
fan really doesn't seem to want to spin

---------22:03----------
on this so now that that's worrying me

---------22:05----------
because even by Apple's cooling

---------22:07----------
standards that should have started

---------22:08----------
spinning so let's see if this thing is

---------22:10----------
capable of booting into an operating

---------22:11----------
system maybe they just updated the

---------22:14----------
firmware or something and made it even

---------22:16----------
run even more warm I know there was

---------22:20----------
recently an update with Catalina where I

---------22:23----------
was updating the firmware and there was

---------22:24----------
some 32 64 bit kind of issue and it was

---------22:27----------
it was killing a lot of them so that

---------22:29----------
that's that's some pretty interesting

---------22:30----------
firmware updates that I applied going on

---------22:32----------
for this model but for glitch to see

---------22:34----------
what I get on the screen see if this

---------22:36----------
thing is brain-dead and I'm good and we

---------22:41----------
have an Apple logo there beautiful

---------22:46----------
I don't have the webcam plugged in so

---------22:50----------
it's not doing the ambient light sensing

---------22:52----------
or it sees that it's a really bright

---------22:53----------
environment and turning the screen up I

---------22:55----------
don't have the ambient light sensor

---------22:56----------
plugged in so it's stuck on the last

---------22:58----------
brightness and again I have a lot of

---------22:59----------
lighting in this office so that you can

---------23:01----------
see all the wrinkles and contortions in

---------23:03----------
my aging face as well as you be able to

---------23:06----------
see all the corrosion on the board and

---------23:07----------
without the webcam plugged in it's it's

---------23:09----------
booting to the low brightness because

---------23:12----------
inside the webcam is the automated light

---------23:13----------
sensor so we did to this machine to make

---------23:15----------
it work again first thing we did is we

---------23:17----------
plugged it in and we realized recognized

---------23:20----------
that there was a problem with p.m. sleep

---------23:24----------
best ferrell missing before I even took

---------23:26----------
out the board or off my multimeter by

---------23:28----------
seeing how much power the board's using

---------23:29----------
that is an excellent diagnostic shortcut

---------23:33----------
how many amps azar taking and if you

---------23:36----------
can't remember it that's fine write down

---------23:37----------
a table every time you have a problem

---------23:39----------
this is how many amps it was taking

---------23:40----------
without the battery plugged in and this

---------23:41----------
was my problem so that you can associate

---------23:43----------
it and then in the future you save time

---------23:45----------
and troubleshoot that was done beautiful

---------23:48----------
great then we figured out that that was

---------23:50----------
was actually missing we looked around

---------23:51----------
the board at the typical culprits for a

---------23:53----------
missing p.m. sleep s4l clock not there

---------23:55----------
short-circuit not there you 1950 ow

---------23:57----------
burned destroyed replaced there's a

---------24:00----------
little bit of other corrosion on the

---------24:02----------
board that's unrelated that's only if I

---------24:03----------
want to program it to the jtag connector

---------24:04----------
which I don't necessarily care about

---------24:06----------
because I don't have access to the tool

---------24:08----------
to do that

---------24:08----------
so I'm gonna clean up that corrosion a

---------24:11----------
little bit this thing go get ultrasonics

---------24:12----------
reassembled test it and it'll go back to

---------24:14----------
a happy customer that otherwise probably

---------24:16----------
would have been bent over the bar by

---------24:17----------
Apple you know that's it for today and

---------24:20----------
as always I hope you learned something

---------24:22----------
thank you so much for watching thank you

---------24:24----------
so much for taking part in what we do

---------24:25----------
here and I will see you all in the next
