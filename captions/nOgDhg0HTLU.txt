---------00:00----------
all righty so today we're gonna be going

---------00:01----------
over an 8 to 0 29:36 board it has no

---------00:04----------
backlight now let's take a look and try

---------00:07----------
to figure out why this has no backlight

---------00:09----------
that is with the repair shop sent this

---------00:11----------
in for and when you look around here

---------00:14----------
what do you know

---------00:15----------
it looks like my technicians 2 year old

---------00:17----------
daughter tried to solder an LCD Kinect

---------00:19----------
isn't isn't this cute

---------00:22----------
really this isn't this isn't this cute

---------00:27----------
oh why why why why why ok so first

---------00:38----------
things first is we're just gonna take

---------00:39----------
that and remove it because that is

---------00:40----------
disgusting and also you're gonna see

---------00:43----------
here the other thing wrong with this is

---------00:44----------
that this is an a20 29:36 motherboard

---------00:46----------
which means that it should not have that

---------00:48----------
connector on it should have a different

---------00:50----------
one so if this had any chance see you

---------00:53----------
later this had any chance of having a

---------00:55----------
backlight even with this this up

---------00:58----------
looking connector it certainly is not

---------01:00----------
going to have anything on it when you

---------01:02----------
plug in the improper LCD cable there's a

---------01:04----------
pretty good chance that it won't stay in

---------01:06----------
but it's cute that they tried now isn't

---------01:10----------
it ok so first things first hot air

---------01:14----------
remove this this come on

---------01:26----------
good get the out of here ok we run

---------01:35----------
some nice oh my irons not hot yet it

---------01:40----------
hasn't beeped there we go it beeped

---------01:47----------
you know what's really cool is where my

---------01:49----------
head is over here actually blocked a

---------01:51----------
screw up I just made so you can't see it

---------01:54----------
that's pretty cool I wasn't even

---------01:56----------
planning for that yeah I moved to

---------02:00----------
capacitor out of place and my head was

---------02:02----------
actually blocking it okay

---------02:05----------
so let's fix this nonsense all right so

---------02:14----------
first things first is to get rid of the

---------02:16----------
old nasty solder unfortunately I don't

---------02:19----------
have the wick that I'm

---------02:22----------
unfortunately I don't have the wick that

---------02:24----------
I'm used to I have this garbage junk

---------02:25----------
while I wait for my gouta wick to get

---------02:27----------
here so let's see how how miserable

---------02:29----------
that's going to make the process over

---------02:31----------
what it should be I don't like when the

---------02:35----------
process is made miserable by tools that

---------02:36----------
don't do their job I don't know where

---------02:39----------
this stuff came from really it's it's

---------02:42----------
it's just solder away exciting remover

---------02:44----------
it's this blue labeled junk it's not

---------02:52----------
like a liquid where like they say it's

---------02:53----------
blue label so you're getting something

---------02:54----------
good this is this is just like

---------02:58----------
this is yeah it's it's crap all right I

---------03:02----------
wish I had a remote over here to turn

---------03:04----------
the camera off of facial recognition and

---------03:08----------
just a regular autofocus that would be

---------03:10----------
pretty cool but I think I'm asking too

---------03:12----------
much

---------03:17----------
all righty and we move on to there and

---------03:21----------
get rid of all this junk of course as

---------03:25----------
usual it is good to have a fume

---------03:26----------
extractor I don't want to breed any of

---------03:28----------
that in breathing that in is really

---------03:31----------
frowned upon so there been some comments

---------03:34----------
on my youtube videos about our metal you

---------03:36----------
know the body actually does have a way

---------03:38----------
of getting rid of metals and all these

---------03:39----------
little gases and things that are inside

---------03:41----------
of the flux and the solder that I'm

---------03:43----------
working with you know what

---------03:45----------
I'll just take your word for each I'm

---------03:47----------
not gonna test that I'm not gonna find

---------03:50----------
out no thank you

---------03:51----------
nice try this is some really bad work

---------04:02----------
like I'm not gonna be able to get that

---------04:04----------
as clean as I want it to be and look I

---------04:06----------
knocked that same capacitor off again

---------04:08----------
what do I have against that they keep

---------04:11----------
knocking it off for no reason yeah get

---------04:15----------
over here

---------04:31----------
all of this nonsense is gonna have to

---------04:33----------
get cleaned because it's gross

---------04:51----------
alcohol and my little clean room wiper

---------04:53----------
are going to be for clean room wipers

---------04:58----------
are really good for this because they

---------04:59----------
don't leave behind as much junk

---------05:01----------
they don't leave behind any junk which I

---------05:03----------
love you can see all the nasty spots in

---------05:06----------
my microscope that seen some seen some

---------05:11----------
beating we're getting moved back and

---------05:13----------
forth so I don't have any picture there

---------05:15----------
you could see this there's junk like

---------05:18----------
over here and there what are you gonna

---------05:22----------
do yeah good enough for what we're doing

---------05:26----------
here so we're gonna take some flux but

---------05:30----------
the flux over the pads here it's way too

---------05:34----------
much because I wasn't paying attention

---------05:36----------
for a second but who really cares not me

---------05:42----------
take the connector this is one of the

---------05:48----------
ones where it doesn't stick into the

---------05:50----------
board through the holes which sucks it's

---------05:52----------
more work for me there's nothing good

---------05:56----------
about more work for me

---------06:04----------
yeah you can't see a damn thing

---------06:07----------
doesn't really matter because it's gonna

---------06:08----------
move around so much as I put this down

---------06:10----------
anyway it really doesn't matter

---------06:13----------
I guess sooner they touch my tweezers to

---------06:16----------
that it's gonna move alright so you

---------06:22----------
press it down really hard I got the flux

---------06:23----------
over there and I connect it now the

---------06:26----------
whole thing the whole thing that's going

---------06:27----------
on here is that you I can't add solder

---------06:31----------
to the I can't add solder with you know

---------06:35----------
one hand while I'm putting the iron

---------06:38----------
there with the other because I need to

---------06:39----------
hold the connector down so what I'm

---------06:40----------
doing here is I flux there so that I

---------06:43----------
don't have to be adding new side or I

---------06:45----------
can just use this nasty cruddy solder

---------06:47----------
with all the flux melted away that I

---------06:48----------
have on the edge of my iron without

---------06:52----------
having to worry about it not flowing

---------06:54----------
properly alright so this I believe is a

---------06:57----------
case of you're not aligning it as well

---------07:00----------
as I should have

---------07:03----------
boo-yeah it always moves this really it

---------07:08----------
always moves okay we can correct that

---------07:11----------
luckily okay

---------07:20----------
so I move it over a little bit

---------08:06----------
this is what kills me about this - I

---------08:08----------
mean you can tell from this video just

---------08:09----------
how badly I suck at this so I mean like

---------08:12----------
when I see stuff where it's just getting

---------08:14----------
totally destroyed and butchered and the

---------08:16----------
pins aren't even there that makes me sad

---------08:17----------
because it's like I'm not even good at

---------08:19----------
this and I'm getting the job done you

---------08:23----------
know it's like why oh really it's one

---------08:25----------
thing if I'm like this jackass about

---------08:27----------
connector soldering and I'm you know I'm

---------08:30----------
the world's best at it and I have this

---------08:32----------
great amazing skill set but I suck at

---------08:35----------
this I mean really I do

---------08:36----------
really I am NOT a connector solder er

---------08:38----------
this is not my thing I hate it I'm bad

---------08:40----------
at it and still saw that that's why I've

---------08:43----------
you know it kills me when I see the JIT

---------08:45----------
the junk it gets down to these because

---------08:49----------
like I'm this is I'm just so bad at it

---------08:53----------
it's hard for me to stomach seeing you

---------08:58----------
and worse

---------09:23----------
you can secure that more later but for

---------09:25----------
now that is totally fine well you

---------09:29----------
changed tips over to the little curve D

---------09:30----------
tip so I can do my cheating job as I

---------09:33----------
like to explain as an adult one of the

---------09:35----------
great things about life is that nobody

---------09:36----------
cares how you get the job done

---------09:37----------
if you don't harm anybody and it works

---------09:40----------
so you don't have to watch what I'm

---------09:42----------
gonna do here I had even more fluxed you

---------09:45----------
can I don't care about because this the

---------09:46----------
sport is gonna get cleaned I don't care

---------09:47----------
I don't really feel like changing the

---------09:49----------
tip on this dispenser just so that it

---------09:51----------
puts out the right amount of flux this

---------09:52----------
is totally completely going to be clean

---------09:55----------
the ultrasonics and brushed away so I

---------09:57----------
don't care I really don't they're never

---------10:00----------
gonna see I guess unless they watch my

---------10:02----------
video but let's face it if you're

---------10:06----------
watching this video probably here cuz

---------10:09----------
you don't know how to do it and I don't

---------10:10----------
really care what you think of you know

---------10:12----------
the amount of flux that I dispense

---------10:14----------
anyway alright so see that we're just

---------10:18----------
gonna go

---------10:30----------
and there we go you see you see that

---------10:32----------
like I don't know if it was as in focus

---------10:35----------
with the there as it was in my eye

---------10:36----------
pieces but like that that's that's

---------10:39----------
really all you got to it and you see

---------10:47----------
that there's no reason for that

---------10:49----------
[ __ ] that you saw over there

---------10:51----------
really is and it's like to do this job

---------10:53----------
that's just slippity slide and again

---------10:59----------
keep in mind I'm not good at this I mean

---------11:00----------
Micro I'm not a micro solder I

---------11:03----------
don't identify I identify as a

---------11:06----------
electronics repair person I am NOT a

---------11:09----------
micro soldering person I am terrible at

---------11:13----------
all this this like small stuff that you

---------11:15----------
can't see

---------11:17----------
so I find ways to make my life easy so

---------11:21----------
that I can do the work that I would

---------11:23----------
otherwise not be able to so I really I

---------11:26----------
want to be able to micro solder to the

---------11:27----------
ability to do my job

---------11:30----------
that's it and I don't you know I'm not

---------11:32----------
trying to do this like to be the best

---------11:36----------
Microsoft or I see this as a part of my

---------11:37----------
job that I'm stuck doing if I want to be

---------11:40----------
able to repair things so I try to come

---------11:43----------
up with these little ways of making my

---------11:45----------
life easy I try to look up ways of

---------11:47----------
making my life easy and that little that

---------11:49----------
the whole thing I show you right there

---------11:50----------
it may help us make my life easy and you

---------11:53----------
you see like my hands are garbage I

---------11:55----------
can't even I can't position a connector

---------11:57----------
I can't hold the damn thing in place

---------11:58----------
more than a second but still even

---------12:01----------
considering how bad my skill set is when

---------12:04----------
it comes to just being able to hold

---------12:05----------
something straight

---------12:06----------
I'm still able to solder that connector

---------12:08----------
in a matter of seconds once it's placed

---------12:11----------
on there using this method which is

---------12:15----------
pretty cool yeah there's a little

---------12:17----------
capacitor that what's not there that's

---------12:19----------
supposed to be that we're going to put

---------12:20----------
on

---------12:27----------
it's not critical by any means but it

---------12:30----------
was there before it should be there when

---------12:31----------
we're done

---------13:06----------
okay now to remove this river massive

---------13:15----------
junk

---------13:16----------
since my use my last clean room wipe I

---------13:19----------
don't feel like getting up until I get a

---------13:20----------
wireless microphone set up I will use a

---------13:23----------
q-tip because the q-tip is on my table

---------13:26----------
and as I explain in a lot of these other

---------13:27----------
videos you know the most important tool

---------13:30----------
is not the tool that you love it's not

---------13:32----------
the tool that is it's not the tool that

---------13:34----------
everybody else is it's right it's a tool

---------13:36----------
that's like right in front of you if it

---------13:38----------
works if it does the job this is nothing

---------13:42----------
that drives me nuts when people say you

---------13:44----------
know I need what do I order for master

---------13:46----------
com2 start fixing boards with you mean

---------13:48----------
bow sir you your first assignment is

---------13:52----------
going to be to go out there and buy the

---------13:55----------
dead motherboards that that are you know

---------13:58----------
15 a 30 bucks apiece that have every

---------14:01----------
piece on them that you need so that you

---------14:03----------
don't have to wait people don't feel

---------14:06----------
like waiting a week for you to get

---------14:07----------
something to confirm a diagnosis what

---------14:11----------
are you kidding me what you know you're

---------14:15----------
not gonna be going to Mouser comm every

---------14:17----------
time you want to prove a theory your

---------14:19----------
nods just not the way it is

---------14:34----------
push-to-connect it down on this end

---------14:49----------
it's already pushed down on that end

---------14:51----------
okay now we go through the pin test I'm

---------14:57----------
not just interested in plugging it in to

---------14:58----------
see if it works I want to make sure

---------14:59----------
every single one of those pins is put in

---------15:00----------
place where it's supposed to be and it's

---------15:06----------
not like I uniquely soldered each one I

---------15:08----------
just used the quality flux and I just

---------15:11----------
dragged it along while putting a little

---------15:14----------
bit of pressure barely any pressure like

---------15:16----------
almost none but just enough to it would

---------15:19----------
actually get off the iron so we're gonna

---------15:21----------
do is a 30 X go over each one see that

---------15:26----------
it actually worked

---------15:27----------
that's pin this is obviously not needed

---------15:31----------
that's anymore light some reason the

---------15:36----------
camera doesn't pick up as much light

---------15:37----------
with it then is this does count

---------15:52----------
pin 1 pin 2 & 3 are tied together which

---------15:54----------
is why I have a side of love there and 4

---------15:59----------
5 6 so I'm doing is I'm pushing it hard

---------16:03----------
enough that I want to try to break the

---------16:04----------
joint

---------16:06----------
thank you for blinking you should image

---------16:09----------
what dongle does that in Windows and

---------16:11----------
Linux by the way well the company makes

---------16:16----------
this crap you've captured hardware the

---------16:18----------
mage well okay see that that is then

---------16:23----------
whatever that is a casualty of whoever

---------16:27----------
tried to do this before so let's hope

---------16:30----------
that that is not connected so

---------16:32----------
that's pin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13

---------16:37----------
14 is kind of up but at the very

---------16:41----------
least it's still there

---------16:42----------
pin 13 so we're gonna see what pin 13 is

---------16:45----------
before we tell these people that there's

---------16:47----------
not much I can do like oh I'll do some

---------16:55----------
work on you know boards that are

---------16:57----------
naturally damaged like that but I'm not

---------16:59----------
running wires it's around the whole

---------17:01----------
thing for stuff that somebody else

---------17:02----------
 up on their own that's when you

---------17:06----------
are on your own I don't waste time on

---------17:09----------
do-it-yourself misses okay so 13 is

---------17:12----------
ground according to the schematic okay

---------17:16----------
so let's move on here okay

---------17:32----------
yeah that's who cares that's

---------17:34----------
still attached that barely working

---------17:36----------
traced its 14 it's 1516 this is soldered

---------17:41----------
17 a soldered 18 is soldered 19 no

---------17:44----------
soldered 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29

---------17:54----------
30 I will get that hair was gonna come

---------17:57----------
off after it gets toothbrush tanned

---------17:58----------
tossed in the ultrasonic cleaner so I

---------18:01----------
don't really care too much for this now

---------18:04----------
okay

---------18:06----------
now let's check everything else not

---------18:09----------
something that I'm interested in before

---------18:12----------
I bother turning this on I want to see

---------18:14----------
if even worth trying to turn on if it's

---------18:16----------
actually gonna work

---------18:17----------
let's put my multimeter in diode mode

---------18:27----------
you can't see it at this camera angle

---------18:38----------
okay there's multimeter here I'll

---------18:45----------
shorten myself get that on diode mode so

---------18:52----------
first things first let's check this

---------18:54----------
backlight fuse

---------19:10----------
it's not blown okay now we check the

---------19:15----------
actual backlight circuit how much of

---------19:17----------
this is gonna work okay yeah this is

---------19:20----------
this is not giving me much hope so let's

---------19:23----------
see so we go from here

---------19:24----------
here we should get 0.5 to 10.5 for 4 you

---------19:30----------
have 0.53 one well now we have 0.5 to 9

---------19:36----------
that's good enough now it's time to plug

---------19:41----------
this panel in and see if it stands a

---------19:42----------
chance at actually working wired

---------19:54----------
microphone is driving me nuts I'm

---------19:57----------
starting to get spoiled the sound in

---------20:01----------
these videos just one year ago is such a

---------20:03----------
complete crap now it's a lot better but

---------20:05----------
I'm just tired of having a wired

---------20:07----------
microphone but I also don't want to

---------20:13----------
spend money on a wireless microphone

---------20:17----------
okay

---------20:49----------
I'm interested in here as a light this

---------20:52----------
was sent in with the sole report being

---------20:53----------
no light I'm fairly certain that it's

---------20:57----------
gonna run slow every now and then

---------20:59----------
because of the how that hot side current

---------21:00----------
sensing it looks but for the time being

---------21:02----------
glitch to see we can do with the light

---------21:04----------
oh this LCD cable is so charges

---------21:10----------
probably from trying to fit it into it

---------21:13----------
2012 connector

---------21:15----------
okay so weak this this is the one good

---------21:25----------
thing that I like about the

---------21:26----------
business-to-business end now you see a

---------21:29----------
good that that other stuff that's not my

---------21:32----------
problem

---------21:46----------
case

---------21:56----------
let me show you what I'm talking about

---------22:03----------
what a mess this desk is right I hate

---------22:14----------
the wired microphone all right you see

---------22:20----------
that chewed up at the end here now

---------22:23----------
this this is not how this is supposed to

---------22:26----------
look see that and it's keeping it from

---------22:29----------
going in properly and of course there is

---------22:31----------
no light on the screen so I would do a

---------22:39----------
couple of measurements here voltage mode

---------22:45----------
we're going to check the backlight

---------22:47----------
enable pin of the LED driver it should

---------22:52----------
be 3 volts 3 volts we're gonna check

---------22:55----------
what's actually going to the backlight

---------22:57----------
24 volts what's this pin of the

---------23:03----------
connector 24 volts okay we're going to

---------23:06----------
check for the PWM signal

---------23:20----------
should see a square wave back there on

---------23:22----------
the oscilloscope in a second or so

---------23:30----------
that's

---------23:45----------
everything's there for backlight which

---------23:47----------
means that at LCD or that LCD cable are

---------23:51----------
 I'm tripping over at least five

---------23:57----------
wires right now mother let's put this in

---------24:03----------
my pocket make life a little easier okay

---------24:06----------
so let's try an LCD in an LCD cable that

---------24:11----------
aren't to and see what

---------24:14----------
happens shall we this flimsy ass

---------24:24----------
microphone this is what you get for 50

---------24:26----------
bucks really every time I move the

---------24:28----------
 thing moves and it hits me in

---------24:30----------
the mouth

---------24:31----------
alright yeah I can't complain that I

---------24:35----------
bought cheap and I what I what I got

---------24:38----------
there is what I paid for so I paid for

---------24:41----------
it cheap cheap as microphone I got it

---------24:44----------
cheap ass microphone now I'm complaining

---------24:46----------
about it it really makes no sense you

---------24:52----------
can't buy junk and then complain when

---------24:53----------
it's junk

---------24:54----------
alright so now we're trying with a new

---------24:57----------
LCD and if this works again one of the

---------25:00----------
benefits of the whole wholesale client

---------25:01----------
relationship is my job is done this was

---------25:05----------
sent in for board repair unfortunately

---------25:12----------
it doesn't now 24 volts there I had a

---------25:16----------
feeling that this model needs 27 though

---------25:18----------
call me nuts but I think it does its

---------25:22----------
thing it's like virtually you get the

---------25:23----------
voltage is there so I'm gonna take one

---------25:26----------
wild guess on one crazy guess is that

---------25:30----------
that nasty nasty looking LED driver area

---------25:33----------
means that the LED driver also needs

---------25:34----------
replacing as well alright so even though

---------25:39----------
the number that I got on outputted

---------25:41----------
backlight is correct as you could see I

---------25:43----------
had a at the number that I said I should

---------25:45----------
get on the meter

---------25:46----------
that's not foolproof that's just one one

---------25:49----------
out of many ways of troubleshooting a

---------25:51----------
problem alright so let's get some of

---------25:55----------
this stuff off of my table I have a

---------25:57----------
terrible habit of letting

---------25:58----------
table turn into a complete mess very

---------26:00----------
quickly something about New York and

---------26:02----------
working in all these small spaces you

---------26:12----------
don't get space for anything in New York

---------26:13----------
City okay

---------26:18----------
let's replace the LED driver even though

---------26:21----------
my measurement said it's good

---------26:32----------
you

---------27:09----------
hmm

---------28:14----------
it's impossible to move in here

---------29:12----------
my LCD cable plugs in very nicely

---------29:15----------
because it wasn't destroyed instant

---------29:27----------
light done so what did we learn today

---------29:33----------
first things first do not let a

---------29:34----------
two-year-old solder an LCD connector

---------29:36----------
onto a motherboard secondly if you have

---------29:38----------
a two year old solder the wrong LCD

---------29:40----------
connector onto your motherboard do not

---------29:42----------
keep jamming the incorrect cable into it

---------29:44----------
hoping that will eventually fit because

---------29:45----------
you will destroy the cable and thirdly

---------29:48----------
it is very very simple even if you are

---------29:50----------
bad at micro saturon even if you cannot

---------29:52----------
hold your hand steady to save your life

---------29:54----------
to do a very very simple easy job just

---------29:57----------
use good flux I use this amp tech 559

---------30:01----------
right here with is one of these great

---------30:02----------
syringes that one of my actually YouTube

---------30:04----------
subscribers sent to me so thank you very

---------30:05----------
much the person who sent this and make

---------30:08----------
again it makes life easy it's like zing

---------30:10----------
and you're done and apparently we also

---------30:13----------
learned that one of my methods of

---------30:14----------
troubleshooting circuits is actually not

---------30:16----------
always good so I like to use diode while

---------30:18----------
measurements to ground and every single

---------30:19----------
pin to give me an idea if any pathway

---------30:21----------
inside the actual circuit doesn't work

---------30:23----------
and that was within the back light

---------30:25----------
circuit was within the specified

---------30:26----------
parameters that I usually have and it

---------30:28----------
still didn't work the way it was

---------30:30----------
supposed to which means that I am NOT

---------30:31----------
always right and hey again it just goes

---------30:34----------
to show that a lot of this is guesswork

---------30:35----------
a lot of this is stuff where we have to

---------30:38----------
come up with their own funky ways of

---------30:40----------
figuring out and troubleshooting this so

---------30:42----------
that it can be done within a 10 to 30

---------30:44----------
minute time frame if you try to do this

---------30:45----------
without having some types of tricks that

---------30:48----------
you came up with not tricks like magic

---------30:50----------
you read in the book that's like here's

---------30:51----------
how you fix a board I mean using your

---------30:52----------
brain I mean if you haven't come up with

---------30:53----------
any shortcuts using your brain to figure

---------30:55----------
out what's going on in a circuit and

---------30:57----------
well then you're gonna be spending hours

---------31:00----------
upon hours on this and let me tell you

---------31:01----------
something again these boards like they

---------31:03----------
cost three to five hundred dollars well

---------31:05----------
some of them are like seven or eight

---------31:06----------
hundred on the high end it's not worth

---------31:08----------
hours upon hours upon hours of a

---------31:11----------
technicians time to troubleshoot it you

---------31:12----------
really have to get some tricks in place

---------31:14----------
so that you can do your job in ten to

---------31:17----------
twenty minutes again as I like to say if

---------31:19----------
it takes me more than twenty or thirty

---------31:20----------
minutes to a board

---------31:22----------
me it just becomes trash it's not it's

---------31:24----------
not where the time so come up with some

---------31:26----------
ways and hopefully you come up with some

---------31:27----------
ways that are even better than mine to

---------31:30----------
figure this problem out so again over

---------31:31----------
there the old LED driver was outputting

---------31:33----------
only up to 24 volts instead of 27 and

---------31:35----------
nothing in my diode load measurement on

---------31:37----------
the output of backlight gave me a

---------31:39----------
measurement that's in line with what I

---------31:40----------
expect from a working chip so my

---------31:43----------
troubleshooting method there that I've

---------31:44----------
talked about in other videos and I've

---------31:45----------
shown you in other videos when the

---------31:46----------
feedback via is blown so you got to come

---------31:49----------
up with your own smart ways of doing it

---------31:50----------
and again hopefully if you have half a

---------31:52----------
brain you come up with a lot smarter

---------31:53----------
things than I've shown you here
