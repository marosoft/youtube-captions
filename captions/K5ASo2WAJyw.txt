---------00:00----------
hi today I'm going to be working on a

---------00:01----------
board for somebody who tried to replace

---------00:03----------
their own hard drive and as a result of

---------00:04----------
trying to replace their own hard drive

---------00:05----------
the machine is dead one of the things

---------00:08----------
that I like to talk about with labor

---------00:09----------
rates in general is when you set labor

---------00:12----------
rates set it according to the dumbest

---------00:15----------
thing you've ever had an employee do and

---------00:17----------
you'll notice that you have a lot less

---------00:19----------
guilt in terms of setting labor rates

---------00:20----------
for things that you find simple so you

---------00:22----------
know there are a lot of things where

---------00:23----------
people will do it for free you're on the

---------00:25----------
house because they find that it's just

---------00:27----------
such an easy thing to do but even in

---------00:30----------
again just think of this like this

---------00:32----------
person tried to replace a hard drive and

---------00:33----------
they're not I'm not saying they're dumb

---------00:34----------
they didn't seem dumb when they came in

---------00:36----------
but this is supposed to be the simplest

---------00:38----------
thing to do inside of a laptop computer

---------00:40----------
and while doing this seemingly easy task

---------00:44----------
which I'm not going to sit here and say

---------00:46----------
is difficult this is easy as I

---------00:48----------
would tell my own my own sixty

---------00:49----------
six-year-old dad that you can do this

---------00:51----------
yourself you don't need me for it the

---------00:53----------
board died and you know it's just one of

---------00:56----------
those things where it's you know I don't

---------00:59----------
feel bad that that things cost money

---------01:00----------
I'll always tell people when something

---------01:02----------
is very very simple and easy and you

---------01:05----------
know for the love of God please don't

---------01:06----------
pay me for it but when I accept money

---------01:08----------
for things it's like this is why so

---------01:11----------
we're going to do here is we're going to

---------01:13----------
start measuring around to see why this

---------01:14----------
is dead this is an eight to zero 3115

---------01:18----------
board so the first thing that I should

---------01:21----------
have here is 12 volts on P P buzz g3 hot

---------01:26----------
and that is 12 volts the second thing

---------01:29----------
that we should have is pp 3 v 4 2 at

---------01:31----------
3.42 volts and we have that third thing

---------01:34----------
we should have is pp 5vs5 at 5 volts and

---------01:38----------
we have that the fourth thing we should

---------01:41----------
have is pp 5 vs 3 at 5 volts and we

---------01:46----------
don't have ok so look now we get to

---------01:49----------
hunt and figure out why we don't have pp

---------01:52----------
5 V s 3

---------02:04----------
the first thing I'm going to do is

---------02:06----------
unplug this person's drive cable next

---------02:13----------
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

---------02:15----------
remove a chip that is responsible for

---------02:17----------
sending the end trip signal so to give

---------02:19----------
you an idea of what the end trip signal

---------02:21----------
is and what I'm talking about here so as

---------02:23----------
I said in one of the other videos and

---------02:25----------
what is an enable signal and how does an

---------02:27----------
integrated circuit work a lot of chips

---------02:29----------
that are responsible for there we go so

---------02:33----------
a lot of chips that are responsible for

---------02:35----------
power rails in a machine have something

---------02:38----------
called an enable pin or an end trip

---------02:39----------
circuit so it's not going to actually

---------02:41----------
start the power supply working until it

---------02:45----------
sees that there's power at the enable

---------02:47----------
pin the way this works is the opposite

---------02:50----------
once it will be off if you send the end

---------02:54----------
trip signal to ground and being trolled

---------02:58----------
here here we go

---------03:04----------
it'll be off if you send any trip to

---------03:05----------
ground but if you stop sending end trip

---------03:07----------
to ground so this is n trip over here it

---------03:09----------
will turn itself on so I want to see

---------03:11----------
what that PP 5 vs 3 voltage becomes when

---------03:16----------
I decide to get rid of the end trip

---------03:18----------
signal does it not go up at all does it

---------03:20----------
go up does it go up only partially

---------03:22----------
because the chip is not working properly

---------03:24----------
the only way to find out is to remove

---------03:26----------
this chip q70 221 we're going to remove

---------03:29----------
that and see what happens so CEQ 72 to 1

---------03:34----------
that brings us over here on the

---------03:36----------
motherboard and let's see what happens

---------03:40----------
when we take that off let's see if we

---------03:41----------
get any progress let's see if anything

---------03:43----------
turns on so we're going to switch over

---------03:44----------
here to the microscope camera alright so

---------03:46----------
unfortunately for a short period of time

---------03:48----------
actually for a damn near 10 minutes of

---------03:50----------
troubleshooting there was no sound

---------03:52----------
because I forgot to plug my microphone

---------03:54----------
back in and that video just doesn't

---------03:56----------
really make sense without it so what I'm

---------03:57----------
going to do here is I'm going to explain

---------03:58----------
what happened during that time that

---------04:00----------
there was no video so the first thing

---------04:01----------
that I tried to do is I removed cue 72

---------04:04----------
21 on the schematic for an 8 - 0 31 15

---------04:07----------
board now here's the way you 70-200

---------04:09----------
works if it's it will always have a

---------04:12----------
voltage on the entropy and it will

---------04:13----------
always be trying to produce PP 5 es 3

---------04:16----------
however if the voltage that's created by

---------04:18----------
you 70-200 the end tripping get shorted

---------04:21----------
to ground let's say by a transistor

---------04:24----------
that's going to ground based on an input

---------04:26----------
signal to enable or disable the power

---------04:28----------
line then it will not create that

---------04:30----------
voltage rail so the first thing I did is

---------04:31----------
I removed Q 72 21 and I wanted to see if

---------04:34----------
it was if it would start creating a

---------04:36----------
voltage rail you know the again if it

---------04:37----------
would create let's say one or two volts

---------04:39----------
I'd know that something with the buck

---------04:40----------
converter was up if it would

---------04:43----------
create a full voltage then I don't maybe

---------04:45----------
something with the PCH was up the

---------04:47----------
PCH is what sends the signal to Q 72 21

---------04:50----------
to tell it that it should start going on

---------04:53----------
creating power and not letting power

---------04:55----------
through so that u 7200 n trip pin can

---------04:58----------
get shorted to ground or not get shorted

---------05:00----------
to gram I wanted to see what it was is

---------05:02----------
this a volt is this a chip problem where

---------05:05----------
it's not creating power at all or is

---------05:06----------
this a problem with the enable circuitry

---------05:08----------
that's the first thing you want to do it

---------05:09----------
again before you start troubleshooting a

---------05:11----------
circuit that may be working see if it's

---------05:13----------
simply not being told to turn on I did

---------05:15----------
that and I got nowhere I got 0 volts so

---------05:18----------
then I tried checking for a short to

---------05:20----------
ground using my multimeter and you can

---------05:22----------
see how I've checked for short to ground

---------05:23----------
countless times in other videos what I

---------05:25----------
did I put the multimeter to diode mode

---------05:26----------
after the multimeter was in diode 1 I

---------05:28----------
picked the red probe on ground but the

---------05:31----------
red probe on thank you magnet the red

---------05:33----------
probe on ground the black probe on where

---------05:35----------
pp5 es3 is supposed to be and there was

---------05:37----------
no short so then what I wanted to do is

---------05:39----------
I wanted to see if there was the only

---------05:40----------
problem I wanted to see if that was all

---------05:42----------
that was wrong with it

---------05:43----------
so what I did is I put the power supply

---------05:45----------
to 5 volts I attached the ground of the

---------05:48----------
power supply to the computer and then I

---------05:49----------
attached the power of the power supply

---------05:53----------
the plus at 5 volts to where pp5 es3 is

---------05:56----------
supposed to be on the board and when I

---------05:57----------
was done with all this it still didn't

---------05:59----------
work then when I decided to do is I

---------06:02----------
decided you know what what went wrong

---------06:04----------
with this so the problem with this

---------06:05----------
machine is that the the hard drive the

---------06:08----------
guy tried to replace is on hard drive

---------06:09----------
and it didn't work the hard drive is

---------06:11----------
only powered by PP 5 ESL PP 5 ESO is

---------06:14----------
created from PP 5 es 3 which is

---------06:17----------
controlled by you 7201 so if anything

---------06:20----------
funky happened during the hard drive

---------06:21----------
replacement the most likely place that I

---------06:23----------
should look to you know on my brain is

---------06:26----------
you 7201 and or you 7200 and

---------06:31----------
that's what I did and then I wind up

---------06:32----------
replacing this chip and that's the step

---------06:34----------
that you're going to see next and then

---------06:35----------
you're going to see if that works

---------06:36----------
so again one of the things I wanted to

---------06:38----------
mention that I was mentioning in that

---------06:39----------
video a portion of the video that got

---------06:41----------
erased is on power lines in the machine

---------06:43----------
so pp5 vs3 is not a different power line

---------06:49----------
than pp5 ESO so what is five es OPP

---------06:53----------
olace cramming pp just think that stands

---------06:55----------
for power you know not piss PPE power

---------06:58----------
then 5 V 5 volts now SOS 3s 5 that's

---------07:03----------
probably where you're getting confused

---------07:04----------
as all means that's a power rail when

---------07:07----------
the computers on so s our power states

---------07:09----------
so that's what the S is state as five

---------07:11----------
computer is off as three computer is

---------07:14----------
hibernating or computer is sleeping and

---------07:16----------
as Oh computer is on now there are

---------07:20----------
things that you need to have 5 volts on

---------07:22----------
there are places you need to have 5

---------07:23----------
volts on e or even when the computer is

---------07:25----------
sleeping so that you know it retains you

---------07:27----------
you the contents of your memory and it's

---------07:29----------
ready to go as soon as you hit the power

---------07:30----------
button again but there are also parts of

---------07:32----------
this computer that are only on when it's

---------07:35----------
in an Esso state for example the CPU

---------07:37----------
there's no reason for the CPU to be

---------07:39----------
using power there's no reason for the

---------07:40----------
graphics chip to be using power while

---------07:42----------
it's sleeping so those are only on when

---------07:44----------
it's in an Esso state there's no need to

---------07:46----------
create a different 5 volt for both of

---------07:47----------
these there's absolutely no need but so

---------07:49----------
what we do here with the Apple designers

---------07:51----------
and most motherboard designers do is

---------07:53----------
they simply take the power from that s3

---------07:55----------
rail and then they say okay when we tell

---------07:58----------
you to send the power from the s3 rail

---------08:00----------
through to all this other stuff so

---------08:02----------
they'll be a transistor in between the

---------08:04----------
s3 rail and all the components on the S

---------08:07----------
or that need s o power like the CPU like

---------08:11----------
the hard drive like the graphics chip

---------08:13----------
and so on and so forth so that's how

---------08:15----------
that works so when a part of the

---------08:17----------
computer sends a signal to that little

---------08:19----------
transistor it'll allow all that pp5 es3

---------08:21----------
power to become PP 5 ESO power the hard

---------08:24----------
drive is powered by PP 5 ESO this chip

---------08:26----------
controls PP 5 vs 3 PP 5 es 5 pp 3 V 3 s

---------08:31----------
5 it has nothing to do with with PP 5

---------08:34----------
ESL but PP 5 ESO comes from PP 5 es 3

---------08:38----------
and that is why the this chip got blown

---------08:42----------
up up at with the hard drive

---------08:44----------
something

---------08:44----------
 up happen with the five volts

---------08:46----------
going to the hard drive that up

---------08:47----------
the chip that creates PP 5 es 3 which is

---------08:50----------
responsible for PP 5 ESL this is all

---------08:52----------
stuff you'll see if you simply search

---------08:54----------
the schematic if you simply look through

---------08:55----------
and have a diagnostic mindset and you

---------08:57----------
using your brain and then that that's

---------08:59----------
that okay I just had my my food I'm a

---------09:02----------
little fatter and a little bit more

---------09:05----------
comfortable now let's get started I'm

---------09:08----------
replacing some of this stuff here okay

---------09:15----------
get the machine under the microscope and

---------09:20----------
this must replace this chip like at

---------09:25----------
least 50% of the border pairs that I do

---------09:27----------
there's always a PP 5 vs 3 always a TP s

---------09:32----------
5 1 1 2 5 related problem let's get this

---------09:36----------
here so I don't get cancer as I always

---------09:37----------
like to say I don't like cancer I don't

---------09:40----------
wish to get cancer

---------09:41----------
I wish cancer on anybody well I'm sure

---------09:47----------
there is some that I do I just can't

---------09:48----------
think of their names right now ok remove

---------09:59----------
the old one oh you want to see don't you

---------10:02----------
aren't you guys selfish

---------10:16----------
now I notice I think it's in focus up

---------10:18----------
here and then I look at the screen and

---------10:20----------
it's not in focus and I want to get it

---------10:21----------
in focus on the screen it looks much

---------10:23----------
better up here than I and I thought it

---------10:25----------
would ever look so hey now we're going

---------10:29----------
to take some time because this is the

---------10:31----------
new hako heating element that I got

---------10:32----------
there's nothing like my old trusty five

---------10:36----------
year old tacho eating element that was

---------10:37----------
originally on here of course the chips

---------10:50----------
not ready to go you've only had 15 20

---------10:54----------
seconds of the heat at 8:00 in the air

---------10:56----------
at 15 okay

---------11:05----------
this thing ain't what it used to be

---------11:27----------
too much on the center pad that's my

---------11:32----------
signature soldering of all the

---------11:36----------
things I like to up when soldering

---------11:39----------
doing a qfn package too much solder on

---------11:42----------
the center pad

---------11:54----------
and

---------12:33----------
disgusting isn't it oh my god that's

---------12:38----------
gross this guy's an idiot he doesn't

---------12:43----------
know what he's doing he's a idiot

---------13:14----------
Hey

---------13:16----------
where it's supposed to be sitting this

---------13:22----------
tip is bent a lot more than it used to

---------13:24----------
be so see how it's bent now I'm going to

---------13:28----------
be showing you what the newer tip looks

---------13:29----------
like when it comes in it's going to be a

---------13:31----------
lot better than this and more suited to

---------13:32----------
this this work I'm excited

---------13:39----------
supposed to come in tomorrow

---------13:42----------
I love Amazon Prime for that and you

---------13:45----------
know that they're losing money I mean it

---------13:47----------
wasn't just the shipping prices and I

---------13:48----------
know that it wasn't even just guessing

---------13:50----------
about it it wasn't just looking at the

---------13:53----------
weight and then the price and then

---------13:55----------
laughing at the idea that FedEx would

---------13:56----------
give them the rates that they give them

---------13:58----------
that's not it it's the it's just every

---------14:01----------
single time I use Amazon Prime now it's

---------14:03----------
like we'll give you this digital

---------14:05----------
download for free please for the love of

---------14:07----------
God just don't choose today shipping

---------14:09----------
like they have all these ways that are

---------14:11----------
begging you not to use the prime which

---------14:14----------
is which makes me happy because it means

---------14:17----------
that they're losing money so I actually

---------14:19----------
make sure to use the one day every time

---------14:21----------
even though I know they're losing off of

---------14:23----------
it because I know that they'll often say

---------14:24----------
like the difference between two day

---------14:25----------
shipping and one day shipping is like a

---------14:27----------
dollar or two and I know that that's not

---------14:29----------
it I know they're paying more than a

---------14:30----------
dollar for the difference between it so

---------14:32----------
I'll always choose that shipping knowing

---------14:33----------
that they're going to lose money on it

---------14:34----------
because I love seeing Amazon lose money

---------14:36----------
because they're their and how

---------14:38----------
they treat people on the Amazon

---------14:39----------
Marketplace they're worse than even so

---------14:42----------
like customer buys something on Friday

---------14:45----------
with next day shipping customer files A

---------14:48----------
to Z claim on Saturday because he

---------14:50----------
doesn't understand that Saturday is not

---------14:52----------
a business day because he's an idiot

---------14:53----------
you don't reply within 24 hours because

---------14:57----------
it's Sunday in your home with your kids

---------14:59----------
or enjoying your life or doing something

---------15:01----------
other than dealing with some rag

---------15:03----------
who decides to file a charge back

---------15:04----------
because he doesn't know understand how

---------15:05----------
the world works and then on

---------15:07----------
Monday you get you know the they win the

---------15:11----------
claim and you know what also happens on

---------15:13----------
Monday their package arrives they have

---------15:16----------
their money back and it's just a

---------15:18----------
azan as a thing like eBay there are a

---------15:21----------
lot of things I hate about eBay I would

---------15:22----------
never sell on eBay again and as much as

---------15:23----------
I hate eBay I kind of understand why

---------15:25----------
they are the way they are Amazon is just

---------15:28----------
come unnecessary

---------15:30----------
just really really mean for no

---------15:34----------
reason and it's really stupid so as you

---------15:37----------
can see here my theory was correct I was

---------15:40----------
will open this you can see that I

---------15:41----------
actually fixed something not just making

---------15:44----------
all this crap up

---------15:45----------
I mean before as you saw I didn't turn

---------15:47----------
on now this was missing PP 5 es 3 and

---------15:50----------
when I put 5 volts on PP 5 es 3 it still

---------15:54----------
wasn't turning on so what I did is I

---------15:56----------
checked I still suspected that chip

---------15:58----------
because the 5 volt power rail is the

---------16:00----------
only thing going to the drive the only

---------16:01----------
power going to the drive so something

---------16:02----------
had to mess up with the 5 volt power

---------16:03----------
line

---------16:04----------
I added 5 volts there and it still

---------16:06----------
didn't turn on I checked for a short in

---------16:07----------
the 5 volt rail none was present and I

---------16:10----------
really was confused and then I saw that

---------16:11----------
pp 3 v 3 was not present pp 3 V 3 is a

---------16:15----------
power rail pp 3 B 3 s 5 and pp 3 B 3 s 3

---------16:18----------
they're both power rails that are

---------16:19----------
created by the same u 7,200 chip so what

---------16:22----------
I decided to do again I'm pretty sure I

---------16:23----------
could turn this off you guys know that

---------16:25----------
it works now so I decided to do is I

---------16:27----------
decided to replace the chip that's

---------16:28----------
responsible for both and when I did it

---------16:31----------
worked perfectly so you get what you're

---------16:33----------
going to notice the more you watch this

---------16:34----------
channel the more you're going to notice

---------16:36----------
that TPS 5 1 1 2 5 it really is a chip

---------16:38----------
that you should have spools of like this

---------16:40----------
over here this may seem like a big spool

---------16:42----------
to you guys that don't do board repair

---------16:44----------
this is this is like a one-week supply

---------16:46----------
for me this will be gone by the end of

---------16:48----------
the week it really is that popular chip

---------16:50----------
and really just die that often on does

---------16:53----------
this mean that you're going to start

---------16:54----------
every one of your board repairs by

---------16:55----------
replacing this because Luis said that it

---------16:57----------
dies often no you're going to use your

---------16:58----------
 brain you're going to use the

---------17:00----------
schematic and the board view and

---------17:01----------
everything I've taught you here to find

---------17:02----------
out what your problem is before you jump

---------17:05----------
to the conclusion that you can just

---------17:06----------
follow somebody else's solution to

---------17:09----------
somebody else's problem and apply it to

---------17:10----------
your problem and have it work but at the

---------17:12----------
same time if this is something that Oh

---------17:17----------
 fever this is something that you

---------17:20----------
need to you should have in stock if

---------17:22----------
you're doing this and again this just

---------17:24----------
think if you think this all becomes a

---------17:27----------
lot easier tell me that was on camera so

---------17:32----------
I have this yeah I have the air filter

---------17:34----------
here this actually sucked up my spool of

---------17:36----------
chips oh that's not funny I hope they're

---------17:39----------
still in there when I open it

---------17:42----------
either way you know what even if it's

---------17:45----------
not that entire spool of chips cause far

---------17:49----------
less than I'm charging this guy from
