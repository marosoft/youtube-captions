---------00:16----------
I get a light in the charger but it's

---------00:18----------
dead this hey it's not dead I see a fan

---------00:21----------
spinning but then it turns off then

---------00:27----------
turns back on but then it turns off but

---------00:35----------
then it turns on all right let's see

---------00:40----------
what did you mess up so you replace the

---------00:41----------
battery and means something with Karen

---------00:44----------
sensing or battery charging circuitry

---------00:46----------
which is gonna be right in this area the

---------00:48----------
board the customer claims they changed

---------00:50----------
the battery and after that it was dead

---------00:52----------
changing the battery is gonna be

---------00:54----------
something to do with the battery

---------00:55----------
charging chip you 7000 u 7000 who's

---------01:00----------
responsible for charging the battery so

---------01:01----------
let's take a look at that chip on the

---------01:03----------
board okay it's got a little bit of food

---------01:05----------
on it nothing that I'm not used to so

---------01:07----------
the first thing we're gonna do here is

---------01:08----------
check the current sensing current

---------01:10----------
sensing is going to be between pins 27

---------01:12----------
and 28 pin 17 and 18 now the way this is

---------01:14----------
gonna work is that this is a stream this

---------01:18----------
is power coming in from the adapter and

---------01:20----------
think of this as a stream now this chip

---------01:22----------
which is gonna charge the battery and

---------01:23----------
control the charger it's gonna want to

---------01:25----------
know how much power is going through the

---------01:27----------
stream well you can't see how how fast

---------01:30----------
the water is moving around hard the

---------01:32----------
water is moving by looking at a stream

---------01:34----------
you have to put your hand in the water

---------01:35----------
so what's going on here is think of our

---------01:38----------
70 20 as the hand in the water and think

---------01:41----------
of the u 7000 like your your friend who

---------01:43----------
you want to tell how fast the water is

---------01:45----------
moving so what's gonna happen is the

---------01:47----------
voltage is going to go through our

---------01:48----------
seventy twenty there's gonna be a mount

---------01:52----------
a voltage drop through our 70 20 and

---------01:54----------
that teeny-tiny voltage drop is gonna

---------01:56----------
get measured by u 7000 which has a line

---------02:00----------
going to the top and the bottom of that

---------02:02----------
resistor the greater the voltage drop

---------02:03----------
the more current being used now there's

---------02:05----------
a 10 ohm resistor sitting in between

---------02:07----------
these 7000 chipset and this up here so

---------02:12----------
our 7022 is 10 ohms this is 0.02 ohms

---------02:16----------
and that's 10 ohms so my loop between

---------02:17----------
pinch 27 and 28 should be 20 point is

---------02:21----------
0-2 ohms

---------02:23----------
however let's see if we get on this

---------02:25----------
board my loop between those pins

---------02:29----------
according to my multimeter software is

---------02:36----------
20 ohms so no problem so now we're gonna

---------02:39----------
check the battery current sensing down

---------02:41----------
here that's gonna be a different loop

---------02:43----------
that's got a 2.2 ohm resistor is your

---------02:45----------
own resistor and 0.01 ohm resistor so my

---------02:48----------
total impedance of that circuit should

---------02:50----------
be two point two one ohms and let's see

---------02:55----------
if that's what we get over here

---------03:01----------
forty eight ohms what

---------03:06----------
that is way too many ohms all right so

---------03:11----------
there's a couple of possibilities here

---------03:13----------
behind door number one are 70 51 is

---------03:17----------
blown behind door number two are 70 52

---------03:21----------
is blown behind door number three are 70

---------03:25----------
50 is blown behind door number four the

---------03:27----------
traces between the ISL and the resistors

---------03:30----------
are blown so how are we gonna figure out

---------03:32----------
what that is well we're gonna do is use

---------03:35----------
Paul Daniels as software to find those

---------03:37----------
resistors and measure them individually

---------03:39----------
don't delay check out Paul Daniels at PL

---------03:43----------
Daniel's dot-com today so I'm gonna

---------03:46----------
right click on the software I'm gonna

---------03:48----------
click on our 70 51 and it's gonna show

---------03:50----------
me right where it is on the board view

---------03:54----------
we're gonna measure that resistor and

---------03:56----------
that resistor is fine it's 2.5 um it's

---------04:03----------
probably closer to 2 point 2 ohms the

---------04:05----------
reason that is is because the other

---------04:07----------
resistor is gonna be the one next to it

---------04:09----------
that's gonna be the blown one why cuz

---------04:12----------
that's the one that's under the damn

---------04:13----------
edge bonding and under fill' yay of

---------04:16----------
course it's gonna be that one that blows

---------04:19----------
it's an apple product it's always gonna

---------04:21----------
be the inconvenient resistor that blows

---------04:23----------
ah but what are you gonna do mother

---------04:41----------
I'm letting a current sense resistor

---------04:43----------
drive me nuts but do you guys understand

---------04:46----------
why it is I went for this even though it

---------04:47----------
looked good do you understand why this

---------04:49----------
was the circuit that I decided to spend

---------04:51----------
my time on think of the user description

---------04:53----------
this is something that happens all too

---------04:54----------
much in the forum that people are

---------04:56----------
ignoring they're ignoring the history of

---------04:57----------
the device you're like McNulty or Lennie

---------04:59----------
Briscoe are one of those people what was

---------05:01----------
the story what happened this is not

---------05:02----------
electronics repair this is not

---------05:04----------
engineering this is not physics this is

---------05:06----------
not chemistry this is not calculus

---------05:08----------
this is detective work I got a 70 in

---------05:11----------
almost all my classes in high school and

---------05:13----------
I had a cheat to get out of chemistry

---------05:15----------
with a 55 or 58 on my Regents and I can

---------05:17----------
still do this why detective work you

---------05:20----------
gotta see a whole picture I plugged in

---------05:23----------
the battery I up lucked in a new battery

---------05:25----------
when I plugged in my new battery which

---------05:27----------
they probably got off of Amazon cuz

---------05:29----------
they're a cheapskate and I could tell

---------05:31----------
that they're a cheapskate because

---------05:32----------
instead of buying a new cover they taped

---------05:34----------
their rubber pads the lid on a machine

---------05:37----------
where you can buy this bottom cover for

---------05:39----------
$20 on eBay with good pads why would you

---------05:41----------
do that unless you're cheap so they most

---------05:43----------
likely got some cheap-ass Amazon battery

---------05:46----------
for 10 or 20 bucks unlike those amazing

---------05:48----------
batteries that you can get on stored on

---------05:50----------
Rosman groov.com don't delay they won't

---------05:52----------
fry your current sensing circuitry today

---------05:54----------
maybe tomorrow but not today no I'm

---------05:56----------
kidding they're good batteries but my

---------05:57----------
point is cheap battery plugged in so

---------05:59----------
then that brings me to the battery

---------06:01----------
charging circuit and this is something

---------06:02----------
that you're probably not going to find

---------06:03----------
if you're just looking for what looks

---------06:05----------
bad because nothing here looks bad

---------06:06----------
there's nothing wrong with the section

---------06:08----------
of the board from a purely visual

---------06:10----------
standpoint so ice I go over to here and

---------06:12----------
I check the current sensing now I check

---------06:14----------
the current sensing on the charger and

---------06:16----------
it works I honestly kind of knew that

---------06:17----------
work before I even measured it cuz

---------06:18----------
that's not what was wrong the battery

---------06:20----------
current sensing circuit that's the one

---------06:22----------
that's gonna have the blown resistor and

---------06:23----------
there you go it's a mystery case it's a

---------06:27----------
mystery case and I solved the mystery

---------06:30----------
now do I get a burrito that tastes good

---------06:31----------
because I solved the mystery no it's not

---------06:34----------
fair my burrito okay but anyway let's

---------06:40----------
remove this yep that audio I see is

---------06:43----------
coming straight up off the board you

---------06:45----------
mother

---------06:48----------
breathe Louis breathe

---------06:55----------
got to practice my Lamaze breathing I

---------06:58----------
want to have kids someday so I should

---------07:00----------
practice my Lamaze breathing

---------07:06----------
all right so that's where it when it's

---------07:08----------
in place now I'd like to just make sure

---------07:10----------
it's pressed evenly onto the board I was

---------07:12----------
smart I'd leave well enough alone okay

---------07:15----------
you're good and next comes up the

---------07:18----------
resistor

---------07:29----------
then then we'll see if this worked and I

---------07:31----------
hope it did I really hope that it did if

---------07:34----------
any luck this did a this is gonna be a

---------07:37----------
beautiful board okay so let's see power

---------07:45----------
on

---------07:48----------
give me a chime dong yes that's what I

---------07:54----------
want to see an apple and a nice long

---------07:56----------
dong you always want a nice long dong

---------08:00----------
okay so now we're gonna plug the

---------08:02----------
original battery in and see if it

---------08:04----------
charges it am I asking too much there oh

---------08:07----------
look at that orange light can you see

---------08:11----------
that is it too light here

---------08:12----------
probably if to lower the ISO in the

---------08:14----------
camera for you to see that yeah let's

---------08:19----------
look can you see the orange light I

---------08:21----------
lowered the ISO a bunch

---------08:23----------
slow it a little more hey you guys see

---------08:26----------
that

---------08:26----------
that means we're charging so that is it

---------08:31----------
and we fixed our problem which is pretty

---------08:37----------
cool I like having a successful repair

---------08:39----------
and since I heard the Dom I know my

---------08:43----------
audio probably works

---------08:44----------
that's EQ I mean to see what that audio

---------08:47----------
IC was for q9 four to five it's actually

---------08:51----------
not for audio I was being a dumbass that

---------08:54----------
is actually for thunderbolt yep I'm dumb

---------08:58----------
that was not for audio that was

---------08:59----------
Thunderbolt I had it mixed up my bad

---------09:01----------
sorry about that so I'm sure that works

---------09:05----------
just fine so that's about it for that

---------09:08----------
board and awesome
