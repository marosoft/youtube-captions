---------00:00----------
all right so today we are going to be

---------00:01----------
working on a Macbook that appears to

---------00:03----------
have been abused by another facility but

---------00:05----------
before we get started on that repair let

---------00:07----------
me just remind you that everything we do

---------00:09----------
here has been made possible by your

---------00:10----------
support of stored Rossman group.com the

---------00:14----------
one sponsor that is stuck with us

---------00:15----------
through thick and thin who has stayed

---------00:17----------
with us when our video has been

---------00:19----------
demonetised or when a video has been

---------00:21----------
considered controversial or when I have

---------00:23----------
said something that people don't like

---------00:24----------
the one sponsor that has always been

---------00:27----------
there is stored Rosman group comm

---------00:29----------
because I own it and as you can see over

---------00:31----------
here store dot Rossman group comm has

---------00:34----------
become even more dedicated to ensuring

---------00:36----------
that you get the parts you need at the

---------00:38----------
prices you deserve the quick 861 DW hot

---------00:42----------
air rework station is down to 250 $4.99

---------00:46----------
and free shipping you will not find this

---------00:48----------
price anywhere else because we have

---------00:50----------
managed to negotiate a better price on

---------00:52----------
them by buying hundreds and hundreds of

---------00:54----------
them and screaming at them for not

---------00:55----------
meeting manufacturing deadlines faster

---------00:57----------
than Tim Cook screams at a Chinese

---------00:59----------
person that hasn't built enough iPhone

---------01:01----------
10s fast enough for a dollar an hour

---------01:02----------
that is true in this point we have the

---------01:05----------
best pricing on many of these items we

---------01:08----------
have chips for iPhone iPod iPad MacBook

---------01:11----------
and then some we have ultrasonic

---------01:13----------
cleaners we got the best prices on

---------01:15----------
solder pastes we got the best prices on

---------01:17----------
flux we have the best selection of all

---------01:19----------
of these items end starting today we

---------01:22----------
have not just one employee we have two

---------01:25----------
new employees whose sole job it is to

---------01:27----------
make sure that things on store dot

---------01:29----------
Rossman group comm are in stock are

---------01:31----------
shipped quickly and that your questions

---------01:33----------
are answered are you sick and tired of

---------01:35----------
dealing with the fact that when you have

---------01:36----------
a problem with your order that your

---------01:38----------
email goes to my cell phone while I'm on

---------01:39----------
a bike riding my bank no more we have

---------01:42----------
two full time staff members that do

---------01:44----------
nothing but ensure that your store dot

---------01:46----------
rossmann group calm experience is

---------01:48----------
everything it should be so don't delay

---------01:50----------
buy today now with that being said we

---------01:54----------
are gonna get started on an abused

---------01:56----------
little macbook let's go over this I have

---------01:59----------
a mid 2014 MacBook Pro bought in January

---------02:02----------
of 2015

---------02:03----------
it needed a trackpad replace and in May

---------02:05----------
2015 and I took it to a local shop when

---------02:08----------
I got it back the fan ran consistently

---------02:10----------
high I took it back and they spend one

---------02:12----------
to two months trying to correct

---------02:13----------
this one to two months and then sending

---------02:18----------
to Florida headquarters for a system

---------02:20----------
board replacement when I got it back

---------02:21----------
they said it was fixed but they had only

---------02:23----------
installed the fan regulation software to

---------02:25----------
manage the fan speed and didn't tell me

---------02:28----------
I was moving at the time it didn't test

---------02:30----------
a laptop until over a month later and so

---------02:32----------
I tried to reinstall tried some advice

---------02:34----------
online to no avail I've just had it in a

---------02:36----------
laptop case since I'd like to have the

---------02:38----------
system overall assess if possible so

---------02:40----------
that I can know what it would cost to

---------02:41----------
fix the trackpad system board Mac's fan

---------02:42----------
issue and then anything else that needs

---------02:44----------
updating also filled in the forum is

---------02:46----------
sending this in but forgot to include

---------02:47----------
notes the Machine always runs terribly

---------02:49----------
slowly even when one app is running if

---------02:51----------
you have been watching this channel for

---------02:53----------
a while then you probably understand

---------02:55----------
that this type of issue on this machine

---------02:57----------
when it's running really slowly in the

---------02:58----------
fan spinning high is likely a sensor

---------03:01----------
issue MacBooks have more sensors than

---------03:02----------
almost any other machine and instead of

---------03:05----------
telling you hey this sensor is not

---------03:07----------
working what happens when the sensor is

---------03:08----------
reporting something silly is that the

---------03:10----------
machine just starts to work like

---------03:12----------
and instead of having four or five or

---------03:14----------
six sensors these things have like 14 or

---------03:16----------
30 so it can be a bit of a pain in the

---------03:18----------
ass so this machine even though it was

---------03:21----------
purchased in January 2015 is actually a

---------03:24----------
2013 - the model so what you can do with

---------03:27----------
these machines since they have the older

---------03:29----------
board is you can run something called

---------03:30----------
the Apple service diagnostic this is

---------03:33----------
something that you used to be able to

---------03:34----------
find somewhere on the dark corners of

---------03:35----------
the Internet but you can't find that

---------03:37----------
anymore because now you need to use

---------03:39----------
something called gsx to diagnose sensor

---------03:41----------
failures before you could just go online

---------03:44----------
get a copy of this thing you could run

---------03:46----------
it and it would tell you the sensor that

---------03:47----------
failed now you can only have access to

---------03:50----------
that if you plug the machine in you log

---------03:53----------
in with your Apple credentials and run

---------03:54----------
that specific test for that specific

---------03:56----------
machine Apple has gotten so gestapo with

---------03:59----------
this crap that if you simply want to

---------04:00----------
know which sensor in your machine has

---------04:02----------
failed you must go through an Apple

---------04:04----------
authorized service provider that way

---------04:05----------
there's more will not fix your

---------04:08----------
motherboard so the people that have

---------04:09----------
access to the tool that will let you

---------04:11----------
know which sensor is failed are the same

---------04:13----------
people that will not fix your

---------04:16----------
motherboard Apple now luckily I got

---------04:20----------
myself access to this little tool

---------04:21----------
because again here we specialize in

---------04:24----------
giving the middle finger to all those

---------04:25----------
policies that say that third-party

---------04:27----------
the riser pair don't get access to this

---------04:29----------
stuff so let's take a look at this

---------04:31----------
MacBook we're gonna go over to my

---------04:32----------
overhead camera now the first sign that

---------04:34----------
your machine has been worked on by it

---------04:36----------
peseta dumbasses besides the fact that

---------04:38----------
they put software to read to the fans is

---------04:40----------
that the battery is flopping out what

---------04:42----------
the is this when you replace the

---------04:44----------
trackpad you remove the original

---------04:46----------
adhesive you remove the original

---------04:49----------
adhesive not leave this there and

---------04:51----------
then put new good adhesive this is

---------04:53----------


---------04:54----------
the batter look what what the is

---------04:56----------
this what is this this is garbage

---------04:58----------
don't do this it's terrible awful yeah

---------05:03----------
now the software for the fans is

---------05:06----------
somewhat understandable and let me

---------05:08----------
explain why I think that is before we

---------05:11----------
really dig in and get started here so

---------05:13----------
there are certain machines like there

---------05:14----------
are certain IMAX where if you do not use

---------05:18----------
a hard drive that came with the machine

---------05:19----------
the fan will run fast all the time so

---------05:22----------
what you can do is you can either put

---------05:24----------
software there to disable that sensor or

---------05:27----------
what you can do is you can mess with the

---------05:29----------
sensor or short the two pins of the

---------05:31----------
sensor together so I understand why in

---------05:33----------
some cases people would feel inclined to

---------05:37----------
mess around or not do the proper fix

---------05:41----------
because the proper fix would require you

---------05:44----------
putting in a hard drive that was

---------05:45----------
designed you know ten years ago or eight

---------05:47----------
years ago into the computer and

---------05:49----------
obviously with something like a hard

---------05:50----------
drive that's kind of like a tire with

---------05:52----------
wear and tear you don't want to do that

---------05:53----------
and the way Apple designs these machines

---------05:55----------
very often you are forced to find these

---------05:57----------
workarounds and I explained that to this

---------05:59----------
customer when he called and live chatted

---------06:01----------
that sometimes stores do need to look

---------06:03----------
for these workarounds because there's

---------06:05----------
just no solution to it this machine here

---------06:07----------
is not one where that is the case you

---------06:10----------
have the tool here there's no sensors in

---------06:12----------
this machine that cannot be replaced

---------06:14----------
you can happily grab stuff off a donor

---------06:15----------
board so here i've run something called

---------06:17----------
the apple service diagnostic and in the

---------06:19----------
apple service diagnostic i can go to

---------06:20----------
hardware profile display hardware

---------06:22----------
profile and it will give me a list of

---------06:24----------
sensors so if we look at this hardware

---------06:26----------
profile and we look at the list of

---------06:27----------
sensors what you'll see is that we have

---------06:29----------
a couple of funky things here and now

---------06:32----------
over here you see TG o d GPU die analog

---------06:35----------
temp reading minus 124 celsius so that's

---------06:39----------
a sensor that has obviously failed

---------06:41----------
GPU dye digital temp - 124 Celsius that

---------06:46----------
is another sensor that has obviously

---------06:47----------
failed

---------06:47----------
it says th one H right-fin stack

---------06:50----------
temperature minus 124 Celsius and

---------06:55----------
left-fin stacked mt h 2h minus 124

---------06:59----------
celsius so what we have to do here is

---------07:01----------
i've written down all these temperature

---------07:02----------
sensors with my beautiful handwriting

---------07:04----------
that you can see here and we're going to

---------07:05----------
look through the schematic of the a20 37

---------07:08----------
87 board that's in this machine to try

---------07:10----------
to get an idea of what these have in

---------07:12----------
common because there's no oh just

---------07:14----------
replace the sensor i see kind of thing

---------07:16----------
going on here i want to figure out what

---------07:18----------
these have in common to see if there's a

---------07:19----------
specific line a specific chip a specific

---------07:21----------
resistor or something that may be

---------07:23----------
up here so the first thing that we're

---------07:25----------
gonna do is go through the schematic and

---------07:27----------
the board view for an 8 - 0 - 37 87

---------07:30----------
board using paul daniels as flex board

---------07:32----------
view software that you should check out

---------07:34----------
at PL daniels calm don't delay by today

---------07:36----------
don't delay subscribe today don't delay

---------07:38----------
get a quick get flex board view get

---------07:40----------
everything that i Schill and just be

---------07:42----------
grateful that I don't subject you to

---------07:44----------
LastPass shilling LastPass offered me

---------07:46----------
$3,500 for one shout out in one video

---------07:51----------
$3,500 and yet still the only thing that

---------07:54----------
I shil is stored Rosman group calm

---------07:57----------
because I have faith in store awesome

---------08:00----------
group calm I stand behind store dot

---------08:03----------
rossmann group calm and let's go over

---------08:05----------
where we have sensors that talk to one

---------08:06----------
another here we go I see sensor chips so

---------08:11----------
this is CPU thermal sensor or not it

---------08:13----------
airflow proximity no now remember our

---------08:17----------
sensors that are failed or GPU die Jeep

---------08:20----------
left right they are GPU proximity GPU

---------08:23----------
die GPU die analog GPU die digital

---------08:26----------
left-fin stack right fin stack so what

---------08:29----------
combines all these so here we have check

---------08:33----------
this out GPU proximity check GPU die

---------08:36----------
check left-fin stack check right fin

---------08:39----------
stack check so we don't have an

---------08:41----------
individual sensor that's failed it's not

---------08:43----------
like left fin stack is reading 30

---------08:47----------
Celsius and this one's reading minus 24

---------08:50----------
all of them are reading that so what do

---------08:52----------
they all have in common they all have in

---------08:53----------
common

---------08:54----------
the

---------08:55----------
data line this chip are 5850 feeding at

---------08:59----------
a power source so it could be our 5850

---------09:01----------
that's a fault it could be this

---------09:03----------
capacitor shorting that's a ground after

---------09:04----------
it it could be something on this data

---------09:06----------
line pulling it down it could be u5850

---------09:09----------
that's bad I don't know but what I do

---------09:11----------
know is that that is gonna be suspect

---------09:13----------
number one so I am going to take the

---------09:16----------
board out of this MacBook and we're

---------09:20----------
gonna go from there

---------09:21----------
LastPass is good though it could be good

---------09:23----------
the thing with the LastPass people is

---------09:25----------
that they wanted me to make my video

---------09:27----------
unlisted show it to them for approval

---------09:30----------
then if they approve wait till it gets a

---------09:32----------
certain amount of use then after that

---------09:34----------
pay me to which I would I politely said

---------09:38----------
go yourself how about I how about

---------09:42----------
you pay me in advance I make the video

---------09:45----------
that I want to make you deal with it I

---------09:48----------
love when people say hey we want to

---------09:50----------
reach out to you but we want to set all

---------09:52----------
the terms of the know so I'm looking for

---------09:55----------
you

---------09:56----------
5850 and if you buy flex board view at

---------09:59----------
PL daniels dot-com you right-click on

---------10:01----------
the chip and it just brings you to where

---------10:04----------
it is is that not beautiful is that not

---------10:06----------
amazing so we're gonna look at that chip

---------10:09----------
and see if there's anything there that

---------10:11----------
gives us cause for concern and when we

---------10:13----------
look at the chip that is responsible for

---------10:15----------
all of this kind of looks fine actually

---------10:17----------
so we have our 58 50 which is supposed

---------10:20----------
to be supplying it with 3.3 volts this

---------10:23----------
is supposed to be 47 ohms and that

---------10:24----------
resistor is measuring 47 ohms so we

---------10:31----------
don't have a problem with that most

---------10:32----------
likely let's see if the data line is

---------10:34----------
shorted to ground so the data line is

---------10:35----------
gonna be on pins 9 and 10 see data line

---------10:39----------
I can just right click on this and paul

---------10:43----------
daniels of software will instantly paul

---------10:46----------
daniels of software will instant paul

---------10:48----------
daniels is software when I right click

---------10:52----------
will instantly show it on the board

---------10:55----------
 alright Paul Daniels our

---------10:58----------
software is a steaming pile of

---------11:00----------
 right there no I'm kidding so the

---------11:03----------
Apple engineer is what they do is

---------11:05----------
they'll use a different name in the

---------11:08----------
than they do in the board view and

---------11:09----------
there's no reason for it so see over

---------11:11----------
here it says smbus underscore SMC

---------11:13----------
underscore s or whatever and over here

---------11:15----------
it says SM bus underscore GPU therm

---------11:17----------
sense that's actually the same thing but

---------11:20----------
because they decided to make it to the

---------11:22----------
schematic we'll use a different

---------11:23----------
terminology than the board view and this

---------11:25----------
confuses students a lot so what you have

---------11:26----------
to do is just look at pin 9 of u5850

---------11:29----------
here and look at pin 9 of u5850 there

---------11:31----------
and you'll find it so it sucks here is

---------11:34----------
that it looks like this chip has

---------11:36----------
virtually no damage on it so what I was

---------11:39----------
going over before that was if you look

---------11:41----------
over here this is the data line so I

---------11:44----------
want to see if the data line pins are

---------11:46----------
shorted to ground and if they're not

---------11:47----------
shorted to ground at that point we are

---------11:50----------
at a severe disadvantage to figuring

---------11:53----------
this out so I'm gonna go into diode mode

---------11:55----------
and let's see what I get on each of

---------11:57----------
those pins and we get point seven one

---------12:00----------
zero and point seven oh nine which is

---------12:04----------
not in any way shape or form our short

---------12:06----------
to ground I'm also gonna plug in and

---------12:07----------
just make sure 3.3 volts is getting to

---------12:09----------
that chip and if it is then I'm just

---------12:11----------
gonna assume that the chip just so

---------12:13----------
happened to kill itself even though

---------12:14----------
everything else is fine because that's

---------12:16----------
that at that point that'll be the only

---------12:17----------
thing that I can think of logically that

---------12:20----------
would cause this issue I also don't

---------12:22----------
understand how this issue could result

---------12:23----------
from the trackpad itself being replaced

---------12:26----------
I would not blame the store for doing

---------12:29----------
this you know this key this is not going

---------12:31----------
to be some but at just after I went to

---------12:34----------
you or you know since I went to you know

---------12:36----------
none of that there's no way

---------12:39----------
that this can magically break from

---------12:41----------
replacing a trackpad this would just so

---------12:43----------
happen to be a very bad coincidence that

---------12:45----------
right after this customer either

---------12:46----------
trackpad replaced they had this issue or

---------12:48----------
even worse maybe the customer had this

---------12:51----------
issue before they had the trackpad

---------12:52----------
replaced and that customer then decided

---------12:54----------
to blame this store which would be kind

---------12:57----------
of shitty but again I don't know the

---------12:58----------
whole story but just to be clear this is

---------13:00----------
not something that could ever occur or

---------13:03----------
result from replacing a trackpad this

---------13:06----------
would just have if that chip failed in

---------13:08----------
that manner it would just be pure it

---------13:10----------
would be a purely bad luck that caused

---------13:13----------
that to occur now it could also be

---------13:15----------
something that's pulling it down the SMC

---------13:17----------
is going to talk to the fin stack

---------13:19----------
temperature sensor the GPU temperature

---------13:21----------
sensor

---------13:22----------
and j40 0 2 which is the webcam I'm

---------13:25----------
gonna take a guess that rather than the

---------13:27----------
chip being bad at the actual webcam is

---------13:29----------
bad and that the webcam is pulling this

---------13:31----------
 down let's see if that's the case

---------13:33----------
so what I'm gonna try doing is I am

---------13:36----------
going to try plugging in everything in

---------13:38----------
the machine plugging in the webcam and

---------13:41----------
then seeing if the diode mode

---------13:42----------
measurement goes down when the webcam is

---------13:44----------
plugged in I'm also gonna try rerunning

---------13:47----------
that Apple service diagnostic with the

---------13:49----------
webcam not plugged in and we will go

---------13:52----------
from there

---------13:53----------
so let's plug this in with the webcam

---------13:58----------
because that is actually much more

---------14:01----------
likely it's more likely that something

---------14:03----------
is wrong with the webcam then that chip

---------14:05----------
just randomly decided to itself

---------14:07----------
even though it looks totally fine and

---------14:09----------
again to be clear there's no way that

---------14:12----------
we're placing a trackpad would do this

---------14:13----------
as much as I think it is shitty that a

---------14:16----------
store would install a battery like this

---------14:18----------
as crappy as I think this is I cannot

---------14:21----------
blame them for this this issue because

---------14:24----------
that you know I wouldn't want somebody

---------14:26----------
blaming me for that issue because God

---------14:29----------
knows I get blamed for enough that

---------14:31----------
I didn't actually cause it's like I

---------14:33----------
literally hired a full time person just

---------14:36----------
to deal with this that we get

---------14:37----------
blamed for that we didn't do like the

---------14:39----------
you know that guy on the weekend

---------14:41----------
installed Libre Office on my computer

---------14:43----------
and ever since he did that I get

---------14:45----------
flickering lines did you buy a 2011

---------14:48----------
MacBook with the GPU recall program yes

---------14:50----------
I did but okay do you understand that

---------14:54----------
installing Libre Office is not going to

---------14:56----------
kill your GPU well no but yes but ever

---------14:59----------
since he touched it okay then well

---------15:01----------
there's no like I've hired a person that

---------15:05----------
really does that for like eight hours a

---------15:07----------
 day five to six days a week like

---------15:11----------
that that's a job now so you know if I

---------15:13----------
don't want it to happen to me can't

---------15:15----------
blame mother I can blame him for this I

---------15:17----------
can't blame him for the sensor thing

---------15:19----------
because originally what I thought when

---------15:21----------
that when the customer said that this

---------15:23----------
person came in and had their trackpad

---------15:25----------
replaced and then the sensor was failing

---------15:27----------
I thought oh they put in a shitty

---------15:29----------
trackpad or they don't know that there's

---------15:30----------
a sensor in the trackpad because do keep

---------15:32----------
in mind TS 0p that

---------15:35----------
rest temperature sensor is not actually

---------15:37----------
in the palm rest it's in the trackpad

---------15:38----------
so if you install the wrong trackpad or

---------15:41----------
are you not even wrong if you just if

---------15:43----------
you mess up installing it or you install

---------15:45----------
a broken trackpad which I suppose would

---------15:46----------
be the wrong track pay you don't to give

---------15:48----------
somebody a broken one then you can cause

---------15:50----------
this issue but the sensors that are

---------15:51----------
failing have absolutely nothing to do

---------15:53----------
with the trackpad so I don't want to

---------15:57----------
blame the store that it was not

---------15:59----------
responsible for that they are

---------16:00----------
responsible for losing the screws they

---------16:03----------
are responsible for the battery and they

---------16:06----------
are responsible for the fact that after

---------16:08----------
two months they lack the ability to

---------16:10----------
solve this problem

---------16:11----------
that's shameful but they didn't

---------16:14----------
cause this so I'm gonna plug in the fans

---------16:17----------
and we're plugging in everything besides

---------16:18----------
the webcam I want to see if the webcam

---------16:21----------
does it and if the webcam does it then

---------16:24----------
you're not getting it webcam because

---------16:26----------
this is not a screen that you can take

---------16:28----------
apart to get to the webcam if you take

---------16:30----------
apart that screen it's done for it's

---------16:32----------
it's it's kaput you can't remove the

---------16:35----------
screen and get to the webcam that is a

---------16:36----------
ridiculously delicate screen and the

---------16:39----------
moment you remove it it is cracked into

---------16:41----------
bits and pieces which is absolutely not

---------16:44----------
worth it to get to the webcam you can

---------16:46----------
buy some twenty dollar webcam online all

---------16:48----------
right so we're loading up this beautiful

---------16:50----------
test operating system here and let's see

---------16:54----------
what it says on the sensor issues so

---------16:56----------
let's test the sensors and see what it

---------16:57----------
finds dcn and Biman are not working now

---------17:02----------
the SSD sensor is not working because

---------17:05----------
there's no SSD plugged in but as you can

---------17:08----------
see the left-fin stack is working the

---------17:12----------
right fin stack is working and the GPU

---------17:14----------
sensors are working now the ones that

---------17:16----------
don't work the ones that are reading

---------17:18----------
incorrectly those actually don't matter

---------17:20----------
I know this sounds silly but dcn test

---------17:23----------
who gives a that that's not you

---------17:24----------
know the DCN sensor is not reading right

---------17:27----------
because I don't have a charger plugged

---------17:28----------
in I don't give a about that I

---------17:30----------
don't care it's not sensing the proper

---------17:32----------
voltage because I don't have the charger

---------17:35----------
plugged in I'm running off the battery

---------17:36----------
battery monitor I don't care about that

---------17:39----------
so this here GPU sensors are reading

---------17:45----------
with an operating range and if I go to

---------17:47----------
hardware profile

---------17:49----------
and display hardware profile and I

---------17:54----------
scroll up to fin stack god this is

---------17:58----------
frustrating I hate doing working in EFI

---------18:01----------
mode here we go so fin stack temperature

---------18:04----------
it says 44 Celsius the other fin stack

---------18:07----------
is 58 Celsius GPU 61 Celsius die 75

---------18:14----------
Celsius analog die 69 Celsius change the

---------18:18----------
ISO on the camera so it's easier for you

---------18:20----------
to see that yeah so all of those sensors

---------18:26----------
are fine so every issue that we were

---------18:28----------
having with this machine was caused by

---------18:30----------
the fact that the webcam is at fault and

---------18:33----------
the this so now let's just confirm that

---------18:37----------
now I want to plug this in and show you

---------18:39----------
how the multimeter reading is actually

---------18:41----------
different so eight and nine pins eight

---------18:44----------
and nine are going to be the pin is

---------18:46----------
responsible for that so I'm gonna plug

---------18:47----------
in the webcam and I'm curious if those

---------18:49----------
get shorted to ground maybe you'd only

---------18:53----------
get shorts to ground when the machines

---------18:55----------
turned on but I'm just curious to see

---------18:56----------
what the result is I get here and before

---------18:59----------
we had point seven one something in

---------19:01----------
point seven zero something Wow touching

---------19:08----------
the heatsink is hot and now we get zero

---------19:11----------
point zero zero six and here we get

---------19:15----------
point six seven zero now watch what

---------19:17----------
happens when I unplug the webcam you got

---------19:21----------
zero point zero zero six right well with

---------19:24----------
the webcam not plugged in or you get

---------19:29----------
point six seven eight and point six

---------19:31----------
seven eight so as you can see it's easy

---------19:35----------
to prove here that the webcam is what's

---------19:37----------
pulling that data line down and because

---------19:39----------
the webcam is pulling that data line

---------19:40----------
down every sensor on that data line is

---------19:42----------
failing if you were to simply replace

---------19:45----------
the sensor chip you would be screwing

---------19:47----------
yourself and I get that in my chat I get

---------19:49----------
that in the forum I get that in phone

---------19:51----------
calls all the time how much to replace

---------19:53----------
my sensor chip and the reason I don't

---------19:55----------
answer that question and the reason I

---------19:56----------
refuse to do it

---------19:57----------
and the reason I occasionally get

---------19:59----------
one-star reviews from people that say

---------20:00----------
[Applause]

---------20:02----------
Sara please my is because I don't know

---------20:09----------
if there's the problem if I replace your

---------20:11----------
sensor and you want to pay only 50 bucks

---------20:13----------
because you diagnosed it yourself and I

---------20:17----------
replace your sensor and it doesn't work

---------20:19----------
are you still gonna pay me over here you

---------20:23----------
see that the SMC is going to speak to

---------20:25----------
the left and right fin stack temperature

---------20:27----------
sensor which also has the GPU

---------20:29----------
temperature sensor on that line this is

---------20:33----------
gonna all these things share one data

---------20:35----------
line so if anything on this line is

---------20:38----------
shorting it to ground you're not gonna

---------20:40----------
get any data so with these two resistors

---------20:43----------
over here do our 5350 and our 5351 they

---------20:47----------
are going to pull this line up so that

---------20:49----------
it's always 3.3 volts over here on this

---------20:52----------
side you have 3.3 volts and on the other

---------20:55----------
side of the resistor you'll have 3.3

---------20:57----------
volts now when these trips want to speak

---------20:59----------
to the SMC what they do is they will

---------21:02----------
short the line to ground for short

---------21:04----------
periods of time and think of it like

---------21:06----------
Morse code so when you have Morse code

---------21:08----------
you have you know beep beep B you know

---------21:13----------
here it's kind of like the same thing

---------21:14----------
every time the chip wants to talk it's

---------21:16----------
going to press the button down or in

---------21:19----------
this case it's going to short the signal

---------21:21----------
to ground and it's going to go to 0 but

---------21:23----------
then when it doesn't short it to ground

---------21:25----------
it goes back up to 3 so you're gonna

---------21:26----------
have a little waveform and think of the

---------21:28----------
waveform kind of like handwriting this

---------21:30----------
is how the chips gonna write so the

---------21:31----------
chips gonna write to the other chip it's

---------21:33----------
gonna go three zero three zero three

---------21:34----------
zero three zero but there has to be that

---------21:36----------
three there if there's something that is

---------21:38----------
permanently shorting it to ground it's

---------21:40----------
always at zero so if only if even only

---------21:42----------
one of the chips on that line is short

---------21:44----------
it's a ground all the time none of the

---------21:46----------
other chips will be able to speak to

---------21:48----------
each other because it's not gonna be

---------21:49----------
writing it's just gonna be name and you

---------21:52----------
can see the Sun in oscilloscope and you

---------21:53----------
can see it in my older videos and sensor

---------21:55----------
chips where you can actually see what

---------21:57----------
the waveform looks like there's not

---------21:58----------
going to be any waveform and here

---------22:00----------
there's no waveform because the web cam

---------22:02----------
this little plug here is pulling

---------22:04----------
everything down and causing it to not

---------22:06----------
work the webcam is at fault here so

---------22:08----------
while the store that sent this machine

---------22:10----------
in clearly does not know how to remember

---------22:12----------
put half of the screws back in the

---------22:14----------
computer does not know at a diagnosis

---------22:16----------
problem and does not know how to glue in

---------22:18----------
a battery they're not at fault for this

---------22:21----------
one it just so and now how does this

---------22:23----------
fail well you'll have to ask Apple also

---------22:26----------
why is it that Apple makes a computer

---------22:28----------
where the webcam having an issue will

---------22:30----------
make the entire computer to slow to work

---------22:33----------
properly think different think different

---------22:38----------
you know the web the webcam is not

---------22:40----------
working properly oh yeah your computer's

---------22:42----------
gonna run at 800 megahertz and the fans

---------22:43----------
are gonna spend in 6000 rpm that that's

---------22:46----------
just that's just the magic and the

---------22:47----------
beauty of Apple engineering at the very

---------22:50----------
least I hope this was an educational

---------22:51----------
video I very much so appreciate the

---------22:53----------
individual that decided to trust us and

---------22:55----------
send us this computer thank you very

---------22:57----------
much for sending it in I really

---------22:58----------
appreciate that

---------22:59----------
can you just disconnect the data lines

---------23:00----------
actually I could oh you're right I could

---------23:04----------
cut off the connection on the webcam

---------23:06----------
yeah I could cut the pins on the board

---------23:08----------
on the webcam for the data line cuz

---------23:10----------
that's only used for the ambient light

---------23:12----------
sensor so you know how the machines able

---------23:14----------
to tell whether or not to turn the

---------23:15----------
keyboard backlight on or off that's done

---------23:17----------
by the ambient light sensor and the

---------23:18----------
ambient light sensor is built into the

---------23:20----------
webcam and that speaks to the SMC on the

---------23:22----------
same data line as the left and right fin

---------23:25----------
stack temperature sensors and the GPU

---------23:26----------
temperature sensors why a data line is

---------23:29----------
being shared between GPU temperature

---------23:31----------
sensors and heat sink temperature

---------23:33----------
sensors and a light sensor is beyond me

---------23:37----------
because they have different ways of

---------23:38----------
dealing with failure if a temperature

---------23:40----------
sensor fails turn the fans on and slow

---------23:43----------
down the processor makes sense if a

---------23:44----------
light sensor fails who gives a you

---------23:47----------
know it's not like the end of the world

---------23:48----------
you don't have to change the way the

---------23:50----------
entire system operates for that so for

---------23:54----------
me it would seem to make more sense for

---------23:55----------
those two things to be on separate data

---------23:57----------
lines because one is mission-critical

---------23:58----------
while the other is not
