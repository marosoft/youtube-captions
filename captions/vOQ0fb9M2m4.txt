---------00:00----------
the capacitor on the right has been

---------00:01----------
developing blue balls the cap goes

---------00:03----------
short-circuit because of PCB flexing or

---------00:05----------
what the cap wound short circuit because

---------00:07----------
it was inside of an Apple product it

---------00:10----------
couldn't live up to its full potential

---------00:11----------
so it got blue balls and exploded so

---------00:14----------
today what we have here is a MacBook see

---------00:18----------
what's wrong with this MacBook and see

---------00:19----------
if we can make it work again the fan is

---------00:21----------
spinning looks like I don't have

---------00:25----------
anything on my screen let's see what the

---------00:27----------
voltage is that I get let's turn on the

---------00:32----------
good old fashioned multimeter ampere

---------00:35----------
hook it up to the Paul Daniels software

---------00:39----------
0 volts on backlight ok interesting but

---------00:44----------
doing something well I'm kind of curious

---------00:47----------
is this that flex gate issue or is this

---------00:49----------
gonna be a dead backlight issue Chris

---------00:53----------
remember this machine the backlight will

---------00:54----------
stop working if you open and close the

---------00:56----------
device too many times

---------00:57----------
put the multimeter in Homans mode

---------01:03----------
interesting 59 ohms to ground on

---------01:05----------
backlight so the backlight circuit is

---------01:08----------
shorted to ground that's kind of curious

---------01:10----------
so let's get this thing out of the case

---------01:13----------
in there that doesn't sound like flex

---------01:15----------
gate to me that's gonna go to ground to

---------01:17----------
the LED driver it could be that or it

---------01:20----------
could be one of these output capacitors

---------01:22----------
at the end of which there are many

---------01:30----------
there are many said it could be a shorty

---------01:32----------
connector hmm let's see if it's a shorty

---------01:38----------
connector what do you think Sonia let's

---------01:42----------
take the screen cable off and see if

---------01:44----------
Sonia is correct

---------01:48----------
hopefully not I'm hoping that she's

---------01:52----------
wrong can anybody guess why I'm hoping

---------01:54----------
that she's wrong

---------01:56----------
anybody know I am guessing that Sonia

---------01:58----------
got it wrong why I'm hoping not guessing

---------02:00----------
that she got it wrong thank God so hon

---------02:06----------
you happen to be wrong I'm very happy

---------02:08----------
with that because that means that I

---------02:09----------
don't have a dead seat for you ha you

---------02:14----------
hope Sonia is wrong because of money yes

---------02:16----------
we still have 6100 I'm short to ground

---------02:19----------
indeed I don't want a blown up CPU

---------02:21----------
that's not good for my day back white

---------02:23----------
capacitors look perfect

---------02:26----------
on this side they also look perfect do

---------02:31----------
any of these look bad to you

---------02:51----------
because these all look pretty nice to me

---------03:00----------
leftmost the leftmost capacitor is just

---------03:03----------
dirty

---------03:16----------
can anybody guess what we're gonna do

---------03:17----------
here

---------03:35----------
[Music]

---------03:40----------
I'll check it out James but you have to

clickable now donating

---------04:24----------
boys jwc what there

---------04:29----------
can anybody guess what's coming up next

---------04:35----------
what's about to happen to this MacBooks

---------04:38----------
backlight circuit

---------04:46----------
also everybody say hello to tar man he's

---------04:48----------
been here since day one close to day one

---------04:51----------

beginning so put that first and

---------08:15----------

that I've noticed over the years

---------08:55----------
honestly you don't have to pay some

---------08:57----------
super designer you don't have to pay

---------08:59----------
some genius because all the money you

---------09:00----------
put into designing a website that looks

---------09:02----------
perfect is honestly it's a waste of

---------09:04----------
money I've had sites that were designed

---------09:05----------
for a hundred bucks I've had should I

---------09:07----------
put together myself and I've paid

---------09:09----------
upwards of nine to eighteen thousand

---------09:10----------
dollars to have a website designed I'm

---------09:12----------
not kidding

---------09:12----------
at the end of the day what matters is

---------09:16----------
that you answer those questions like

---------09:17----------
very easily any step everything needs to

---------09:19----------
be easily laid out and accessible so you

---------09:21----------
go back to work on this site and make it

---------09:24----------
so that I can figure out all that

---------09:25----------
without googling I mean without

---------09:27----------
searching around again my website sucks

---------09:29----------
to be clear this site is a steaming

---------09:31----------
piece of but it's a steaming piece

---------09:34----------
of that answers everybody's

---------09:35----------
question at the top bar what we do BAM

---------09:37----------
what we do BAM do I have to pay to

---------09:39----------
figure out if it's wrong no you don't

---------09:41----------
can I send it in if I'm out oh yes I can

---------09:44----------
should I trust this BAM oh I want

---------09:46----------
to contact them and I'm too stupid to

---------09:47----------
see there's a phone number here and a

---------09:48----------
phone number here and a phone number

---------09:50----------
here contact

---------09:56----------
can we please destroy the caps I'm

---------09:58----------
working on DJ Rob William that's kind of

---------10:01----------
low blow low blow I wasn't gonna go

---------10:03----------
there he is the real thing that matters

---------10:05----------
watch this thing one two aah number one

---------10:17----------
on Google

---------10:18----------
number one on Google Places closed wish

---------10:21----------
I was Mac number one number one

---------10:26----------
oh yeah oh yeah

---------10:36----------
I answered one of those here we go can I

---------10:42----------
replace the LA I have all these stupid

---------10:43----------
 ass answers that I wrote a long

---------10:46----------
time ago

---------10:47----------
- all these dumbass questions these

---------10:51----------
aren't useless pages but you know I had

---------10:54----------
a right answers to all these stupid

---------10:56----------
 questions to get up here but

---------10:59----------
these are real answers this is not like

---------11:00----------
a stupid the SEO is page this is here is

---------11:04----------
the price for the board for every single

---------11:06----------
 model that exists and a link to

---------11:08----------
buy it kind of thing that's videos

---------11:20----------
number two what BAM

---------11:25----------
again again I made websites for a living

---------11:29----------
in your website it's great no need to

---------11:30----------
change if it's already working a

---------11:31----------
good-looking thank you one that I yeah

---------11:34----------
is that here's the thing if your website

---------11:36----------
answers everybody's questions which is

---------11:38----------
what I've done here I've tried to answer

---------11:40----------
as many of these questions as humanly

---------11:42----------
possible what you find is that more

---------11:46----------
people will show up I actually have Paul

---------11:48----------
Daniels on my website check it out I

---------11:50----------
tried to give him some SEO juice here

---------11:51----------
Nayland repair macbook repair in

---------11:54----------
australia

---------12:13----------
[Laughter]

---------12:18----------
that was fun I had to get rid of this

---------12:22----------
cuz oh yeah I didn't try to fall Daniel

---------12:25----------
they said Paul Daniels can do this as

---------12:26----------
well but yeah that was that was my side

---------12:29----------
or not Paul Daniels you can tell it's my

---------12:34----------
soldering because I didn't fix one of

---------12:35----------
the traces after putting all that

---------12:36----------
working yeah Paul Daniels let's see if a

---------12:46----------
calf is blown up yet

---------12:55----------
all right what do you guys see now what

---------12:58----------
do you see tell me if you think

---------13:02----------
anything's funny the capacitor on the

---------13:10----------
right has been developing blue balls

---------13:12----------
so this cap that's developed blue balls

---------13:14----------
is most likely the one that's bad

---------13:29----------
as you can see the moment I remove their

---------13:31----------
cap the power supply is now taking zero

---------13:33----------
amps

---------13:57----------
thank you for valuable advice less logo

---------13:59----------
well not just less logo but you need to

---------14:01----------
do here's the thing every time you get a

---------14:03----------
customer you need to ask why they chose

---------14:06----------
you

---------14:06----------
what were your questions what were your

---------14:09----------
concerns what were you worried about

---------14:11----------
what were you told what led you to

---------14:13----------
coming here eventually and then once you

---------14:16----------
figure out what their concerns were once

---------14:18----------
you figure out what they were curious

---------14:20----------
about you're going to make that the

---------14:21----------
front page of your website every single

---------14:25----------
paranoid concern a customer has you're

---------14:28----------
going to answer on the front page of

---------14:30----------
your site everything a customer tells

---------14:33----------
you that is relevant to why they would

---------14:38----------
use you instead of someone else you're

---------14:40----------
going to mention on your site your site

---------14:43----------
needs to answer all of that your site is

---------14:45----------
not about what you think is important

---------14:46----------
it's about what the customer thinks is

---------14:49----------
important and you can usually tell when

---------14:52----------
a website is written by the owner versus

---------14:54----------
a customer because when the owner writes

---------14:56----------
the website they sit down and they think

---------14:58----------
to themselves what the am I

---------15:00----------
supposed to write here I guess and

---------15:01----------
supposed to describe myself I started in

---------15:04----------
this year and I had a great passion for

---------15:06----------
computers and I decided to bring the

---------15:09----------
high quality of my passion to my loyal

---------15:11----------
and loving customers you can tell it's

---------15:14----------
not even like it's bad it's just it was

---------15:16----------
written by the owner for the owner

---------15:18----------
because the rather than written for the

---------15:20----------
customer and the way you write your

---------15:22----------
website for your customer is you see as

---------15:25----------
you implement all the things that they

---------15:28----------
regularly ask you about while you're on

---------15:31----------
the phone with them when you're dealing

---------15:32----------
with them in person all the Paranoid

---------15:34----------
kind of questions you're gonna take all

---------15:36----------
those little concerns and questions and

---------15:38----------
put them immediately in the beginning so

---------15:41----------
if someone shows up and says oh so do

---------15:44----------
you do liquid damage repair your site

---------15:46----------
just failed your site failed because

---------15:48----------
they don't know if you do liquid damage

---------15:50----------
repair so you're going to put on the top

---------15:51----------
of your site liquid damage repair oh do

---------15:56----------
you date a recovery okay now you have

---------15:58----------
something else to list dude is it you

---------16:00----------
charge only if it's successful or do you

---------16:03----------
charge anyway no are we only charge if

---------16:05----------
it's successful okay no bench fee free

---------16:08----------
estimate

---------16:14----------
I got a tinier needle for my flux so

---------16:16----------
I'll likely be using less of it hip not

---------16:21----------
says thank you for teaching me the

---------16:23----------
difference between smearing my [ __ ]

---------16:24----------
and cleaning it I have since changed how

---------16:26----------
I wipe my ass because of you thanks man

---------16:31----------
and twitch still won't give me an

---------16:33----------
agreement where I'm able to stream to

---------16:36----------
youtube and twitch at the same time even

---------16:38----------
with this quality content that I'm

---------16:40----------
giving the viewers teaching people

---------16:46----------
that'll wipe their ass here man I'm

---------16:48----------
trying address the customers pain points

---------16:50----------
exactly Chuck you know what I'm gonna

---------16:53----------
give you some assigned reading so James

---------16:56----------
you still there you're gonna read a book

---------16:59----------
called start with know by Jim camp

---------17:02----------
before my next dream read the book in

---------17:07----------
its entirety

---------17:25----------
[Applause]

---------17:40----------
all right so we're now in the kilohms

---------17:42----------
range

---------17:43----------
[Applause]

---------17:48----------
and because we're in the killer alma's

---------17:49----------
range it's safe to assume that the short

---------17:51----------
circuit is gone now the short circuit is

---------17:54----------
gone I should be able to plug this in

---------17:57----------
and get an image on my screen let's see

---------18:00----------
if that's the case did the cap goes

---------18:05----------
short-circuit because a piece of you

---------18:06----------
flexing or what the cap wound

---------18:08----------
short-circuit because it was inside of

---------18:10----------
an alcohol product it couldn't live up

---------18:12----------
to its full potential so it got blue

---------18:14----------
balls and exploded what you wanted a

---------18:16----------
different answer what do you think this

---------18:20----------
says eevblog

---------18:20----------
right look like an engineer to you

---------18:23----------
that's the best you're gonna get now

---------18:26----------
GTFO backlight fixed

---------18:42----------
another working macbook that's it for

---------18:48----------
today and as always i hope you learned

---------18:51----------
something i'll see you all in the next

---------18:53----------
video

---------18:54----------
fine
