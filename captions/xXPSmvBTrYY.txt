---------00:00----------
all right so today I'm gonna be going

---------00:01----------
over an eight to zero 29:36 logic board

---------00:03----------
that goes into a 2011 13-inch MacBook

---------00:06----------
Pro we're gonna go over what's wrong

---------00:08----------
with it what happened to it - and the

---------00:11----------
very sad attempt at fixing it that was

---------00:13----------
made by an $80.00 eBay person so by the

---------00:16----------
way I'm not against people who make

---------00:17----------
mistakes because I make a lot of

---------00:19----------
mistakes and that's how I learn

---------00:20----------
what I but what I do like is making fun

---------00:23----------
of the combination of arrogance and

---------00:24----------
ignorance when that results in a poor

---------00:27----------
job or when somebody is really really do

---------00:30----------
valuing what we do and then while

---------00:32----------
devaluing it they something up

---------00:34----------
because it's exactly like this this is

---------00:36----------
why this is $80 like I get a lot of

---------00:39----------
people who come in asking this because

---------00:40----------
they'll see this this and this probably

---------00:41----------
why because they see that motherboard

---------00:43----------
repair on eBay cost $80 and I'm not

---------00:47----------
talking about connector replacement I'm

---------00:48----------
not talking about backlight issue I'm

---------00:50----------
talking about honest-to-god full service

---------00:53----------
macbook logic board repair for $80 and

---------00:56----------
free shipping and you know this kind of

---------00:58----------
reminds me of a honeymooners quote

---------00:59----------
because this thing wound up here I

---------01:01----------
googled the address and the name and

---------01:03----------
everything cuz it seemed familiar to

---------01:04----------
figure out that this was somebody was

---------01:05----------
offering the service on eBay for 80

---------01:07----------
bucks it reminds me of this honeymooners

---------01:09----------
quote I'm not sure if any of you guys

---------01:10----------
watched the honeymooners it was after I

---------01:12----------
think he got fired from the bus company

---------01:13----------
or something and he's complaining to his

---------01:16----------
wife and he goes aggravation 101

---------01:18----------
aggravations everyday driving a bus in

---------01:20----------
the summertime diet from the heat and

---------01:21----------
the wintertime freezing from the cold

---------01:23----------
all kinds of weather through the rain

---------01:24----------
the snow and the sleet you know that

---------01:26----------
sign they have in the post office the

---------01:27----------
mail gets through no matter what kind of

---------01:29----------
weather you know why because the mailman

---------01:30----------
rides with me that's why and that's kind

---------01:32----------
of what I feel like saying to a lot of

---------01:33----------
these people when they're like why you

---------01:35----------
know the you know how this eighty dollar

---------01:38----------
motherboard repair person gets by when

---------01:39----------
he can't figure it out or he up

---------01:41----------
your board he sends it here and I and

---------01:43----------
I'm gonna charge him full retail rate

---------01:45----------
because he's not a wholesale customer I

---------01:47----------
digress let's go over what's actually

---------01:49----------
wrong with this thing and let's go over

---------01:51----------
what went on to fix it so here's the

---------01:53----------
thing again I make a lot of these

---------01:55----------
mistakes but at the end of the day

---------01:56----------
you'll see cuz I uploaded a few keyboard

---------01:59----------
videos like this at the end of the day I

---------02:00----------
catch it this this is just the sad sack

---------02:04----------
over here so let's go over so again it

---------02:06----------
wasn't seeing the keyboard so you got

---------02:09----------
the keyboard connector though it got

---------02:10----------
semi replaced I say semi because

---------02:13----------
well look at this for the keyboard

---------02:16----------
connector got replaced but there's no

---------02:18----------
keyboard that resistor got kind of

---------02:21----------
knocked off no keyboard we were placed

---------02:23----------
you 5701 which is the keyboard

---------02:25----------
controller chip and oh my god there's

---------02:27----------
still no keyboard what are we going to

---------02:28----------
do

---------02:29----------
well the first thing that you should be

---------02:30----------
doing here is using a brain what type of

---------02:32----------
device is the keyboard on this machine

---------02:34----------
if you read the schematic you realize

---------02:36----------
that the keyboard is a USB device now

---------02:38----------
the keyboard is going to communicate

---------02:39----------
with this chip and this chip pretty much

---------02:42----------
turns it into a USB signal that can be

---------02:43----------
accepted by a USB controller hub so

---------02:46----------
let's go over the block diagram in the

---------02:47----------
schematic now we're here it's telling me

---------02:48----------
how everything goes right so this should

---------02:50----------
give me a couple of hints so where is

---------02:58----------
keyboard I don't give a about

---------03:01----------
Windows 10 go away

---------03:04----------
all right so trackpad keyboard goes

---------03:07----------
through this connector J 5800 and J 5713

---------03:11----------
that ghetto is to you 5701

---------03:14----------
u 5701 goes to the USB hub - that's on

---------03:17----------
page 24 which is u 2650 and that then

---------03:20----------
goes to the PCH which takes all the

---------03:22----------
information from the USB devices and

---------03:24----------
pretty much manages it let's check this

---------03:30----------
out let's check out u 2650 here we go

---------03:38----------
we're on a USB page USB hub so you have

---------03:43----------
two USB hubs you have u 2600 and you

---------03:46----------
2650 so this hub down here you 2650 you

---------03:56----------
2650 is responsible for let's see

---------04:05----------
bluetooth trackpad keyboard external a

---------04:09----------
an SD card slot you 2600 is responsible

---------04:15----------
for the other externals so this computer

---------04:20----------
has multiple USB ports on it

---------04:24----------
so let's see what these go to so USB

---------04:27----------
underscore ext B underscore n so this

---------04:36----------
the top chip goes to JIT a J 46:10 which

---------04:42----------
is a USB port so let's write this down

---------04:52----------
because as I like to say all the time I

---------04:53----------
have a very very bad memory

---------04:55----------
so J 46:10 first USB hub now the USB hub

---------05:08----------
responsible for the trackpad and the

---------05:09----------
keyboard goes to USB external a and P

---------05:14----------
let's see where that goes to that goes

---------05:25----------
to this which then goes to J 4600 just

---------05:34----------
in case you missed that that's where USB

---------05:38----------
X a goes to it goes to this chip and

---------05:40----------
that chip goes to this USB port J 4600

---------05:46----------
so let's write that down J 4600 USB hub

---------05:52----------
that keyboard is controlled from so now

---------05:57----------
we're gonna go over to the board view

---------06:00----------
delete this.j 4600 J 46:10 alright so

---------06:11----------
these are the two USB ports and again I

---------06:12----------
wrote this down because I got a really

---------06:14----------
bad memory and it comes to these short

---------06:15----------
term remembering of numbers so J 4600 is

---------06:19----------
the USB port that is attached to the USB

---------06:24----------
hub that may be good and J 46:10 is

---------06:26----------
connected J 46 huh see I'm bad with this

---------06:29----------
J 46:10 is the first USB hub J 4600 is

---------06:33----------
connected to the USB hub that the

---------06:34----------
keyboard in the trackpad goes to so what

---------06:37----------
you

---------06:37----------
could do to try to figure this issue out

---------06:39----------
before you even open the screws in the

---------06:41----------
bottom of the computer you can have this

---------06:43----------
motherboard diagnosed as whether it's a

---------06:45----------
keyboard issue or a keyboard controller

---------06:46----------
chip issue or a USB hub or PCH issue so

---------06:51----------
I'm gonna take this board I'm gonna put

---------06:52----------
the memory and the fan in it

---------07:05----------
might as well screw one or two of the

---------07:07----------
heatsink screws in I want to burn it now

---------07:26----------
I'm gonna unplug the internal drive what

---------07:28----------
sucks about this old pile of is

---------07:30----------
that it doesn't have USB 3 it only as

---------07:32----------
USB 2 which is totally gonna defeat the

---------07:34----------
purpose of the fact that I keep a

---------07:36----------
crucial SSD here with an operating

---------07:38----------
system with tools on it just so that one

---------07:40----------
I want to test things that loads fast

---------07:42----------
it's gonna load like because of the

---------07:43----------
USB to chicken I'm not even gonna plug

---------07:47----------
anything any keyboard or trackpad or any

---------07:49----------
of that in what I'm gonna do is I'm

---------07:52----------
gonna plug the screen in battery and

---------07:56----------
then I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna

---------07:59----------
plug it into the regular USB port so the

---------08:01----------
regular USB port again let me just check

---------08:03----------
my thing ok J 46:10 so according to my

---------08:07----------
board view J 46:10 is this USB port here

---------08:11----------
now I've unplugged to the hard drive so

---------08:13----------
it's not gonna try to boot off of the

---------08:15----------
internal hard drive the fan is spinning

---------08:21----------
it's turning on now what I want to see

---------08:23----------
over here what I'm looking for is to see

---------08:26----------
if that USB hub is working so what I'm

---------08:28----------
doing here is I'm narrowing down whether

---------08:30----------
it's a USB hub issue or a PCH issue so

---------08:33----------
while I'm waiting for the slow piece of

---------08:35----------
crap to boot over USB - let me show you

---------08:38----------
what I'm talking about on the schematic

---------08:56----------
so the trackpad and the keyboard

---------08:59----------
controller talks to the trackpad on the

---------09:03----------
keyboard over here this talks to the USB

---------09:06----------
hub and the USB hub talks to the PCH

---------09:16----------
erase this so the trackpad and the

---------09:20----------
keyboard talk to this keyboard

---------09:22----------
controller chip that I showed you that

---------09:23----------
the guy replaced that talks to this USB

---------09:26----------
hub and then this talks to the PCH if

---------09:28----------
neither of my USB ports work most likely

---------09:31----------
I have a PCH issue this is the chip that

---------09:33----------
talks to the CPU but controls the things

---------09:35----------
like SATA PCI Express computer turning

---------09:38----------
on because all the USB hubs talk to the

---------09:42----------
PCH right

---------09:43----------
if one USB port works like this one but

---------09:47----------
then this USB port doesn't work then I

---------09:49----------
have a USB hub issue if none of the USB

---------09:52----------
ports work I could have two USB hub

---------09:53----------
issues which is unlikely or a PCH issue

---------09:56----------
which is more likely if all the USB hubs

---------09:58----------
work but I have no trackpad or keyboard

---------10:01----------
then it's most likely something to do

---------10:03----------
with the trackpad keyboard circuit so

---------10:05----------
now that I've gotten that out of the way

---------10:07----------
let's see how my machine has booted with

---------10:09----------
the first USB port as you can see it's

---------10:12----------
booting slow as because again we're

---------10:14----------
booting over USB 2 and also since I

---------10:17----------
didn't plug in the trackpad in the

---------10:18----------
keyboard it's clocking itself down but

---------10:19----------
clearly that USB hub works it sees that

---------10:22----------
there's a drive there and it's trying to

---------10:23----------
boot off of it which means that you know

---------10:26----------
it's not totally destroyed again without

---------10:28----------
the trackpad plugged in that's gonna run

---------10:30----------
slow and it's booting over USB 2 now

---------10:33----------
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try the

---------10:35----------
other USB hub so I actually forgot which

---------10:38----------
one I started with thank god I wrote it

---------10:39----------
down so I tried J 46:10 which is over

---------10:42----------
here now when I tried J 4600 which is

---------10:44----------
the USB hope that the keyboard is

---------10:45----------
controlled by O which is J 4600 that's

---------10:48----------
the USB hub that is next to the SD card

---------10:50----------
slot wait is plug the battery in and I'm

---------10:55----------
gonna plug my charger and to turn the

---------10:57----------
computer on

---------11:02----------
and I'm gonna wait let's see what

---------11:05----------
happens is it gonna try to boot into the

---------11:07----------
operating system or is it gonna be

---------11:10----------
screwed up so on my crappy little two

---------11:15----------
dollar eBay junky USB 2 too sad a thing

---------11:19----------
I have a red light so at the very least

---------11:21----------
it is providing power now let's see if

---------11:23----------
data is working at the USB hub not

---------11:35----------
booting yet

---------11:49----------
I should really just put this down so

---------11:52----------
that you can watch along with me Oh what

---------12:02----------
do you know one of our USB hubs ain't

---------12:05----------
working right so now let's take a look

---------12:07----------
and see what's going on again this

---------12:08----------
problem did not require soldering to

---------12:11----------
diagnose it did not require replacing a

---------12:13----------
chip but did not require replacing a

---------12:14----------
connector this is the problem with

---------12:16----------
monkey-see monkey-do thinking or should

---------12:18----------
I say a lack of thinking and monkey-see

---------12:21----------
monkey-do behavior keyboard not working

---------12:23----------
me replace connector me replace

---------12:25----------
connector and still no work meera plays

---------12:27----------
keyboard controller chip why are you not

---------12:28----------
thinking to come up with a solution for

---------12:30----------
why this doesn't work oh because you do

---------12:32----------
this for $80 in exactly like billion

---------12:34----------
that is what you get when you

---------12:37----------
send this thing off to somebody's gonna

---------12:38----------
do it for 80 bucks you think you're

---------12:40----------
getting somebody to think for $80 no all

---------12:44----------
right so let's go over the schematic

---------12:46----------
again and go to that area so this USB

---------12:53----------
hub is you 2650 oh I'm in the wrong

---------13:02----------
thing I want to see where it is

---------13:06----------
okay USB hub is over here so this year

---------13:09----------
is you 2650 hi corrosion

---------13:19----------
hello corrosion hello actual cause of

---------13:25----------
problem again this diagnosis did not

---------13:28----------
require opening the computer yes the

---------13:31----------
computer is open because it was sent in

---------13:32----------
for a motherboard repair but this was

---------13:34----------
clearly obviously diagnosable without

---------13:37----------
actually taking screws out of the laptop

---------14:00----------
okay here donor board you're a

---------14:09----------
nice-lookin donor board actually no

---------14:11----------
you're not you're the one that as is

---------14:14----------
your own short to ground on everything

---------14:16----------
but your USB hub actually looks very

---------14:19----------
nice so I'll steal you my hack go on

---------14:25----------
flamethrower mode I got it on this seven

---------14:27----------
and a half and air is at 16 air filter

---------14:32----------
on no up breathing here

---------14:42----------
so for all you people asking what

---------14:44----------
temperature my hat goes on it's on seven

---------14:45----------
and a half and my air is at sixteen you

---------14:48----------
want to know what that is in Fahrenheit

---------14:49----------
or Celsius I have no idea

---------14:51----------
just live with non knowing it's hot

---------14:54----------
enough that's what I care about

---------15:11----------
goodbye eBay is just such a

---------15:21----------
cesspool it's just it's all price it's

---------15:24----------
nobody gives a about quality like

---------15:26----------
every I just almost everything that sold

---------15:28----------
on eBay is complete garbage basis it's

---------15:33----------
not a quality based marketplace

---------16:07----------
you may think that's too much side or my

---------16:09----------
point is not to have a lot of solder on

---------16:11----------
the pads

---------16:11----------
the idea is to pick up the old it old

---------16:14----------
lead lead-free solder and sell it at

---------16:17----------
gtfo

---------16:51----------
too much solder on the center pad

---------17:00----------
Oh oh that was awful

---------17:06----------
but what I did right there was very $80

---------17:09----------
he person on eBay of me

---------17:12----------
okay let's catch the little solder ball

---------17:14----------
that ran away you Inc let's get rid of

---------17:22----------
that mess

---------17:38----------
what I'm

---------17:45----------
whoa bigger mess

---------18:28----------
my trademark never soldered on straight

---------18:32----------
chip

---------18:47----------
all righty what do you think I'm gonna

---------18:54----------
get working USB workin keyboard working

---------19:01----------
mouse or junk let's see

---------19:18----------
you know let's inspire some confidence

---------19:21----------
here that I got it right I'm gonna turn

---------19:22----------
off the hakko and the air filter because

---------19:24----------
the hot air station takes about a minute

---------19:26----------
before it gets hot I'm confident that

---------19:29----------
I'd rather to save the energy I know I

---------19:34----------
fixed this

---------19:35----------
I don't need actually I don't because

---------19:40----------
this is not my keyboard connector

---------19:43----------
keyboard controller chip

---------19:45----------
ah there's flux everywhere

---------19:50----------
gross disgusting I hate flux everywhere

---------19:55----------
good thing the bathroom is next to my

---------19:58----------
office nasty puke

---------20:27----------
yeah I hate getting honed by flux

---------20:38----------
you

---------20:40----------
I still don't want to be touching this

---------20:43----------
not only is

---------20:45----------
 that's just a really it's a one of

---------20:47----------
those computers this is generally dirty

---------20:49----------
all around yeah disgusting it's even

---------20:57----------
smelly it's one of those things where

---------20:59----------
you can almost smell like the the

---------21:02----------
unshowered for a six year person that

---------21:05----------
owns it and you guys who do you know you

---------21:08----------
guys are don't do this for a living can

---------21:09----------
say that like I'm just being an [ __ ]

---------21:11----------
but you people who do this for a living

---------21:13----------
you know what I'm talking about when I

---------21:15----------
say that the device smells like the end

---------21:18----------
user in a really bad way you know what

---------21:22----------
I'm talking about all right

---------21:35----------
all right now remember before not only

---------21:38----------
did the keyboard not work but that USB

---------21:40----------
port didn't work now I'm even I know the

---------21:42----------
keyboard works because I held down

---------21:43----------
option and it brings me to the screen

---------21:45----------
where I get to select the boot device so

---------21:47----------
if I hold down option it brings me to

---------21:48----------
that screen that allows me to select the

---------21:49----------
boot device and I fayed enter is able to

---------21:52----------
see that boot device which is a USB boot

---------21:54----------
device and boot off of it which means

---------21:57----------
that it's done it does have to get

---------21:59----------
cleaned up because the board it's again

---------22:01----------
this whole this whole machine is a

---------22:03----------
little a little $80 on eBay ish for me

---------22:07----------
oh yeah thank God I have a lot of soap

---------22:11----------
in here but yeah it's I gotta get gloves

---------22:14----------
I know I have them here and I like

---------22:16----------
wearing them when I'm working on nasty

---------22:17----------
crap but for some reason I just I didn't

---------22:19----------
wear them it's it's great when you take

---------22:21----------
it's great to feel like I'm touching

---------22:22----------
this nasty stuff and I don't care

---------22:24----------
because I'm protected that's the beauty

---------22:26----------
of gloves which I really should just

---------22:28----------
remember where mine are because I know I

---------22:29----------
have them and I really got to start

---------22:31----------
wearing them with how nasty some of this

---------22:33----------
crap is but yeah this is it so before

---------22:36----------
you had no keyboard no trackpad now you

---------22:38----------
have keyboard trackpad USB and again

---------22:39----------
it's just a matter of using your brain

---------22:41----------
you know if you don't don't replace

---------22:44----------
things don't guess come up with a plan

---------22:46----------
and try to come up with ways to narrow

---------22:48----------
down what the problem is and just think

---------22:51----------
every step of the way ask questions they

---------22:52----------
ask lots of questions ask stupid

---------22:54----------
questions because sometimes stupid

---------22:56----------
questions will lead you to a smart

---------22:57----------
answer but if you don't ask any

---------22:59----------
questions and you just start just going

---------23:00----------
hmm okay ding ding ding ding and this

---------23:03----------
replacing without thinking you'll

---------23:05----------
just be so you need to think

---------23:06----------
before you replace something if you

---------23:08----------
don't think before you replace something

---------23:09----------
I can almost guarantee you that you will

---------23:11----------
regularly get owned now time to send a

---------23:15----------
bill for $225 to somebody that I know is

---------23:18----------
only making 80 bucks off of this that's

---------23:20----------
gonna feel good
