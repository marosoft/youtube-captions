---------00:00----------
hi so today we're gonna be going over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero 2936 board that has no

---------00:03----------
green light on the charger and it also

---------00:05----------
doesn't turn on so we're gonna go into a

---------00:07----------
few couple basic measurements to see

---------00:09----------
where the problem is where it lies so

---------00:11----------
that I can get an idea where to start so

---------00:13----------
let's just open up the schematic for it

---------00:14----------
and hope that this time I finally

---------00:16----------
learned how to use open broadcaster so

---------00:18----------
that the scenes don't change and do

---------00:19----------
stupid things for no reason okay so

---------00:23----------
we're yeah okay so what I say to do is

---------00:25----------
you should check your power rails to see

---------00:27----------
what's present and what's not present so

---------00:30----------
I scroll down to the power rail section

---------00:32----------
and it's also important to open a board

---------00:41----------
view so you may look at the schematic

---------00:42----------
and go how do I find that stuff on the

---------00:43----------
board you will one of the big

---------00:45----------
misconceptions out there is that

---------00:47----------
everybody who does this for a living as

---------00:48----------
psychic and just knows where it is

---------00:49----------
because we're geniuses and that's not

---------00:51----------
true we're just idiots that use software

---------00:52----------
that tell us where the stuff is and the

---------00:55----------
reason this is important is because a

---------00:56----------
lot of websites will sell you the

---------00:57----------
schematic without selling it the board

---------00:59----------
view which is just a really shitty thing

---------01:01----------
to do so if you ever bought a schematic

---------01:03----------
without a board view you need to find

---------01:05----------
the person that sold you that schematic

---------01:06----------
without a board view and you know beat

---------01:09----------
their face and their file a PayPal claim

---------01:11----------
filing a PayPal claim is probably the

---------01:12----------
more civilized thing to do so first

---------01:14----------
thing we look for is pp 3 v 4 to

---------01:15----------
underscore G 3 hot yes you should be

---------01:17----------
able to see the camera kind of now there

---------01:22----------
we go so you can't see the top of my

---------01:24----------
head but who cares about the top of my

---------01:25----------
head we're looking for the multimeter on

---------01:26----------
the board top my head is completely

---------01:28----------
worthless

---------01:29----------
so we're gonna measure for pp 3 before

---------01:31----------
to here we should plug the MagSafe in

---------01:37----------
before we measure for pp 3 v 4 tail

---------01:39----------
button didn't that be smart ok so

---------01:42----------
you plug that down we have no green

---------01:45----------
light in the charger PP 3 V 4 2 is

---------01:50----------
nothing because we're in resistance mode

---------01:52----------
by the way if I was using a cheap

---------01:53----------
multimeter instead of a fluke that would

---------01:55----------
be dead right now

---------01:56----------
see so one dumb move in the fluke pays

---------01:59----------
for itself 3.42 volts it's not really

---------02:02----------
focused on it because it's at the facial

---------02:04----------
focus but you can see it's 3.42 volts

---------02:06----------
then we measure for PP brush g3 hot at 0

---------02:09----------
volts so there we know we have a problem

---------02:10----------
so we're gonna start going through that

---------02:11----------
circuit and looking for what's wrong so

---------02:13----------
I am

---------02:13----------
the charger and I put the multimeter

---------02:14----------
into diode modes that I can measure for

---------02:16----------
a shorter ground on that rail I'm gonna

---------02:18----------
take the red probe of my multimeter and

---------02:20----------
I'm gonna put the red probe of my

---------02:21----------
multimeter on ground and then I'm gonna

---------02:24----------
put the black probe of my multimeter on

---------02:25----------
a spot on the board or PP bus g3 hot

---------02:27----------
shows up and this tells me that I don't

---------02:30----------
have a short to ground a short to ground

---------02:33----------
to be this zero voltage drop to ground

---------02:35----------
that is not a short to ground so what

---------02:39----------
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna look

---------02:41----------
around that circuit and try to get an

---------02:42----------
idea for what looks nasty what may be

---------02:44----------
nasty with me measure nasty but the

---------02:46----------
first things first is to actually look

---------02:47----------
at it because I don't feel like

---------02:48----------
measuring stuff and well I'm lazy and I

---------02:50----------
got a lot of stuff to do I have a long

---------02:52----------
day ahead of me and I got a lot of

---------02:54----------
things I want to do and one of them is

---------02:55----------
not staring at a board and measuring

---------02:57----------
stuff all day this is the ISL 65:9 area

---------03:21----------
it doesn't look very nice so what looks

---------03:25----------
funny to you here can you tell me what

---------03:27----------
looks funny

---------03:28----------
so the pins that look funny I'm gonna

---------03:30----------
try to point them out you tell me if you

---------03:32----------
agree this looks funny

---------03:36----------
this looks funny and also this over here

---------03:42----------
this does not look very nice see how

---------03:44----------
this is a nice shiny side of a resistor

---------03:45----------
shiny side of a resistor sodomized and

---------03:48----------
 side of the resistor shiny

---------03:50----------
capacitor over here shiny side of the

---------03:53----------
capacitor sodomized and skull-fucked

---------03:55----------
side of the capacitor that's no good so

---------03:56----------
let's try to see what that part of the

---------03:58----------
circuit actually does and let's try to

---------03:59----------
get an idea of what happened to cause

---------04:02----------
that to look nasty so the whole idea is

---------04:04----------
not to ask for a story from the

---------04:06----------
customers because you think of your

---------04:08----------
customers are not gonna tell you that oh

---------04:10----------
this board had a power spike through PP

---------04:12----------
18 v5 underscore s Oh or something like

---------04:14----------
that they're just gonna say that I

---------04:15----------
spilled on or even or in the case

---------04:18----------
of New York customers Andy's village

---------04:20----------
customers it's gonna be to do spill

---------04:21----------
something on it and then you open it

---------04:25----------
it's filled with a green and it's

---------04:26----------
Oh

---------04:27----------
you mean the orange juice that I spilled

---------04:28----------
on it yesterday or why didn't you say so

---------04:30----------
and it's like you know but anyway let's

---------04:33----------
move on and look through the circuit to

---------04:34----------
see what that stuff is and what it does

---------04:36----------
so the points on here that look nasty

---------04:38----------
let's just zoom in on those and let's

---------04:40----------
see if the software will allow me to

---------04:41----------
this is that software from Windows

---------04:43----------
3.1 days so every single time I maximize

---------04:45----------
the window but I with the window

---------04:47----------
and move it around I have to reopen the

---------04:49----------
board view because it just it's made for

---------04:51----------
a Windows 3.1 computer and we don't get

---------04:55----------
to get better software we're not

---------04:56----------
actually even supposed to have this

---------04:57----------
stuff because it's a bigger you know

---------04:58----------
that whole you to people who try to

---------05:00----------
fix Apple products is going on so that

---------05:02----------
pin look nasty this one looked nasty and

---------05:07----------
then let's see in terms of resistors

---------05:10----------
this one over here look nasty so let's

---------05:17----------
look at the schematic and see what's

---------05:18----------
going on there I actually click the

---------05:24----------
wrong thing or is our 7021 that looked

---------05:26----------
nasty nazi 7021 let's see so charger a

---------05:30----------
gate that pin looked nasty that's going

---------05:33----------
to open this and let the adapter voltage

---------05:36----------
through the machine and this over here

---------05:39----------
looked nasty no I don't really have a

---------05:41----------
way to measure a pin on you 7000 I could

---------05:44----------
measure its resistance to ground and

---------05:46----------
compare that resistance to ground with

---------05:48----------
another board but that would require

---------05:51----------
getting another board that works what I

---------05:53----------
can measure is our 70 21 this I can

---------05:55----------
measure instantly so which one I measure

---------05:57----------
first is not really a function of what

---------05:58----------
makes sense to measure first it's really

---------06:00----------
about what's right in front of me and

---------06:01----------
what I could do instantly to try to rule

---------06:03----------
out my problem which is our 70 21 now

---------06:05----------
that's supposed to be 10 ohms so when I

---------06:07----------
measure our 7021 let's see what I get

---------06:10----------
I'm gonna measure our 70 21 can you see

---------06:14----------
it over here yeah you can see it over

---------06:16----------
there so that whole thing of me dropping

---------06:17----------
the multimeter was all for nothing okay

---------06:19----------
I can move the microscope back a little

---------06:21----------
there you go all right

---------06:25----------
so we're gonna measure our 70 21 30

---------06:33----------
kilohms and then up to infinite to

---------06:36----------
kilohms

---------06:37----------
1.5 kilohms okay and let's just measure

---------06:39----------
the one under it for shits and giggles

---------06:44----------
700 kilo ohms okay let's talk a little

---------06:49----------
bit about what those do and what they're

---------06:50----------
for and what their purpose is in the

---------06:51----------
circuit and why we care that they look

---------06:53----------
 up this is part of a current

---------06:55----------
sensing circuit the way this works is

---------06:58----------
that the voltage from the charger is

---------06:59----------
going to come through this shunt

---------07:00----------
resistor this is a 0.02 ohm resistor

---------07:03----------
there is virtually no power drop across

---------07:05----------
this resistor because it's resistance is

---------07:07----------
very very very very very very very very

---------07:09----------
low however there is gonna be a really

---------07:11----------
small voltage drop just because it is a

---------07:14----------
resistor and just because it is

---------07:15----------
resisting power going through it and

---------07:16----------
that voltage drop is gonna be really

---------07:18----------
really low something like 0.0001 volts

---------07:21----------
it's gonna be something that's

---------07:22----------
ridiculous and negligible over the

---------07:23----------
course of the circuit however one

---------07:24----------
interesting part about this resistor is

---------07:26----------
that the voltage drop across the

---------07:28----------
resistor is going to be proportional to

---------07:30----------
the amount of power the amount of

---------07:32----------
current that's flowing through the

---------07:33----------
circuit so the more amperage this

---------07:35----------
circuit is using the more amperage the

---------07:37----------
system is using the more the voltage

---------07:40----------
drop is going to be so what the ISL 65:9

---------07:44----------
is doing is it as a resistor going to

---------07:46----------
the top of this resistor and this other

---------07:47----------
resistor here going to the bottom of

---------07:49----------
this resistor so it's what the ISL 65:9

---------07:51----------
is doing is it's reading the power on

---------07:53----------
the top and the bottom of this resistor

---------07:55----------
and what it's doing by looking at those

---------07:57----------
two voltages is it's figuring out how

---------07:58----------
much amperage the system is using based

---------08:00----------
on the voltage drop across this resistor

---------08:02----------
which allows it to see that it's

---------08:04----------
actually charging which allows it to see

---------08:06----------
that that how much amperage the system

---------08:08----------
is using so let's say the charger is

---------08:09----------
using 15 amps it's gonna know oh my god

---------08:11----------
this charge is always opposed to b4

---------08:13----------
using five amps the charge is probably

---------08:14----------
on fire I should turn off the system

---------08:16----------
whereas if it's only using one or two

---------08:18----------
M's it knows that it's fine and can

---------08:19----------
continue this is called high side

---------08:21----------
current sensing and it's a basic

---------08:23----------
protection feature basic thing that's

---------08:25----------
built in a most modern circuitry and

---------08:26----------
because our 7021 and our 70 22 or not

---------08:29----------
what they're supposed to be that it's

---------08:31----------
incredibly up so we're gonna I'm

---------08:33----------
gonna replace those two and I'm also

---------08:35----------
gonna replace C 70 20 over here because

---------08:37----------
that may be up as well and after

---------08:39----------
replacing all those things we're gonna

---------08:40----------
see if it works we're gonna see if we

---------08:41----------
need to replace the is l6 to 5.9 or if

---------08:44----------
the is l6 to 59 is actually usable I

---------08:46----------
have a feeling

---------08:47----------
we're gonna have to replace the il-62 59

---------08:49----------
because there are some other areas of it

---------08:50----------
that don't inspire confidence that don't

---------08:52----------
really look great and we're gonna look

---------08:54----------
at those right now I just want to make

---------08:55----------
sure that you can see what it is that

---------08:56----------
I'm looking at and let's just take a

---------08:58----------
look over here and show you what it is

---------09:00----------
that I don't have confidence in so when

---------09:03----------
I go over to the ISO 65:9 area there's

---------09:05----------
also this particular pin that just

---------09:07----------
doesn't really look nice it doesn't

---------09:08----------
strike me as something that I want to

---------09:09----------
keep on my motherboard yeah see that's

---------09:16----------
that's just kind of nasty it may work it

---------09:18----------
may not I'm not sure let's get the get

---------09:29----------
the microscope looking a little nicer we

---------09:32----------
can replace those two resistors with

---------09:33----------
some new ones okay turn on the air

---------09:39----------
filter don't want to die from inhaling

---------09:42----------
this crap

---------09:48----------
while I'm waiting for my hot air station

---------09:50----------
to get hot see if I can be impatient and

---------09:54----------
remove those resistors and capacitor

---------09:56----------
using pure solder this comes bad this is

---------10:04----------
one of those things that I learned how

---------10:05----------
to do back before I could afford a

---------10:07----------
hot-air station so if you don't have the

---------10:10----------
tools that you need to do your job

---------10:12----------
you'll find yourself coming up with fun

---------10:15----------
ways and creative ways to do your job

---------11:08----------
I don't like the way that looks so that

---------11:10----------
can also go in the trash see what I did

---------11:13----------
there as I didn't test the resistor with

---------11:15----------
the multimeter I tested the resistor

---------11:16----------
with my mind I determined that the

---------11:19----------
resistor was bad by looking at it and

---------11:20----------
seeing that it look like

---------12:13----------
so I have four volts we're making

---------12:16----------
progress four volts is considerably more

---------12:20----------
than zero but I don't want four volts

---------12:23----------
four volts is not good enough for me I

---------12:25----------
want 12 so now I'm gonna make a

---------12:30----------
measurement at another point in the

---------12:31----------
circuit I want to see the 16 volts is

---------12:33----------
actually making its way to the buck

---------12:34----------
converter

---------12:34----------
and this makes the in volts is indeed

---------12:36----------
making its way to the buck converter I

---------12:38----------
still got my green light though

---------12:47----------
let's see charger boot so this is

---------12:50----------
feedback so this is the chip itself near

---------12:51----------
the capacitor go for charger boot

---------12:53----------
anything going to is your home resistor

---------12:55----------
that is then going back to the chip

---------12:57----------
let's see how that measures is that

---------12:59----------
gonna measure properly or is that gonna

---------13:00----------
measure messed up I'm doing something

---------13:09----------
that many people are gonna hate which is

---------13:10----------
using Auto range on the multimeter I

---------13:12----------
know I'm a lazy prick I know I know I

---------13:15----------
know you can make fun of me it's okay

---------13:18----------
you can hate you can hate it's your own

---------13:27----------
close enough does your own so just for

---------13:30----------
the hell of it I'm gonna wind up

---------13:31----------
replacing let's see charger boot and I'm

---------13:34----------
also gonna replace the ISL six to five

---------13:35----------
nine and see if that works

---------13:36----------
so if a 16 volt surge went through that

---------13:38----------
part of the chip I really I have a good

---------13:40----------
feeling that good feeling that the chip

---------13:43----------
itself may have gone bad the ISL is

---------13:46----------
easily killed so let's get rid of it and

---------13:49----------
put a new one on there also one

---------13:56----------
important thing that you should have

---------13:57----------
gotten from the video of the class

---------13:58----------
what's one of the most important things

---------13:59----------
to remember when replacing a qfn package

---------14:01----------
the most important thing to remember is

---------14:03----------
to remember the orientation of the chip

---------14:05----------
unlike some people we don't want to take

---------14:07----------
our chances

---------14:24----------
before I replace the ISL let's just

---------14:26----------
replace this one capacitor in the

---------14:28----------
charger boot circuit see if we get

---------14:32----------
anywhere

---------14:41----------
because I see that nasty red pro point

---------14:44----------
over there and I don't like it

---------14:45----------
Oh sometime when you're stuck at 4 volts

---------14:49----------
that is the problem

---------15:36----------
now we're back down 0.3

---------15:38----------
oh yes try another

---------16:39----------
point one

---------16:40----------
yikes sweating here am i using a good

---------16:47----------
dcn board

---------17:03----------
oh let's try replacing the ISO maybe

---------17:07----------
since it's a bad ship and I heated it I

---------17:09----------
messed it up a little bit

---------18:12----------
one of the things I do is I put the old

---------18:14----------
chip on the desk so that I know the

---------18:16----------
orientation of the new chip that I have

---------18:17----------
to put on and I keep it there

---------18:19----------
so it doesn't fly away actually while

---------18:21----------
the solder is still hot I slam it onto

---------18:23----------
the table I'm sure my desk is not a fan

---------18:28----------
of me constantly burning it but sadly

---------18:31----------
for it it does not have a say in the

---------18:33----------
matter

---------18:41----------
again if I wasn't soldering the chip on

---------18:43----------
sideways I wouldn't be Louis rossmann so

---------18:45----------
let's fix that

---------18:59----------
I was in ripping things off for the

---------19:01----------
board as I started I wouldn't be Louis

---------19:02----------
rossman

---------19:17----------
why being lazy swish to the right tip

---------20:03----------
watch me solder must surely make you

---------20:05----------
sick

---------20:07----------
makes me sick watching you I know that

---------20:09----------
much

---------22:06----------
nasty we can clean that a little later

---------22:12----------
okay we get a green light in the charger

---------22:18----------
and after we get a green light in the

---------22:20----------
charger the fan spins and since the fan

---------22:27----------
spins at this point I'm good

---------22:38----------
and that's that so what happened is

---------22:42----------
there was a spike on the 16 volt rail

---------22:44----------
because of the spike on the 16 volt rail

---------22:47----------
that killed the current sensing

---------22:48----------
resistors despite they went to the

---------22:50----------
current sensing resistors killed the ISL

---------22:51----------
6259

---------22:52----------
and by replacing all the ally of a board

---------22:54----------
that works and that's about it

---------22:56----------
it's how logic reason just the basic

---------23:00----------
understanding of how this stuff works

---------23:01----------
and what to look for helps make it easy
