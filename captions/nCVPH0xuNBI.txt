---------00:00----------
all right so today we're going to be

---------00:02----------
going over how to fix a macbook pro that

---------00:04----------
has USB ports that aren't working we're

---------00:06----------
gonna go over the troubleshooting

---------00:07----------
process that we use to figure out which

---------00:09----------
you know which component may be the one

---------00:11----------
used for that is failing and I'm gonna

---------00:13----------
go over the circuit diagram on the

---------00:15----------
screen over here so let's go over the

---------00:17----------
problem that we're having with this

---------00:18----------
specific MacBook here and also make sure

---------00:21----------
to say hi to Doge and let's throw this

---------00:26----------
on and get started so if I put this on

---------00:29----------
the desk first thing I want to do

---------00:33----------
besides obsessively compulsively clean

---------00:36----------
every single one of those fingerprints

---------00:38----------
off the screen now that we got that out

---------00:47----------
of the way what I want to do when I turn

---------00:49----------
it on is I want to see if it's both USB

---------00:52----------
ports or one USB port so I'm gonna hold

---------00:54----------
down the option key and when I hold down

---------00:56----------
the option key it's going to give me the

---------00:58----------
choices of drives that I can boot into

---------00:59----------
and what I've done here is I've attached

---------01:02----------
an external drive this is a little USB 2

---------01:05----------
SSD thingy this is my SSD over here and

---------01:09----------
as you can see it's not seeing the

---------01:11----------
external drive it's only seeing the

---------01:12----------
internal one and that's with it plugged

---------01:14----------
into the second port the outermost port

---------01:17----------
right up here

---------01:18----------
see it's plugged in now I'm going to

---------01:22----------
unplug that and I'm gonna plug it into

---------01:24----------
the other port and I'm gonna see if I

---------01:27----------
get the same thing and when I show you

---------01:29----------
the circuit diagram you'll get a little

---------01:31----------
bit more of an understanding as to why

---------01:33----------
it is I check it on each port I saw your

---------01:39----------
real dogecoin Jessen I was very jealous

---------01:40----------
and I oh yeah I saw what Dave Jones did

---------01:44----------
on Eevee block with the quick very cool

---------01:48----------
review very cool review I liked him

---------01:52----------
going after they yeah we're going after

---------01:54----------
this Nvidia chip oh yeah I thought that

---------01:57----------
was hilarious I loved it I loved every

---------01:59----------
minute of that review it's I love I like

---------02:04----------
Dave Joneses channel if you're at all

---------02:06----------
interested into anything with

---------02:07----------
electronics you should check out Dave

---------02:09----------
Jones's channel called ee-vie blog if

---------02:11----------
you haven't already but if you're here

---------02:13----------
you probably

---------02:14----------
no it exists anyway so as you can see

---------02:16----------
neither report works and there's a

---------02:18----------
reason that I want one of these ports to

---------02:20----------
work so I'm gonna make the schematic

---------02:22----------
fullscreen and I'm gonna show you why it

---------02:24----------
is I'm trying to narrow it down to

---------02:26----------
whether it's both ports or one port all

---------02:31----------
right so we should have this game attic

---------02:32----------
on the screen ahem-hem

---------02:41----------
really

---------02:42----------
all right it was reset ah there we go

---------02:52----------
okay so let's take a look at the diagram

---------02:56----------
now they used to include a diagram and

---------02:59----------
they stopped including this diagram in

---------03:00----------
the newer models but they included it on

---------03:02----------
everything made before 2013 so our USB

---------03:06----------
ports are going to be over here we have

---------03:07----------
external USB a J 4600 and then we have

---------03:12----------
external USB B J 46:10 now each of these

---------03:18----------
USB ports goes to their own separate USB

---------03:21----------
hub before going to the PCH the PCH is

---------03:25----------
the platform controller hub which is a

---------03:27----------
combination of a Northbridge and

---------03:28----------
Southbridge in one so this deals with

---------03:31----------
all the functions that a Northbridge and

---------03:32----------
Southbridge would have typically dealt

---------03:34----------
with so right over here we have what

---------03:37----------
this USB hub deals with bluetooth which

---------03:39----------
on this machine bluetooth is brought to

---------03:41----------
the PCH via USB it deals with the

---------03:44----------
internal trackpad and keyboard so the

---------03:46----------
internal trackpad and keyboard on this

---------03:47----------
model are USB and it deals with the

---------03:50----------
external port so the first USB hub muxes

---------03:52----------
bluetooth trackpad and keyboard and the

---------03:55----------
USB port the second USB hub deals with

---------03:59----------
the second USB port the webcam the

---------04:04----------
infrared controller so I don't know if

---------04:05----------
any you remember but those old white Mac

---------04:07----------
books used to have that little remote

---------04:08----------
control that you could use to control

---------04:10----------
iTunes that virtually I've never seen

---------04:12----------
anybody use in the ten years I've been

---------04:14----------
doing this as a business but apparently

---------04:16----------
they have the circuitry on this machine

---------04:17----------
for that I don't even know if that

---------04:18----------
remote works here but they've got it and

---------04:21----------
now let's take let's go back over to the

---------04:24----------
schematic so if one poor

---------04:27----------
at work so if like the first port works

---------04:29----------
but the second port doesn't then I can

---------04:31----------
say maybe the issue is with this hub so

---------04:34----------
let's say I try the second USB port and

---------04:36----------
it works but the first one doesn't or if

---------04:39----------
something's going on where the first

---------04:41----------
port works the second one doesn't and my

---------04:44----------
webcam doesn't work now I kind of have a

---------04:46----------
hint okay maybe I should blame the USB

---------04:48----------
hub or if the second USB port and the

---------04:51----------
webcam works but I have no Bluetooth

---------04:52----------
trackpad or keyboard maybe I should

---------04:54----------
blame this USB hub but since both are

---------04:57----------
not working what I have to look at is

---------04:58----------
what do these two both have in common

---------05:00----------
so it's not gonna it's very unlikely

---------05:02----------
that both of these hubs failed at the

---------05:04----------
same time rather what's likely is that

---------05:06----------
something that they both have in common

---------05:07----------
is failed so let's look up what that

---------05:09----------
could be

---------05:09----------
now the first thing that these both have

---------05:11----------
in common is the PCH and I would really

---------05:13----------
hope that the PCH is not what failed

---------05:15----------
because this is a chip with 7 or 900

---------05:18----------
balls really small and then I'm going

---------05:21----------
through that whole nightmare of having

---------05:22----------
to find one that works 40 minutes to

---------05:24----------
take it off and put it back on it's

---------05:26----------
really not something you want to deal

---------05:27----------
with now another thing that I'm gonna

---------05:29----------
check is power so power is what these

---------05:32----------
two may have in common

---------05:33----------
now what you and let me just get the

---------05:35----------
board view up here so that you can see

---------05:38----------
the layout of the board and I'm gonna

---------05:40----------
add that to my window capture here add

---------05:45----------
my there we go BAM

---------05:50----------
I should probably crop that very gonna

---------05:53----------
crop that a little bit

---------06:01----------
land wrecks but I still have this in

---------06:07----------
open board view as land wrecks yeah so

---------06:10----------
we're gonna crop that there we go

---------06:29----------
BAM and make this look good all right so

---------06:36----------
this is my board view software now

---------06:38----------
remember if we were looking at the PDF

---------06:40----------
the USB ports are J 4600 NJ 46:10 so

---------06:47----------
when we go over to the board view we

---------06:53----------
were gonna look J 4,600 J 46:10 and

---------06:58----------
those are these two USB ports on the

---------07:00----------
side of the computer obviously Bob Paul

---------07:03----------
dead you'll see the Fed did I'm sorry

---------07:05----------
Paul I'm sorry I really didn't mean to

---------07:08----------
call you software land Rex that's it

---------07:10----------
intentional he's not happy the alt click

---------07:19----------
drag wasn't working to resize the window

---------07:21----------
it works sometimes but not others Paul

---------07:23----------
anyway I think you should put a dogecoin

---------07:26----------
in this where you draw for calling

---------07:27----------
Paul's baby anyway so if you look here

---------07:32----------
supportin this is this I feel really I

---------07:36----------
feel bad that I've been it's muna Paul

---------07:37----------
if we look here you'll see that pin 1 is

---------07:40----------
PP 5 vs 3 USB so that's as you as you

---------07:43----------
all know you need 5 volts to go to the

---------07:45----------
USB port in order for anything to

---------07:47----------
actually work so let's try to figure out

---------07:49----------
where that comes from

---------07:49----------
so that comes from l4 6 1 5 l 4 6 1 5 is

---------07:57----------
going back to you 4600 and you 4,600

---------08:01----------
appears to be what powers the USB port

---------08:04----------
so let's just take a look at you 4600 on

---------08:06----------
the schematic over here so we're gonna

---------08:08----------
go over to the schematic and go to u

---------08:10----------
4,600 now this says USB port power

---------08:17----------
switch so my one question if you

---------08:19----------
remember what I was talking about before

---------08:20----------
is trying to figure out what it maybe in

---------08:23----------
common between these two USB ports so

---------08:25----------
over here you can see that one thing

---------08:27----------
that's in common between both USB ports

---------08:29----------
is the PCH each of these USB ports USB

---------08:32----------
external a and USB external B have

---------08:35----------
separate hubs so the hubs are not in

---------08:37----------
common but if we look over here at the

---------08:41----------
USB port power switch

---------08:43----------
what you'll see is that it has PP 5 vs 3

---------08:48----------
n so 5 volts goes in and Phi and then we

---------08:53----------
have two separate outputs so one of

---------08:55----------
these outputs goes to L 4 605 which goes

---------09:00----------
to this USB port hey somebody just said

---------09:04----------
some nice very much appreciate your vids

---------09:06----------
as a complete newbie starting out thank

---------09:09----------
you very much I really appreciate that

---------09:10----------
that's that's quite nice yeah and I got

---------09:13----------
to add that thingy to this screen so

---------09:15----------
that I can see that and the second

---------09:18----------
output over here output 2 if you follow

---------09:21----------
the line actually output 2 is goes to

---------09:23----------
this port output 1 the output 1 goes

---------09:27----------
down here to l4 6 1 5 which is the

---------09:30----------
second USB port great job so output 1

---------09:34----------
goes to this USB port to output 2 goes

---------09:39----------
to USB port 1 Apple so you go

---------09:49----------
down here and you can see that the 5

---------09:52----------
volt power supply for each of these USB

---------09:55----------
ports has you 4,600 in common so let's

---------09:57----------
figure out what's going on with you 4600

---------09:59----------
you 4,600 has input output and enable

---------10:06----------
sounds pretty simple right so the whole

---------10:08----------
way that this chip is going to work

---------10:09----------
right here is if it has the enable and

---------10:12----------
do keep in mind that the enables are

---------10:13----------
tied together

---------10:14----------
if DDR reg enable is present and pp5 vs

---------10:18----------
3 is present then we will get our output

---------10:21----------
so but now what I want to do first

---------10:25----------
before anything else let's figure out do

---------10:27----------
we have our output if we don't have her

---------10:28----------
output do we have our input if we ever

---------10:30----------
out if we don't have our output but we

---------10:32----------
have our input is the enable present and

---------10:35----------
why the hell are they using an enable

---------10:40----------
signal for the memory for USB what what

---------10:46----------
DDR reg enables so DDR like double data

---------10:50----------
rate as in memory so this signal is used

---------10:53----------
for the creation of the

---------10:56----------
Ram power oh let's just reuse that same

---------11:00----------
signal for powering on of USB what doe

---------11:07----------
Jesus Christ they did they did more

---------11:11----------
proofreading of the freakin tax plan

---------11:14----------
than they did at this schematic this is

---------11:17----------
what the really DDR egg really like you

---------11:22----------
couldn't have like USB reg enable or

---------11:24----------
something you just have to like

---------11:26----------
piggyback on the lot in the enable

---------11:27----------
signal that's used to turn on the RAM

---------11:31----------
why why by the way you just got C keyed

---------11:36----------
so first thing I'm kind of interested in

---------11:39----------
is to see if we do have five volts there

---------11:41----------
so we're gonna hunt under my microscope

---------11:47----------
camera which is which just died this

---------12:03----------
oh all right

---------12:19----------
let's edit this video later from the 12

---------12:21----------
minute and 50 second mark you know an

---------12:25----------
allen key for every now and then this

---------12:32----------
microscope camera dies aha nevermind I

---------12:35----------
just hit it and it started working again

---------12:40----------
yeah I just say I punched it and now it

---------12:43----------
works Oh

---------12:47----------
mods are doing good work tonight alright

---------12:49----------
so we're gonna go back to our board view

---------12:51----------
in schematic mm-hm

---------13:01----------
so on our board view software the USB

---------13:10----------
power should be showing up over here and

---------13:14----------
over here see that five volts for USB

---------13:25----------
I feel like I owe Paul Daniels a proper

---------13:28----------
apology I can't believe I called lend

---------13:35----------
his software hi Rex it appears the scene

---------13:39----------
is called land Rex and OBS that's really

---------13:42----------
not deserved okay

---------13:52----------
so let's find that little

---------14:02----------
mm-hmm and what do we get

---------14:15----------
you get 0.04 volts all right let's check

---------14:19----------
the other port and on the other port

---------14:35----------
wait am i measuring the right place

---------14:36----------
there that doesn't sound right

---------14:38----------
I know it's supposed to be a

---------14:44----------
side-to-side one

---------14:45----------
I measured the wrong place okay yeah

---------14:51----------
this is it

---------14:53----------
0.05 yeah we got 0.05 on one port and

---------14:59----------
0.04 on the other port so at this point

---------15:02----------
it's clear that the reason that this is

---------15:03----------
not working is because we're not getting

---------15:05----------
5 volts to the USB port we're getting

---------15:06----------
0.04 0.04 tells me that most likely it

---------15:12----------
is being told to turn on but it's

---------15:13----------
failing it doesn't tell me that the

---------15:14----------
enable is missing because it's trying to

---------15:16----------
do something you have 0.04 volts so

---------15:18----------
let's go back to the schematic in the

---------15:20----------
board view and go over what we should do

---------15:22----------
first so output is missing right so now

---------15:25----------
what I want to do is I want to figure

---------15:26----------
out why output is missing is output

---------15:28----------
missing because the chip is bad is

---------15:30----------
output missing because there's a short

---------15:32----------
to ground on output meaning that let's

---------15:34----------
say this capacitor is dead or this

---------15:36----------
capacitor is dead has turned into a wire

---------15:38----------
and now my output is getting

---------15:40----------
short-circuited to ground by the way

---------15:41----------
when we say short-circuit the way we

---------15:43----------
still reason that we say short-circuit

---------15:46----------
and just to be clear because a lot of

---------15:47----------
people will say short-circuit to mean

---------15:49----------
any type of defect is this 5 volts is

---------15:52----------
supposed to make its way from here all

---------15:54----------
the way to the usb port but if this

---------15:57----------
capacitor is broken then it will send

---------16:00----------
all that 5 volts to ground which is here

---------16:02----------
which means the circuit will stop short

---------16:04----------
so rather than taking the long route

---------16:05----------
over to the USB port it'll take the

---------16:07----------
short route and go to ground so if the

---------16:11----------
the issues that we could have are

---------16:12----------
something could be short-circuiting on

---------16:14----------
output

---------16:15----------
problem 1 the chip could be bad problem

---------16:18----------
2 the enable signal could not be present

---------16:21----------
so the chip is not being told to turn on

---------16:23----------
problem 3 the input could not be present

---------16:25----------
problem 4 so it's one of these above and

---------16:28----------
now we just got to be a detective so a

---------16:30----------
lot of the questions that I get when

---------16:31----------
people come for a tutoring or asset in

---------16:34----------
the in the comments is you know like 5

---------16:36----------
volts missing what replace well you got

---------16:39----------
to do a little bit of work it's not just

---------16:41----------
gonna be something that is immediately

---------16:43----------
apparent the moments that you you look

---------16:46----------
at it so let's

---------16:48----------
check and see if we have input on pins

---------16:50----------
two and three of this chip so here on

---------16:52----------
Paul Daniels is lovely open board view

---------16:54----------
you'll find that we can see that pins

---------16:58----------
two and three here our input Peppe

---------17:02----------
5-volt s3 so we're gonna check out Peppa

---------17:06----------
dogecoin s3 and see what we get there so

---------17:12----------
let's find that so pin two and three are

---------17:23----------
right here okay so it looks like we're

---------17:31----------
getting five volts on input so the input

---------17:35----------
is there so we can't blame that alright

---------17:37----------
now we're gonna check the Enable on pins

---------17:39----------
four and five four and five up here are

---------17:41----------
the enable and when you have the enable

---------17:48----------
there it's 3.3 volts so we can't blame

---------17:50----------
the enable obviously another way to tell

---------17:52----------
that you have the enable is that the

---------17:54----------
computer turns on if we did not have DDR

---------17:57----------
reg enable if DDR reg and Abel were

---------17:59----------
missing then we would not have the

---------18:01----------
voltage where this chip would not turn

---------18:03----------
on the voltage required for the RAM and

---------18:07----------
if we didn't have the RAM turning on

---------18:08----------
then you wouldn't get the chime and you

---------18:10----------
wouldn't get to be able to see the

---------18:11----------
screen and be able to see that part

---------18:12----------
where I can choose the try so that was

---------18:15----------
kind of a loaded thing to measure

---------18:16----------
because we knew that to be there so now

---------18:19----------
we're stuck with two possibilities the

---------18:21----------
chip is bad or there's a short circuit

---------18:23----------
to ground so at this point we're going

---------18:25----------
to cut the power you can unplug the

---------18:27----------
battery turn off the power supply and

---------18:29----------
put the multimeter in resistance mode

---------18:32----------
and we're going to check to see if

---------18:33----------
there's a short to ground on output

---------18:35----------
which is on pin 8 and on pin 9 so I'm

---------18:40----------
gonna check on pin 8 9 and to look wait

---------18:45----------
look over here this is 8 this is 9 so if

---------18:49----------
we look in the microscope

---------19:02----------
we have 8.4 ohms and on the other pin we

---------19:07----------
have 88.9 ohms so there is definitely a

---------19:11----------
short circuit to ground but now our

---------19:13----------
issue is where is the short circuit to

---------19:15----------
ground because the short circuit to

---------19:16----------
ground could be located in several areas

---------19:17----------
the short circuit to ground could be

---------19:19----------
located on the capacitors could be

---------19:22----------
located on any on these capacitors that

---------19:24----------
are on each one of the lines it could be

---------19:27----------
located in either one of the USB ports

---------19:29----------
or it could be located in the chip now

---------19:32----------
the reason that I would stand to believe

---------19:34----------
that the short is located in the chip is

---------19:36----------
again if we go back to the original

---------19:38----------
troubleshooting methodology look for

---------19:40----------
what is in the look for the commonality

---------19:43----------
so what's more likely that two

---------19:45----------
capacitors have gone bad that two ports

---------19:48----------
have gone bad or that one chip has gone

---------19:51----------
bad it's more likely that the damage

---------19:53----------
would have been constrained to a one

---------19:55----------
chip rather than two capacitors it's

---------19:57----------
more likely that one person is gonna

---------19:59----------
make a mistake then two people are gonna

---------20:01----------
make that same mistake so just

---------20:03----------
simplifying things the likelihood is not

---------20:05----------
that both ports just so happened to

---------20:07----------
become a short circuited at the same

---------20:09----------
time it's not that both capacitors that

---------20:11----------
are far away from each other just not

---------20:13----------
far be you get my D that are separate

---------20:15----------
from each other have decided to die at

---------20:18----------
the same time the likelihood is that the

---------20:20----------
chip exploded or died and that's what's

---------20:22----------
causing it short so I'm going to remove

---------20:24----------
this chip from the board using this

---------20:26----------
beautiful quick 861 DW hot-air station I

---------20:29----------
got a schilit since Dave Jones just

---------20:31----------
reviewed it looking for a quick buy a

---------20:34----------
quick on store de rossmann group comm

---------20:37----------
free same-day shipping within the

---------20:39----------
continental United States low price

---------20:41----------

---------20:52----------
get yours today

---------21:19----------
okay we're gonna

---------21:26----------
I saw Dave having fun with that old VGA

---------21:29----------
card that was so much that was funny to

---------21:34----------
watch I enjoyed that

---------21:42----------
he did enjoy brutalizing it I enjoyed

---------21:45----------
watching that old Nvidia get brutalized

---------21:53----------
where do you flick excess solder excess

---------21:55----------
solder gets flicked onto the iron

---------22:03----------
thank you Mike Miguel on how far the

---------22:06----------
beer I appreciate it I can't get my

---------22:12----------
nozzle on I'm a dumb

---------22:20----------
yeah

---------22:27----------
at least one of us is a smart all right

---------22:30----------
so

---------22:39----------
the airflow from the hot air station

---------22:41----------
high and fast if you want it to be

---------22:51----------
I got this nice bent nozzle so that I

---------22:54----------
can use it under the microscope so even

---------22:59----------
though I'm at an angle I can still get

---------23:01----------
my work done it's beautiful look at how

---------23:05----------
fast that came off in this multi-layer

---------23:06----------
PCB beautiful mm ah all right so now

---------23:12----------
we're gonna see if our short-circuit is

---------23:13----------
gone before moving forward and now we're

---------23:19----------
up to 28 30 kilo ohms 32 kilo ohms 35

---------23:25----------
kilo ohms and this meter software is

---------23:28----------
being dumb it's not showing you it on

---------23:31----------
the screen let's see will it show you

---------23:33----------
now really oh that's so lame hmm let's

---------23:43----------
try this again

---------23:50----------
yeah the meter software is being dumb so

---------23:53----------
you can ID is the cable for the meter

---------23:55----------
long enough to come over okay

---------23:56----------
your gillip to just look at it this way

---------23:59----------
so see that third 1.3 million ohms 1.4

---------24:04----------
million ohms so as you can see the issue

---------24:07----------
was our chip all along it was that damn

---------24:09----------
chip that was calling all the laws of

---------24:11----------
our problems and it was causing the

---------24:14----------
short circuit to ground so it's time for

---------24:25----------
a new one

---------25:01----------
all righty too much solder on the center

---------25:04----------
pad is kind of my trademark oh well

---------25:08----------
we're gonna grab a another chip from a

---------25:11----------
donor board and hopefully we'll have

---------25:17----------
made our USB circuit great again

---------25:39----------
[Music]

---------26:07----------
someone said just jump or input to

---------26:08----------
output well no

---------26:20----------
you know would be really cool is if

---------26:22----------
somebody engineered one of these ICS to

---------26:25----------
be able to handle a USB killer I wonder

---------26:29----------
what would take for that that's

---------26:31----------
something that would be really cool to

---------26:32----------
see from Dave Jones I would love to see

---------26:37----------
somebody engineer this to be able to

---------26:39----------
survive a USB kill

---------26:50----------
and it's crooked yeah it's crooked

---------27:02----------
so it's crooked crooked crooked but I'm

---------27:06----------
sure it'll work we'll see in a moment

---------27:30----------
and give fingerprints okay then I have

---------27:35----------
to find that little USB Drive that I

---------27:36----------
just had in front of me oh yeah

---------27:40----------
you took it so I wouldn't lose it okay

---------27:43----------
I'm gonna plug it in I'm gonna turn my

---------27:46----------
power supply on so the machine turns on

---------27:49----------
see if it blows up it doesn't look like

---------27:51----------
it's blowing up hold down the option key

---------27:58----------
and when I hold down the option key do

---------28:01----------
you see my other drop all right so now

---------28:04----------
it can see other drives that are

---------28:06----------
attached or it doesn't just see the

---------28:07----------
original one it sees one two and three

---------28:09----------
and I'm also going to take this little

---------28:11----------
drive here plug it into the other port

---------28:14----------
just to make sure it works on every port

---------28:21----------
come on you can do it

---------28:38----------
em

---------28:53----------
really let's go back to the first port

---------29:02----------
okay so the first port works and the

---------29:11----------
second port

---------29:12----------
[Music]

---------29:16----------
have you tried turning it on and off

---------29:19----------
again off and on again

---------29:26----------
hey where's Davis meter

---------29:30----------
Dave's meter is in the other room Jason

---------29:32----------
uses it oh man

---------29:40----------
a Swiper no swiping

---------29:44----------
all right now we got to figure out why

---------29:46----------
we only get USB on one port so back hey

---------29:51----------
we got one more USB port than we did

---------29:53----------
before right that's good stuff that's

---------29:56----------
victory by my standards so back to the

---------29:59----------
drawing board so if we go back here and

---------30:05----------
we look let's see

---------30:12----------
we only get one us people you're not

---------30:16----------
gonna make me take apart the whole thing

---------30:17----------
are you aren't you

---------30:19----------
oh yeah no way that would be mean

---------30:27----------
rip TCH this TC RS

---------30:41----------
Hey

---------30:59----------
sukkah okay so the port that's not

---------31:03----------
working is the one that's up here come

---------31:08----------
on

---------31:09----------
dogecoin help me out dogecoin okay so

---------31:17----------
let's measure and see what voltage we're

---------31:18----------
getting there this is where the five

---------31:24----------
volts is going to come out of the chip

---------31:25----------
from my chip go to my inductor before

---------31:28----------
going to my port now it's possible that

---------31:30----------
the port is fine and that the chip is

---------31:33----------
fine but that inductor blue because of

---------31:34----------
something that was plugged into it that

---------31:36----------
was improper you never know alright so

---------31:41----------
voltage mode gamma comma and alright Oh

---------31:50----------
meter stop complaining meter says five

---------31:55----------
volts on and on the other side we get it

---------32:02----------
on the other side we get five volts so

---------32:05----------
the port is getting power but it doesn't

---------32:08----------
see anything alright so he solved our

---------32:10----------
problem

---------32:11----------
the fault killed the cap on the second

---------32:14----------
port did the USB drive spin up at least

---------32:17----------
you ask the same question I asked Paul

---------32:19----------
just reasonable my ass SD is not

---------32:21----------
spinning up now alright so we are

---------32:25----------
getting power to that port but it

---------32:27----------
doesn't work so well what are the things

---------32:32----------
that could cause that USB port not to

---------32:34----------
work now this is us this is J 4600 right

---------32:37----------
so J 4600 is the one that's not working

---------32:43----------
so let's look that up

---------32:49----------
let's figure that out now that is tied

---------32:53----------
to trackpad and keyboard and bluetooth

---------32:56----------
so if I wanted to rule out the hub or

---------32:59----------
the PCH being the issue what I would do

---------33:01----------
is I would test the trackpad and the

---------33:03----------
keyboard if the trackpad and the

---------33:05----------
keyboard work then that means that I

---------33:06----------
cannot blame the USB hub Timmy says

---------33:09----------
wanted to say your videos are amazing

---------33:10----------
thank you discovered your channel we

---------33:12----------
could go on off learn heaps the super

---------33:13----------
Pony probes are king love those thank

---------33:15----------
you very much to Tim I really appreciate

---------33:17----------
that well if we look here again this is

---------33:21----------
the USB port that's not working right

---------33:23----------
now this USB port goes to a USB hub that

---------33:27----------
deals with Bluetooth and trackpad and

---------33:28----------
keyboards so if my Bluetooth works and

---------33:30----------
my trackpad and keyboard works then I

---------33:32----------
can't blame the hub logically speaking

---------33:34----------
so we're gonna boot into this operating

---------33:36----------
system at the beautiful speed of USB to

---------33:39----------
the lovely speed of USB 2 and we're

---------33:43----------
gonna see if the trackpad and the

---------33:45----------
keyboard are working within that

---------33:46----------
operating system but I'm gonna boot

---------33:48----------
using my working USB port and yes this

---------33:51----------
is old enough that it has USB 2 and

---------33:59----------
let's boot

---------34:07----------
[Music]

---------34:25----------
why do I have jeopardy stuck in my head

---------34:31----------
USB - USB - all right bluetooth is good

---------34:42----------
see bluetooth is here

---------34:46----------
so the only thing that I can imagine is

---------34:50----------
the physical port or a filter in between

---------34:56----------
so let's let's take a look at that

---------35:12----------
okay where was I back to the USB port

---------35:37----------
so on the USB data line there is a set

---------35:41----------
of filters so we have typically on USB

---------35:43----------
you have positive and negative for data

---------35:45----------
and then you have a filter that's what L

---------35:47----------
4600 is for l 4600 sits between the USB

---------35:51----------
line and this little SMC debug MUX this

---------35:58----------
little SMC debug MUX thingy you 4650 I

---------36:03----------
believe let's see it allows you to talk

---------36:06----------
to the SMC through the USB port or

---------36:08----------
something funny like that so there are

---------36:12----------
these two resistors that take that

---------36:14----------
signal and immediately just send it to

---------36:16----------
USB output over here so you 4650 tell is

---------36:21----------
what's going to Mo's latest if you s be

---------36:25----------
debugged port enable low over here is

---------36:28----------
low then it would meaning it's zero

---------36:32----------
volts then the USB port is going to talk

---------36:34----------
to the SMC if you s be debugged port

---------36:37----------
enable is high then it's going to allow

---------36:40----------
the USB port to talk to the USB MUX so

---------36:42----------
this thing is kind of like and it's kind

---------36:44----------
of like directing traffic so this USB

---------36:46----------
port can be used to talk to or program

---------36:47----------
or mess with the SMC or it can be used

---------36:50----------
as a regular USB port so let's find you

---------36:52----------
4650 we're gonna find you 46 50 and see

---------36:55----------
if you 46 50 is set to allow this port

---------36:59----------
to talk to the SMC or to talk to the USB

---------37:02----------
MUX because if the if the USB data over

---------37:05----------
here if this USB data is going to this

---------37:07----------
chip but then this chip is screwing up

---------37:08----------
and sending it to the usb to the SMC

---------37:11----------
instead of to the USB MUX then nothing's

---------37:13----------
gonna work so let's find out where you

---------37:15----------
46 50 is and you 46 50 thank God is on

---------37:21----------
this side of the board because I don't

---------37:23----------
feel like taking the board out today I'd

---------37:24----------
like to leave and get myself a burrito

---------37:26----------
so we're gonna find you 46 50 46 50

---------37:32----------
where where is you 46 50 yeah right down

---------37:36----------
here this is where I was so on pin 10

---------37:38----------
it's gonna tell us if this thing's in

---------37:39----------
the proper mode now pin 10 is something

---------37:42----------
that's going to be virtually impossible

---------37:43----------
to actually see or measure I'm also

---------37:47----------
going to want to turn this thing back on

---------37:52----------
get that to work now we're gonna turn

---------37:56----------
this thing back on have it boot do its

---------38:00----------
thing

---------38:02----------
so you 4650 pin ten is gonna be hello

---------38:12----------
hello right here

---------38:15----------
and since pin ten is gonna be difficult

---------38:18----------
to measure I can actually just measure

---------38:19----------
on this resistor up here so I'm looking

---------38:21----------
for that to be high because if it's high

---------38:23----------
3.3 volts then we're gonna be getting

---------38:26----------
the chip to send the USB port data to

---------38:30----------
the USB MUX and it is it's three point

---------38:34----------
five volts it is three point five volts

---------38:39----------
so here I can blame one of two things

---------38:41----------
behind door number one I can blame that

---------38:44----------
inductor that inductor that's sending

---------38:46----------
the USB data from the USB port to that

---------38:49----------
little SMC USB traffic directing chip

---------38:51----------
that could be better behind door number

---------38:53----------
two that little chip itself could be bad

---------38:55----------
and it could be not be passing the USB

---------38:57----------
data that it's receiving from the USB

---------38:58----------
port to the USB MUX I don't really have

---------39:01----------
a way to figure that out and honestly

---------39:02----------
the amount of time it would take to load

---------39:04----------
an oscilloscope or some type of logic or

---------39:06----------
data analyze or to figure out if it's

---------39:08----------
doing that is where is now that's a lot

---------39:11----------
more expensive time wise then it is to

---------39:14----------
replace those chips cost wise so I'm

---------39:17----------
going to replace the things that are

---------39:18----------
screwed up here see if I got my hotkeys

---------39:21----------
turned on properly so I'm what I'm going

---------39:23----------
to do is I'm going to replace huh

---------39:28----------
thank you to Rufus Francis I appreciate

---------39:31----------
the $2 I should mail your my dead boards

---------39:34----------
the Tim Cook if I knew where to mail

---------39:36----------
them to I would I would mail them with

---------39:37----------
questions I'm always interested in

---------39:40----------
getting answers from people who know

---------39:41----------
more than I do so this this little

---------39:44----------
filter over here that is taking the data

---------39:47----------
from my USB port and allowing it to pass

---------39:51----------
through to my ESM see us be debugged MUX

---------39:54----------
could be bad or this chip could be bad

---------39:56----------
it could be receiving the data but not

---------39:58----------
shooting it out I really don't have a

---------40:00----------
way to know and I don't really care to

---------40:03----------
figure

---------40:03----------
it out because I can replace you 4650

---------40:06----------
and I can replace el 4600 way faster

---------40:10----------
than I can actually figure that out so

---------40:12----------
since the time investment required to

---------40:15----------
properly diagnose that is less than the

---------40:17----------
amount of time would take for me to just

---------40:19----------
replace all that stuff especially

---------40:20----------
considering the fact that those

---------40:21----------
components cost you know probably sense

---------40:23----------
that it it doesn't make sense for me to

---------40:25----------
have to go through that so I'm gonna

---------40:27----------
find a board and grab that stuff off of

---------40:29----------
it and we're gonna repeal and replace it

---------40:32----------
with better stuff Kyle says I still

---------40:38----------
don't see how you 4650 Maps well alright

---------40:41----------
so well let's go over that one more time

---------40:42----------
just for cut so this is the USB port

---------40:45----------
over here now the USB port has five

---------40:48----------
volts for power and then it has pins two

---------40:51----------
and three which are data now pins two

---------40:54----------
and three which are data go through this

---------40:56----------
inductor and this is gonna unit

---------40:58----------
essentially get rid of the radio

---------40:59----------
frequency and crap in the signal and

---------41:01----------
though that's gonna go to this chip this

---------41:04----------
chip decides whether or not the USB data

---------41:06----------
is going to go to the SMC or to the USB

---------41:10----------
port so the end that this will output

---------41:13----------
the data to this chip which is the USB

---------41:18----------
MUX but it won't do that if it's

---------41:21----------
malfunctioning so I know that the USB

---------41:23----------
MUX is not malfunctioning because this

---------41:25----------
USB MUX is allowing my trackpad and

---------41:27----------
keyboard to work as I Prior demonstrated

---------41:29----------
and it's also allowing Bluetooth to work

---------41:31----------
as I previously demonstrated our 4651

---------41:37----------
and our 46:52 should bypass it though

---------41:39----------
someone says yeah let's see if they're

---------41:42----------
even on the board good question our

---------41:44----------
46:52

---------41:45----------
are these things even they're maybe

---------41:47----------
they're not even there and that would be

---------41:48----------
kind of silly to our 46:52 okay

---------42:14----------
that's on the other side of the board so

---------42:16----------
yeah I don't want to take out any screws

---------42:18----------
tonight thank you to Hoyt with a kind

---------42:22----------
comment and for the $2 so lets you 4650

---------42:28----------
and l 4600 or right up there alright so

---------42:32----------
we're gonna take those off so I'm going

---------42:34----------
to get make sure all the power is

---------42:35----------
unplugged while I'm doing this turn on

---------42:38----------
my hot air station

---------42:58----------
I think this person got us be killed

---------43:01----------
yeah please stop spamming me up and

---------43:14----------
it's gone into the depths of the air

---------43:16----------
filter

---------43:41----------
let's get rid of that old lead free

---------43:43----------
stuff put on the new leaded

---------44:03----------
so what you're saying is

---------44:09----------
I meta so what you're saying is last

---------44:11----------
night I really thought that was just a

---------44:17----------
meme but I met one that was interesting

---------44:22----------
I didn't know people in the real world

---------44:27----------
acted like that it was interesting and

---------44:32----------
fun we discussed these things in the

---------44:35----------
discord server if you're interested in

---------44:37----------
joining we got a link in the URL I mean

---------44:41----------
we have a link in the video description

---------44:44----------
good luck exporting that board to the EU

---------44:47----------
now I do not care about the EU one bit

---------45:03----------
and apparently neither do a lot of

---------45:05----------
people in here looking at the news for

---------45:09----------
the past two years you're adding

---------45:14----------
unnecessary heats of the board and Jessa

---------45:15----------
is about to flip her table

---------45:17----------
jess has been table flipping at a lot of

---------45:19----------
videos recently why you mad bro why you

---------45:26----------
mad bro it's not unnecessary heat lovely

---------45:36----------
Heat

---------45:40----------
beautiful heat

---------45:55----------
I don't know someone in Brussels will be

---------45:58----------
mad the way I fixed the board and they

---------46:00----------
won't let me import it and we get rid of

---------46:11----------
that little bump on top of that

---------46:13----------
capacitor there

---------46:14----------
I don't think Jessa's mad at me for the

---------46:20----------
way I'm soldering this I think that

---------46:21----------
you're reporting that she's mad at me

---------46:22----------
for the way I'm soldering this that's

---------46:25----------
what I think

---------46:36----------
all right so I would hope that this

---------46:39----------
fixes it if this does not fix it it's

---------46:41----------
either blown broken vias in the board or

---------46:48----------
bad port or something that's not gonna

---------46:51----------
be worth the time on a machine from 2011

---------46:54----------
you got one USB port you can buy

---------46:56----------
yourself a hub if you want some more

---------46:58----------
what speed is your air on my speed my

---------47:00----------
air speed was 95 in that case air speed

---------47:06----------
was 95 all right here comes the moment

---------47:09----------
of truth baby it comes the moment of

---------47:10----------
truth what do you thinks gonna happen

---------47:14----------
let's pray to our great doge let's see

---------47:20----------
what we get here so we're gonna plug all

---------47:24----------
right so we're plugged into the port

---------47:26----------
that worked

---------47:27----------
let's give it a minute or so to cool off

---------47:30----------
these boards cool off very very quickly

---------47:32----------
Apple boards Apple machines are almost

---------47:34----------
kind of designed to boil themselves out

---------47:36----------
from the inside rather than have real

---------47:38----------
ventilation so I can do things like turn

---------47:41----------
it on right after doing that I would not

---------47:43----------
do that to a lot of components but you'd

---------47:45----------
be surprised how very quickly these cool

---------47:47----------
off hello tuti why use discord instead

---------47:51----------
of teamspeak because I do it has the

---------47:55----------
chit's kind of like 21st century IRC so

---------47:57----------
I like it for that right so this is the

---------47:59----------
port that was already working I want to

---------48:01----------
check out the port that wasn't working

---------48:03----------
which is this one yes beautiful

---------48:10----------
we now have working USB 2.0 oh what a

---------48:17----------
great what a would it would an

---------48:19----------
accomplishment so just to go over what

---------48:22----------
it is that we did let's just go back to

---------48:23----------
the schematic I'm gonna explain exactly

---------48:25----------
how it failed and exactly how we

---------48:27----------
troubleshot this failure here so that

---------48:31----------
you kind of have an idea for next time

---------48:33----------
so if we go up to the beginning of the

---------48:37----------
board you'll see that we have two USB

---------48:39----------
ports we have J 4600 and J 46:10 this

---------48:44----------
USB port goes to a USB hub before it

---------48:47----------
goes to the PCH and the

---------48:49----------
CH is kind of like a north bridge south

---------48:50----------
bridge all-in-one this USB hub deals

---------48:54----------
with trackpad keyboard Bluetooth and

---------48:56----------
this USB port this USB hub over here

---------49:00----------
deals with the second USB port the

---------49:02----------
webcam and the infrared this USB port

---------49:05----------
was not working J 4600 so what I did is

---------49:08----------
I wanted to rule out if it was the port

---------49:10----------
of the PCH anything else so I tried the

---------49:12----------
trackpad and keyboard and the Bluetooth

---------49:13----------
in the operating system and it saw

---------49:15----------
Bluetooth devices and the trackpad and

---------49:16----------
keyboard worked within the operating

---------49:18----------
system which meant that this USB hub was

---------49:22----------
fine as was the PCH it had to have been

---------49:24----------
an issue with this something now the

---------49:27----------
issue is that it was and that what we

---------49:30----------
found out is that the issue was sitting

---------49:32----------
between j 4600 and this little MUX e

---------49:38----------
thingy over here so what's cool about

---------49:40----------
this machine one of the very few things

---------49:42----------
that's cool about an Apple product is

---------49:44----------
that if you are the Apple Store you can

---------49:46----------
talk to the SMC on the USB Lion so you

---------49:51----------
can plug something into the USB port and

---------49:53----------
have that thing that you plug into the

---------49:54----------
USB port go to the SMC pretty cool but

---------49:58----------
this this chip has to be functioning

---------50:00----------
because if it's not functioning then

---------50:02----------
it's going to send your USB data over to

---------50:05----------
the SMC for no reason and there's also

---------50:07----------
this inductor that sits between that's

---------50:09----------
designed to keep out noise now you can't

---------50:12----------
really measure this with a multimeter

---------50:13----------
because here's the thing this could die

---------50:15----------
and it could totally be fine it'll

---------50:17----------
measure 90 ohms it'll measure the amount

---------50:20----------
of it'll pass you the the voltage your

---------50:23----------
multimeter puts through but it won't

---------50:25----------
pass a complicated signal like you know

---------50:28----------
three you know one gigabit or whatever

---------50:31----------
400 megabits data per second it won't

---------50:34----------
pass that complex signal but it'll pass

---------50:36----------
the junk in your multimeter so you can't

---------50:38----------
really tell if it's working enough from

---------50:39----------
a multimeter which is why I just replace

---------50:41----------
it that fixed our problem where this

---------50:43----------
port was not working and this one did in

---------50:45----------
the beginning our issue is that neither

---------50:47----------
port was working and these ports as you

---------50:50----------
can see from here when neither ports are

---------50:52----------
working the only thing that these two

---------50:54----------
ports have in common

---------50:56----------
thank you very much the chicken bone I'm

---------51:00----------
not gonna answer that question but i

---------51:02----------
apprec--

---------51:03----------
you ate the $2 now in the beginning our

---------51:06----------
issue was both USB ports don't work and

---------51:08----------
the only thing that they have in common

---------51:09----------
the only thing those two ports have in

---------51:11----------
common is the PCH itself which we would

---------51:13----------
pray is not the issue because again 900

---------51:15----------
little solder balls under it screw

---------51:17----------
replacing that or this power IC this is

---------51:20----------
the chip that sends 5 volts out to both

---------51:23----------
ports this chip has two outputs it sends

---------51:26----------
power to both ports and output 1 goes to

---------51:30----------
port 2 and output 2 goes to port 1

---------51:34----------
because Apple so this this was the

---------51:38----------
second thing the only second thing that

---------51:40----------
these two ports had in common and in

---------51:43----------
this case you 4,600 was dead it was

---------51:46----------
shorting the outputs to ground it was

---------51:48----------
destroyed so we replaced it we got this

---------51:50----------
port back when we're done we got this

---------51:52----------
port but not this one and it's because

---------51:54----------
this stuff that's sitting in between the

---------51:56----------
USB port and the USB MUX was dead that's

---------51:59----------
it it works and as always I hope you

---------52:02----------
learned something you can check out the

---------52:04----------
links below for all the tools and all

---------52:06----------
the stuff that we use we have a forum

---------52:08----------
it's 29 bucks a month so if you're a

---------52:10----------
store you're a recycling company some

---------52:12----------
sort of business that has hundreds upon

---------52:13----------
hundreds of these devices and you want

---------52:16----------
shortcuts on how to fix them and you

---------52:18----------
want somebody to just kind of walk you

---------52:20----------
through the process you know what

---------52:21----------
voltages to measure and what stuff to

---------52:22----------
look forward to get boards fixed check

---------52:24----------
that out Duke is a professional engineer

---------52:26----------
and he's answering questions in the

---------52:27----------
forum every single day you can check out

---------52:29----------
all the equipment that we use and you

---------52:31----------
can check out playlists that I

---------52:32----------
categorized for all the different videos

---------52:35----------
for backlight issues charging issues

---------52:37----------
p.m. sleeve s4l missing machine turns on

---------52:40----------
but has no brain it turns on but has no

---------52:42----------
light in the screen it has a light in

---------52:44----------
the screen but no image it has an image

---------52:45----------
on the screen and no backlight this has

---------52:46----------
all been categorized by playlists to try

---------52:48----------
and make it nice and easy so thanks for

---------52:51----------
watching and I'll see you next time
