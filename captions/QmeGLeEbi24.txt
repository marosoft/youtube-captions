---------00:00----------
hello so in today's video we're gonna be

---------00:01----------
going over an a 1297 machine that has no

---------00:04----------
backlight a few differences I just like

---------00:05----------
to talk about today this is gonna be one

---------00:07----------
of the first videos I'm doing with the

---------00:08----------
new capture setup I used to have these

---------00:10----------
little mage well capture dongles because

---------00:11----------
I was doing the videos using a laptop

---------00:13----------
and I couldn't get a PCI Express card

---------00:14----------
for the laptop but what I've been doing

---------00:17----------
recently is I got a black magic card for

---------00:19----------
this and then I got a black magic card

---------00:20----------
for this long story short even when I

---------00:22----------
recorded with raw video settings what I

---------00:24----------
was I noticed that when I plug the HDMI

---------00:26----------
directly into the monitor the camera

---------00:28----------
looks better than it does to the

---------00:29----------
computer even when I'm recording raw

---------00:31----------
video no compression and that was kind

---------00:33----------
of weird long story short if you're if

---------00:35----------
you have like a 4 to 2 output source and

---------00:38----------
sometimes the color space winds up

---------00:40----------
getting compressed or looking funny if

---------00:42----------
it can't render the full color space I

---------00:43----------
am so under-qualified to say what any of

---------00:46----------
this means that I'm not even gonna

---------00:47----------
bother trying long story short what

---------00:50----------
comes out of the camera is now actually

---------00:51----------
getting recorded instead of getting

---------00:53----------
sodomized inside a little mage well

---------00:55----------
dongle now the own so now the other

---------00:57----------
change I made is I'm actually instead of

---------00:58----------
recording in x264 4 to 0 I actually

---------01:01----------
figured out how to record RGB or

---------01:03----------
something with so that means that

---------01:04----------
because this thing puts out 4 to 2

---------01:06----------
uncompressed video and that puts out 4

---------01:08----------
to 2 uncompressed video so by recording

---------01:10----------
to 4 to 0 I'm already kind of it

---------01:12----------
up so now the video in addition to

---------01:14----------
having the better capture hardware with

---------01:15----------
what I get an open broadcaster is

---------01:17----------
identical to what I would get HDMI out

---------01:20----------
directly into the monitor I also have 4

---------01:22----------
to 2 recording which sadly you don't get

---------01:25----------
to see that that's what makes me sad is

---------01:26----------
then you get to see what YouTube does to

---------01:28----------
it YouTube it just mashes it there is no

---------01:31----------
4 to 2 video on YouTube but looks cool

---------01:34----------
for me so hopefully it looks a little

---------01:35----------
better for you and we moving on to this

---------01:37----------
this is one of those those lovely

---------01:39----------
individuals that's like I don't want you

---------01:41----------
to touch anything but my back light fuse

---------01:43----------
that's all I want you to fix like not

---------01:45----------
thinking at all that maybe the reason

---------01:46----------
that the backlight fuse blew was because

---------01:49----------
something was up on the computer

---------01:52----------
so they were there really arguing hard

---------01:54----------
for me to plug this back in and you

---------01:57----------
tell me if you would plug this back in

---------01:59----------
this is why we don't take board only

---------02:00----------
repairs anymore by the way if you

---------02:01----------
anybody asking this is why we don't take

---------02:03----------
word only repairs because if I would

---------02:05----------
have fixed this board only this person

---------02:06----------
would plug that back in and you know

---------02:08----------
what they're gonna say

---------02:13----------
no anything that was corroded

---------02:15----------
there's no corrosion yeah of course

---------02:18----------
there's no pin 38 39 and 40 either of

---------02:20----------
course the pins are not corroded they're

---------02:21----------
not there and yes um again this

---------02:25----------
is the world that we live in somebody

---------02:26----------
actually believes that's good to plug in

---------02:28----------
so let's get on with it the other thing

---------02:30----------
you may have noticed is I'm back to this

---------02:31----------
silly microphone since the DPA 4065

---------02:34----------
broke

---------02:34----------
I am hoping hoping that I can get that

---------02:37----------
thing back I kind of oh this is the

---------02:41----------
other thing funny things so I'm using a

---------02:43----------
black magic capture card in a star tech

---------02:44----------
capture card

---------02:45----------
you may wonder why don't I just use -

---------02:47----------
black magic capture cards this is this

---------02:49----------
this is the funniest line of horseshit

---------02:50----------
so the black magic people said oh yeah

---------02:53----------
your microscope camera doesn't work with

---------02:55----------
this yeah we only support broadcast

---------02:57----------
devices not medical devices and it's

---------02:59----------
like what do you mean like this is HDMI

---------03:02----------
output there you know for two -

---------03:05----------
uncompressed there's there's HDMI out

---------03:07----------
and there's HDMI out like what do you

---------03:10----------
mean medical vs. broadcast like it does

---------03:13----------
it shouldn't matter if it's a medical

---------03:14----------
device of broadcast device pornographic

---------03:18----------
device it's a HDMI capture car

---------03:20----------
that cost several hundred dollars it

---------03:21----------
should be able to capture everything

---------03:22----------
anyone I would much recommend that

---------03:24----------
somebody get a star tech capture card

---------03:26----------
instead of a black magic after that

---------03:28----------
experience because the black magic thing

---------03:29----------
was just a complete waste of my

---------03:31----------
time

---------03:31----------
it also doesn't auto detect anything so

---------03:34----------
if you plug in a 1080p 60 frames per

---------03:37----------
second source and you set the black

---------03:39----------
magic to 1080p 59.94 it ain't gonna work

---------03:43----------
it's not even gonna say error it just

---------03:45----------
doesn't work which is portion the star

---------03:48----------
tech works right out of the box and the

---------03:50----------
star tech all has all the added benefits

---------03:52----------
that the black magic card did over the

---------03:54----------
major well capturing hardware which is

---------03:56----------
that it didn't it didn't have any of the

---------03:58----------
color space issues so everything

---------03:59----------
actually looks the same the last cool

---------04:01----------
upgrade after the getting my DP a

---------04:03----------
microphone back which I'm excited about

---------04:05----------
so this this thing is a piece of

---------04:06----------
I'm getting I'm hoping to get my DP a

---------04:08----------
4065 fixed that's not fixed I'm hoping

---------04:11----------
to just outright buy a DP a 40 88 I hate

---------04:14----------
the way this you have to do a lot of

---------04:15----------
work to actually make this sound decent

---------04:17----------
it sounds like a complete pile of crap

---------04:19----------
I'm actually getting rid of all these

---------04:21----------
lights in my office they're these really

---------04:22----------
cheap blue purplish tinted LEDs not cool

---------04:26----------
white I mean there

---------04:27----------
purple like I have this yellow covering

---------04:28----------
over them just to try to counteract it

---------04:30----------
but it really it with your eyes

---------04:31----------
after a while so I'm replacing all the

---------04:33----------
lights in the store because it's driving

---------04:35----------
me nuts and I'm kind of curious how it's

---------04:36----------
going to affect what the videos look

---------04:37----------
like but enough yammering on and let's

---------04:41----------
get to the board so I'm not really a fan

---------04:44----------
of this LCD connectors so this may be

---------04:47----------
usable and I don't really care I'm not

---------04:49----------
keeping it there I keep that there this

---------04:52----------
is gonna come back in a month with the

---------04:54----------
whole you never fix the thing so it's

---------05:00----------
better to be safe than sorry with the

---------05:02----------
type of person that's gonna ask me to

---------05:03----------
reuse that LCD connector an LCD cable

---------05:31----------
brave through it JB see you can do it

---------05:36----------
good JB see

---------06:02----------
okay turning the hot air off this is

---------06:07----------
definitely not the right proper tip for

---------06:09----------
a wicking but it'll actually work for it

---------06:12----------
you'll see

---------06:27----------
so I added some flux and after adding

---------06:31----------
the flux I'm gonna add some standard soy

---------06:35----------
de si UD aah

---------06:51----------
then we do some wicking so let's see

---------06:58----------
what we can get away with with this bent

---------07:01----------
tip that I use see the thing with a bend

---------07:05----------
the curvy tip that's beautiful is that

---------07:07----------
it really is multi-purpose because when

---------07:09----------
you use that elbow it works like a

---------07:10----------
larger tip but you can also use a little

---------07:12----------
fine point if you want a fine point tip

---------07:48----------
so I'm using the exact opposite of the

---------07:49----------
type of tip you should use for wicking

---------07:51----------
and is actually doing a pretty damn good

---------07:52----------
job you may ask why it's because it's

---------07:55----------
the end of the day and I don't feel like

---------07:56----------
changing my tip so see the elbow see how

---------07:59----------
I'm using the elbow when I use the elbow

---------08:02----------
I get the same effect that I would get

---------08:03----------
if I was using a larger tip and it did

---------08:06----------
my job for me pretty well I'm happy with

---------08:09----------
that not exactly at that happy with the

---------08:13----------
color balance of this but yeah there we

---------08:15----------
go beautiful color balance so then we

---------08:20----------
clean it off a little bit before finding

---------08:21----------
a new connector to put over there oh

---------08:24----------
another fun thing to keep in mind this

---------08:26----------
is the 17-inch 2011 model so guess

---------08:28----------
what's just about to die on it and I

---------08:31----------
opened it up and this thing was filled

---------08:33----------
with dust so yeah sometimes I wonder if

---------08:42----------
you know just by mistake one day if

---------08:44----------
Apple will make a computer with the

---------08:46----------
graphics trip that doesn't die just by

---------08:48----------
accident you know like not intending to

---------08:52----------
make something last but I have a feeling

---------08:58----------
if they really try

---------09:18----------
okay I got myself a new LCD connector

---------09:38----------
so now I just got to get some flux on

---------09:41----------
the board and take out my new LCD

---------09:44----------
connector come on come here

---------09:48----------
good LCD connector all right

---------10:02----------
that's my Amtech 559 I actually sell

---------10:05----------
that now so if you go to the website

---------10:06----------
mail-in dot repair that's ma ili n dot

---------10:10----------
repair you'll see if you search for AM

---------10:12----------
tech you'll see that we are selling this

---------10:14----------
stuff now a lot of people have asked

---------10:17----------
about it it's very hard to get flux

---------10:18----------
directly from AM tech because they ask

---------10:21----------
for there's no Add to Cart button

---------10:22----------
there's just you know POS and faxing and

---------10:27----------
all that stuff that's typically reserved

---------10:30----------
for lack of a better way to say it kind

---------10:32----------
of old people you know the modern world

---------10:36----------
I just want to be able to use PayPal or

---------10:38----------
a credit card hit a button and buy stuff

---------10:40----------
and you can do that on my side

---------10:42----------
unfortunately you can't on AM text which

---------10:44----------
is sucks because they're they make

---------10:45----------
wonderful wonderful products I love

---------10:47----------
antique flux

---------10:57----------
so I want to get this as aligned as I

---------10:59----------
can

---------11:09----------
and then press down as under with the

---------11:12----------
tweezers as I'm soldering because I

---------11:13----------
wanted to also be close to the board

---------11:15----------
it's not close to the board this work is

---------11:17----------
worthless so see how I'm always

---------11:26----------
constantly rearranging the board so it's

---------11:28----------
comfortable for me what's most important

---------11:30----------
is that while I'm working I am

---------11:32----------
comfortable the board's comfort I

---------11:34----------
don't care about the board's comfort the

---------11:36----------
board's comfort is completely

---------11:38----------
meaningless to me I should be using the

---------11:40----------
micro pencil at this point soil because

---------11:42----------
I have really a little room between the

---------11:43----------
Ethernet transformer and the LCD

---------11:45----------
connector as you can see as crappy as

---------11:55----------
this mic is it actually has some pretty

---------11:56----------
damn good isolation because again the

---------11:58----------
air filter is loud the hot air is loud

---------12:01----------
this air purifier is really loud so I

---------12:04----------
mean it's kind of nice to have have

---------12:07----------
something that sits in between it's it's

---------12:10----------
nice to be able to get rid of some of

---------12:12----------
that noise the BPA 4065 is a great

---------12:16----------
microphone it just doesn't isolate as

---------12:17----------
well because it's a nominee and this is

---------12:18----------
a cardioid but this is a cheap cardioid

---------12:21----------
it sounds like

---------13:05----------
notice the three on the end or harder

---------13:07----------
2/10 to solder because it's a higher

---------13:09----------
thermal mass be careful of this not

---------13:24----------
scratch it

---------13:27----------
nightmare

---------13:28----------
there's no schematic for that board and

---------13:29----------
that's the one where they put everything

---------13:31----------
backwards

---------13:31----------
I fixed it it's just that there's no

---------13:33----------
backlight tell them to fix the backlight

---------13:35----------
you know and it's good

---------13:52----------
you can also go pin by pin like this

---------13:56----------
thing I like about this tip is that you

---------13:59----------
can use it as a fine point iron or you

---------14:01----------
can use it as a stronger iron if you use

---------14:04----------
it as it with the blade use the blade

---------14:07----------
edge see if I want to use the blade I

---------14:11----------
can do that too like this so it's adept

---------14:17----------
at both clearing bridges and it's also

---------14:19----------
adept at just going one pin at a time

---------14:21----------
which is very nice admittedly the curvy

---------14:26----------
tip on the 20:27 is actually better for

---------14:28----------
any of the dragging stuff that I'd like

---------14:30----------
to do this doesn't not drag as well

---------14:32----------
because the lower thermal mass and it's

---------14:34----------
the way it's curved but I'm using this

---------14:36----------
one here just because that damn Ethernet

---------14:39----------
transformer it's a pain in the ass so

---------14:47----------
I'm just going up and down each pin now

---------14:49----------
show you have a nice melted in joint

---------14:53----------
nice fluid joint

---------15:00----------
I'm feeling the sharp tip of it all the

---------15:03----------
way up and then all the way down the pin

---------15:24----------
remember the last three pins are

---------15:26----------
supposed to be connected together those

---------15:27----------
are four back lights so I don't give a

---------15:29----------
 if there's a blob a little bit of a

---------15:31----------
blob there you don't want anything huge

---------15:35----------
it's just that they're shorted together

---------15:36----------
it's nothing to cry about this is a

---------15:39----------
motherboard repair nothing is anything

---------15:40----------
to ever cry about but if I were to cry

---------15:44----------
it wouldn't be over that and we're

---------15:51----------
almost done and if you used that at-15 -

---------15:55----------
Jaso - you can literally go all the way

---------15:58----------
across and it's much faster than this

---------16:00----------
one

---------16:09----------
come on mofo how am i have to short it

---------16:14----------
together I just wanted to look nice and

---------16:16----------
clean oh well that's good so now we have

---------16:22----------
to do the sides sides are a pain in the

---------16:28----------
ass especially on this because it's

---------16:30----------
really easy to flow solder inside the

---------16:32----------
connector and if you flow solder inside

---------16:34----------
the connector that's no good no good so

---------16:46----------
now I already know that the anchor pins

---------16:47----------
were soldered to the points where it

---------16:48----------
sits flat on the board so now I'm just

---------16:50----------
using the side of my blade at tip

---------16:51----------
touching the pad of the board and I'm

---------16:54----------
touching the side of the connector

---------16:55----------
that's soldered now I'm gonna add flux

---------17:01----------
and I'm going to push down on this just

---------17:03----------
to make sure this can remove any excess

---------17:06----------
and beautiful absolutely beautiful now

---------17:10----------
we do the other side I'm gonna turn the

---------17:11----------
board around again keep in mind that

---------17:13----------
this is all about your comfort not to

---------17:15----------
comfort of the board the board's comfort

---------17:16----------
does not matter one bit okay we're gonna

---------17:23----------
go over here and

---------17:31----------
okay same idea whoa why the hell did you

---------17:34----------
come from get the off my board and

---------17:39----------
tiny bit of and then it's pushed

---------17:41----------
down make sure it's flat on the board

---------17:45----------
clean my iron make sure it's nice and

---------17:48----------
clean by the way for those who are

---------17:50----------
questioning what type of bladed tip this

---------17:51----------
is that I'm using this is from hack oh

---------17:55----------
the t30 - KN that's t30 - KN for the

---------18:01----------
hack OFM 2030 - iron which attaches to

---------18:04----------
the hakko FFX 951 station which I

---------18:08----------
reviewed previously okay now the second

---------18:12----------
issue here is we going to be since

---------18:13----------
that's short of the backline fuse will

---------18:15----------
be bad so let's just go ahead and get

---------18:16----------
rid of that it's gonna be this little

---------18:19----------
thing with the P on it

---------18:25----------
okay I'll remove it with hot air but

---------18:27----------
it's gonna be easier to take it off with

---------18:29----------
the hot air if the joint is freshly

---------18:32----------
flowed and had let it cider instead of

---------18:34----------
the lead-free that it comes with so what

---------18:36----------
I've done there is it just made it a

---------18:38----------
little bit easier for the hot air to

---------18:39----------
remove that now that this JBC station

---------18:41----------
needs anything to be easy this this

---------18:43----------
thing just rips through everything like

---------18:45----------
crazy

---------18:57----------
boom this ayah that thing was off and

---------19:01----------
sitting in a cold room and it just yeah

---------19:04----------
so now he just suck up all the old stuff

---------19:07----------
all the old lead-free solder is gonna be

---------19:11----------
gone in that little ball in my iron now

---------19:14----------
we're ready to put a fuse there that's

---------19:16----------
not blown and after I put a fuse if it's

---------19:18----------
not blown I'll plug a screen and you'll

---------19:20----------
get to see that we have a working image

---------19:22----------
working backlight working everything

---------19:23----------
there is absolutely no way in hell that

---------19:26----------
I'm gonna plug in this person's original

---------19:27----------
screen no I don't care what you asked me

---------19:31----------
to do I do not do what people ask me I

---------19:33----------
do what will work and I charge

---------19:35----------
accordingly the same should go for you

---------19:40----------
you are not gonna do what people ask you

---------19:42----------
to do that that is a rabbit hole to hell

---------19:47----------
when you do what people ask you to do

---------19:49----------
you yourself

---------19:58----------
I let my fuse fly it's actually sitting

---------20:02----------
on the tip of the the input to my air

---------20:05----------
filter and it didn't go in the air

---------20:06----------
filter that's amazing it doesn't want to

---------20:14----------
leave my tweezers that's fine I'll

---------20:16----------
partially solder it it's partially on

---------20:18----------
the board now that it's partially on the

---------20:21----------
board I'm going to flux it and then heat

---------20:22----------
it and push down and then it will

---------20:24----------
surface tension will bring it exactly

---------20:26----------
where it needs to be so watch see well I

---------20:29----------
don't you'll have trouble getting the

---------20:30----------
stuff off the tweezer you don't try to

---------20:32----------
solder it perfectly just get it the

---------20:33----------
on there and so you have once you have

---------20:35----------
it on there in some way then you can

---------20:38----------
push it into place BAM

---------20:46----------
then when you know it's perfectly in

---------20:48----------
place exactly where it's supposed to be

---------20:49----------
you can always do this a little bit of

---------20:55----------
flux BAM okay now what it's time to do

---------21:04----------
is grab a screen and see if this thing

---------21:07----------
actually you works I love how fast this

---------21:10----------
thing turns on but just also turns off

---------21:12----------
it cools down very very quickly

---------21:14----------
it's JBC station is lovely again is this

---------21:17----------
something I would ever buy myself if

---------21:19----------
somebody else didn't get it for me at

---------21:20----------
$1,800 no way I would pay for that if I

---------21:27----------
was fixing stuff that cost ten thousand

---------21:29----------
dollars and above at prices are that you

---------21:31----------
know I was priced accordingly I just

---------21:33----------
can't I can't pay that much for

---------21:36----------
something that I'm using a fixed

---------21:37----------
laptop motherboards you know it's just

---------21:38----------
it's not happening so now I'm gonna get

---------21:41----------
a screen and see how that works let's

---------21:44----------
put my fuses back yep yeah I can't greed

---------22:00----------
a 15 inch screen will work on a 17 inch

---------22:11----------
machine a 13 inch screen will work on a

---------22:13----------
15 or 17 and a 17 inch one and a 15 inch

---------22:16----------
won't work on the 13 at least when it

---------22:18----------
comes to the old ones that use LVDS when

---------22:20----------
it comes to DisplayPort you can use a 13

---------22:22----------
inch retina on a 15 inch retina and vice

---------22:24----------
versa you can use a 13 inch Aaron 11 and

---------22:26----------
share and vice versa but you cannot do

---------22:29----------
not for the love of God plug a retina

---------22:31----------
into an air and air into a retina an air

---------22:33----------
or retina into an older one that uses

---------22:36----------
LVDS just because the connector is the

---------22:37----------
same does not mean it will work

---------22:39----------
that will end in a nightmare for you

---------22:45----------
okay I should measure to see if the

---------22:50----------
short to ground is gone that'll be the

---------22:52----------
responsible thing to do before plugging

---------22:54----------
this in wouldn't it yeah I think I

---------22:56----------
should measure if the short to ground is

---------22:57----------
gone before I put power through it let's

---------23:00----------
see zoink what do I have

---------23:04----------
Oh point 6 9 4 I don't remember what

---------23:09----------
this LED drivers should be that sounds

---------23:11----------
good that doesn't sound like a short

---------23:18----------
it's turning on and it lit up the screen

---------23:26----------
okay now quickly turn it off before the

---------23:29----------
GPU dies because you know what this

---------23:31----------
what's gonna go on with this so that's

---------23:34----------
that now hopefully that worked and

---------23:36----------
hopefully it looked better than my

---------23:38----------
previous videos again I know that

---------23:39----------
YouTube is ruining it but and you do

---------23:42----------
what you can

---------23:42----------
I'm kind of excited to see what the new

---------23:44----------
lights are gonna be like in the office I

---------23:45----------
I'm not doing that for filming to be

---------23:47----------
honest and I would hope filming but I

---------23:49----------
think it'll affect my mood if I'm not in

---------23:51----------
a room with incredibly overbearing

---------23:53----------
bluish purplish blue first-generation

---------23:57----------
lighting I don't know what it is I just

---------23:58----------
feel like that just with your eyes

---------24:00----------
and I don't know why I ever bought these

---------24:02----------
cheap pieces of and I'm so excited

---------24:04----------
to be getting rid of them now as is

---------24:06----------
usual with my luck they were actually

---------24:09----------
lost right now they're actually lost

---------24:11----------
with FedEx and the reading so you know a

---------24:12----------
lot of people say oh can you ship via

---------24:14----------
FedEx why do you use the post office

---------24:16----------
post offices terrible blah blah blah

---------24:18----------
here's the thing that people don't get

---------24:19----------
about the post office Priority Mail is

---------24:22----------
two to three days from one side of the

---------24:23----------
country to another with one two three

---------24:25----------
pound packages that winds up costing the

---------24:27----------
same or like almost the same as UPS

---------24:30----------
Ground and FedEx Ground with FedEx

---------24:31----------
Ground or UPS ground from Vegas to here

---------24:34----------
it's like a week and a half or a week

---------24:36----------
whereas priority mail is two to three

---------24:37----------
days for almost the same price so that

---------24:39----------
allows you to get the benefits of second

---------24:40----------
day shipping or three day shipping

---------24:41----------
without paying the ridiculously inflated

---------24:43----------
rates of second day or next day shipping

---------24:46----------
it's cool and the thing is with with

---------24:49----------
package loss like people are gonna

---------24:51----------
really disagree with me on this but

---------24:52----------
everybody loses packages I mean you got

---------24:55----------
to realize like the guy who works at

---------24:57----------
FedEx delivering you know 100 or 200 or

---------24:59----------
5000 packages a day who gets paid as

---------25:02----------
crappy a salary he cares about you

---------25:04----------
just as little as the post office man

---------25:07----------
post office man cares just as little

---------25:09----------
about you as the UPS man it is just a

---------25:11----------
job to those people you know it's not

---------25:13----------
like they're getting bonuses and stock

---------25:15----------
options based on packages delivered it's

---------25:17----------
you know it's hourly they all of this a

---------25:20----------
very similar model none of them is

---------25:22----------
treating you any better than the other

---------25:23----------
anyway so this board is good now works

---------25:25----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------25:27----------
something
