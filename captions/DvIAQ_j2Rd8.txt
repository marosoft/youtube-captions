someone's purged in it

---------00:06----------
someone's purged in it

---------00:09----------
spooch

---------00:11----------
I'm gonna show you

---------00:14----------
that's what I thought hey everybody

---------00:18----------
how's it going so today it's time for

---------00:20----------
you to another episode of broken MacBook

---------00:23----------
bored repair let's take a look at this

---------00:25----------
MacBook which is an 8 1466 macbook air

---------00:27----------
see if we can figure out what's wrong

---------00:29----------
with it and make this board work again

---------00:31----------
first thing that we're gonna do is

---------00:32----------
unplug the battery we're gonna turn on

---------00:35----------
our power supply and see how many amps

---------00:38----------
this MacBook takes because that's gonna

---------00:42----------
tell us what's wrong with it all right

---------00:44----------
get the power supply software on the

---------00:47----------
screen get that beautiful Paul Daniels

---------00:49----------
multimeter software on the screen and

---------00:51----------
turn this thing on 12 to 24 million

---------00:55----------
which means this is probably missing

---------00:56----------
p.m. sleep s4l the most annoying water

---------00:59----------
pair there is EA is pp best present PP

---------01:05----------
bus is 4.2 volts on that side and 4.2

---------01:07----------
volts here so it looks like we're

---------01:09----------
actually missing our pp bus this is not

---------01:11----------
gonna be p.m. sleep s4l missing this is

---------01:13----------
gonna be PP bus missing I've never

---------01:15----------
experienced that on an air in 24 million

---------01:17----------
that's very strange so let's get the

---------01:19----------
board out of the case and see if we can

---------01:20----------
figure out what's going on I'm going to

---------01:22----------
guess that this machine has liquid

---------01:25----------
damage on the is L six two five nine

---------01:28----------
ship and as you can see we have

---------01:30----------
corrosion in just the area that I

---------01:32----------
anticipated the is L six two five nine

---------01:35----------
area so now what I'd like to do is see

---------01:38----------
if that polarizer filter that I got for

---------01:41----------
my microscope camera makes a difference

---------01:43----------
a lot of you've been suggesting that I

---------01:45----------
get a polarizer filter so that when I

---------01:48----------
saw her and there's flux the reflections

---------01:50----------
are a little less annoying and also when

---------01:52----------
I turn up the lights you can see the

---------01:54----------
detail you don't see all the annoying

---------01:55----------
reflections off the components this

---------01:57----------
thing was about 120 bucks after tax at

---------01:59----------
Adorama be honest I kind of just wanted

---------02:02----------
an excuse to go to Adorama so that I

---------02:03----------
could take a look at the sony FX 7 and

---------02:05----------
FX 9 which I did for about half an hour

---------02:08----------
I was able to leave Adorama without

---------02:11----------
purchasing a new camera that like is way

---------02:14----------
outside of my budget but I just wanted

---------02:19----------
an excuse to kind of go and play with my

---------02:20----------
look at my toy so let's see what this

---------02:23----------
looks like under the microscope

---------02:25----------
and let's see if we could get this thing

---------02:28----------
to work again I'm gonna turn on the

---------02:30----------
microscope light now the thing is in the

---------02:32----------
past I'm like polarizer filter wouldn't

---------02:35----------
have really worked because you need to

---------02:36----------
have a lot of light because it kind of

---------02:39----------
turns down your light however I have

---------02:42----------
since overclocked in my light I have

---------02:47----------
overclocked my light so that yeah look

---------02:53----------
at that there alright so hopefully the

---------03:03----------
detail will be better now let me just

---------03:06----------
lock the microscope in place so that it

---------03:08----------
doesn't shake as much there we go add a

---------03:11----------
nice quality image hopefully that looks

---------03:13----------
better than it did before

---------03:14----------
thank you everybody for your suggestions

---------03:17----------
here for the polarizer filter I really

---------03:19----------
appreciate it

---------03:20----------
if the video looks better now than it

---------03:22----------
used to

---------03:23----------
well every one of you who suggested that

---------03:25----------
I get this polarizer filter give

---------03:30----------
yourself a little pat in the back and

---------03:34----------
this superior video is because of you I

---------03:36----------
really do like excuse to spend money in

---------03:38----------
Adorama and B&H it's an addiction

---------03:46----------
and easily imagine of the current sense

---------03:48----------
resistors and they look toasted

---------04:23----------
this is the 48 millimeter one criminal

---------04:26----------
minded the whole concept is that when I

---------04:29----------
use flux and solder and all that there's

---------04:33----------
or alcohol or anything there's usually a

---------04:36----------
lot of reflections and it's also when I

---------04:37----------
turn the light up reflections off of the

---------04:39----------
metal from so you have from the solder

---------04:45----------
pads themselves in that with the

---------04:47----------
polarizing filter you should see less of

---------04:49----------
that that's the idea let's see if that's

---------04:53----------
how it works out in practice let's add

---------04:58----------
some flux here see if I can kind of

---------05:03----------
scrape away and get those points back to

---------05:04----------
their beautiful luster

---------05:20----------
now the pads for the resistor themselves

---------05:22----------
seem fine

---------05:23----------
it's the pathway between the resistor

---------05:26----------
and the chip that seems broken so you

---------05:31----------
see this you see how there's like a dis

---------05:36----------
over here yeah I'm gonna up all so I can

---------05:42----------
up the light right oh no no no light

---------05:45----------
doesn't like more than 14 volts all

---------05:47----------
right

---------05:58----------
there we go all right so you can still

---------06:00----------
have all the [ __ ] there but still get a

---------06:02----------
good picture when the light is high

---------06:03----------
awesome so here you can see that the

---------06:06----------
probe point is kind of broken now I'm

---------06:09----------
not trying to solder on top of it what

---------06:11----------
I'm trying to do is scrape away the

---------06:12----------
corrosion scrape away the corrosion and

---------06:17----------
then solder over same thing here just

---------06:22----------
mild scraping at first and there I can't

---------06:27----------
so here I may be able to get away

---------06:30----------
without a jumper and probably not here I

---------06:32----------
definitely need a jumper so we're going

---------06:33----------
to install a couple of jumpers over here

---------06:52----------
now our main issue appears to be that

---------06:56----------
one of the current sense resistors is

---------06:58----------
not connecting to the is all six to five

---------07:00----------
now so there is a current sense resistor

---------07:03----------
on the other side of the board and the

---------07:04----------
way this works is the current sense

---------07:06----------
resistor whose going ever really small

---------07:09----------
drop in voltage across it and that small

---------07:11----------
drop in voltage across the current sense

---------07:12----------
resistor is going to let our is all six

---------07:14----------
two five nine know how much current the

---------07:17----------
system is using the larger the voltage

---------07:19----------
drop across the resistor the more

---------07:21----------
currents the system is using the less

---------07:23----------
voltage drop across the resistor the

---------07:25----------
less current that the system is using

---------07:29----------
now on each end of the current sense

---------07:31----------
resistor on the beginning in the end of

---------07:32----------
it there is yet another resistor and its

---------07:36----------
purpose is to go to the is all six two

---------07:38----------
five nine from the current sense

---------07:39----------
resistor so that the is L six two five

---------07:42----------
nine can see what's happening on each

---------07:44----------
side of the current sense resistor and

---------07:45----------
what you see are the this is the path

---------07:48----------
that the is l six two five nine has to

---------07:50----------
that current sense resistor and it's

---------07:52----------
completely destroyed

---------07:53----------
so the is L six two five nine is going

---------07:56----------
to C twelve eight volts on one side and

---------07:59----------
zero on the other and it's going to

---------08:00----------
think whoa that's a really big

---------08:02----------
difference so that must mean the

---------08:04----------
system's taking a million bazillion amps

---------08:06----------
and it's going to turn off the power

---------08:08----------
route because it's trying to protect

---------08:09----------
itself

---------08:14----------
I could show you that in the schematic

---------08:15----------
later and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

---------08:19----------
run this little jumper wire over here

---------09:20----------
now anything you see there that doesn't

---------09:22----------
look like it's perfectly set in place

---------09:23----------
you'll see when I use the hot air that

---------09:25----------
it will be perfectly set in place I

---------09:27----------
don't really care if everything is in

---------09:29----------
perfectly set in place what I care about

---------09:31----------
is that the proper amount of flux is

---------09:32----------
there so that when I use the hot air

---------09:35----------
it'll kind of move itself into place and

---------09:38----------
also if you see any solder joints where

---------09:40----------
there's a little bit of for that

---------09:41----------
Hershey's kiss effect on it that's going

---------09:44----------
to be because there was not enough flux

---------09:46----------
used in the soldering process which is

---------09:47----------
also fixed by me putting flux there TLDR

---------09:50----------
you really can never use enough flux and

---------09:52----------
anybody who tells you otherwise is evil

---------10:04----------
never metal phones I don't feel like

---------10:07----------
turning the board around so but the hot

---------10:08----------
tweezers are gonna make all that [ __ ]

---------10:09----------
flow in a place you'll see it's gonna

---------10:11----------
look really nice

---------10:18----------
more flux because more better right

---------10:23----------
[Applause]

---------10:27----------
we got some more work to do here let's

---------10:31----------
just flow all this stuff in a place

---------10:39----------
yay see how they fall flows into place

---------10:41----------
so that's the secret because a lot of

---------10:43----------
people don't understand how with

---------10:44----------
unsteady hands I can do stuffs that it

---------10:47----------
looks like it's Factory and the way I

---------10:49----------
get work done even though I have very

---------10:50----------
unsteady hands is that little trick the

---------10:54----------
surface tension is gonna pull everything

---------10:55----------
into place to exactly where it supposed

---------10:57----------
to go so it's not like I'm sitting there

---------10:59----------
and perfectly aligning the qfn of the

---------11:01----------
BGA or the resistor I put the thing

---------11:03----------
there like a total idiot who has no

---------11:07----------
control over his hands and then I flux

---------11:11----------
and wait the flux really makes me look a

---------11:13----------
lot smarter than I am I'm telling much

---------11:15----------
more skillful you know I'm really

---------11:18----------
defrauding all these people into

---------11:19----------
thinking I have a clue what I'm doing

---------11:20----------
and I don't it's the flux this over here

---------11:26----------
also it looks really bad I got to see if

---------11:28----------
this Kuroko that carotid probe point

---------11:30----------
goes to anywhere on the other side of

---------11:32----------
the board or not

---------11:38----------
and this one as well I may wind up

---------11:43----------
running a wire just because I don't

---------11:44----------
really trust that long-term there we go

---------11:47----------
so I don't do is I want to scrape the

---------11:49----------
corrosion without scraping the copper

---------11:50----------
which is a hard thing to little scraping

---------11:52----------
you won't get the corrosion too much

---------11:53----------
scraping you'll scrape the copper and

---------11:55----------
then at once I get to the copper cover

---------11:56----------
it and solder so that it doesn't get go

---------11:58----------
bad over time

---------12:07----------
this is the point at which it would make

---------12:09----------
sense that has turned the board around

---------12:10----------
stop being so stubborn

---------12:27----------
this area doesn't look too terrible but

---------12:29----------
it does need touch-up see how that red

---------12:34----------
stuff that's the board bleeding

---------12:43----------
I don't want the boy to bleed hello we

---------12:47----------
do this

---------13:09----------
you could see this probe point is [ __ ] -

---------13:12----------
I can't trust it that's connected to

---------13:15----------
whatever it's supposed to be on the

---------13:16----------
other side of the board

---------13:23----------
the

---------13:25----------
oh well rawr it's knocked everything off

---------13:29----------
the boys haha

---------13:30----------
I knocked everything off the board and

---------13:32----------
the customers watching let's dream well

---------13:36----------
ah this is a good day

---------13:40----------
Erica the person who sent this in is

---------13:42----------
watching as I knock all this [ __ ] off of

---------13:43----------
their board yep I are garbage junk

---------13:50----------
cheezer's that are me she absolute [ __ ]

---------13:55----------
condition no need to get nervous when

---------13:57----------
you know you can what you're doing I can

---------14:00----------
fix that

---------14:01----------
easy breezy covergirl easy breezy

---------14:10----------
beautiful covergirl get off the tweezer

---------14:15----------
you [ __ ]

---------14:22----------
this [ __ ] is so small that's the thing

---------14:25----------
like if you you know I'll feel like I'm

---------14:28----------
getting it not 100% perfect and then I

---------14:30----------
just have this feeling like I have to

---------14:31----------
sneeze and without even sneezing just

---------14:34----------
feeling like I may have to sneeze and

---------14:35----------
everything just goes running off of the

---------14:37----------
board and I realize that I'm working

---------14:41----------
with microscopic crap it really puts

---------14:45----------
things in perspective with the tiniest

---------14:46----------
hand [ __ ] up hand movement just makes

---------14:49----------
everything on the board go poof and

---------14:50----------
disappear

---------15:35----------
that should be good to go not bad so

---------15:43----------
remember how I said that this probe

---------15:44----------
point over here I wasn't sure if this is

---------15:45----------
going to the other side of the board

---------15:46----------
properly if you look at it this kind of

---------15:49----------
see this it's like kind of half on there

---------15:52----------
that's part of the battery current

---------15:53----------
sensing circuit so to go over current

---------15:57----------
sensing here before I get finished if

---------15:59----------
you take a look you have two current

---------16:01----------
sense circuits one for the charger one

---------16:03----------
for the battery because the computer

---------16:04----------
wants to know how much current the

---------16:05----------
charger is using it also wants to know

---------16:06----------
how much current the battery is using so

---------16:08----------
here's where the power comes in from the

---------16:10----------
charger it goes to this transistor what

---------16:13----------
this transistor does is that essentially

---------16:14----------
make sure that if the charger is not

---------16:16----------
plugged into the wall the battery does

---------16:18----------
not go back through the system and try

---------16:19----------
to charge as a charger make sure that it

---------16:21----------
things only go one way it goes through

---------16:23----------
there and then it goes to this current

---------16:25----------
sense resistor this is a resistor that

---------16:27----------
is in the circuit path of the charger

---------16:30----------
going to the computer so it's it's it's

---------16:32----------
in the stream so imagine that you were

---------16:34----------
trying you wanted to know how fast the

---------16:38----------
stream was going in a river you can't

---------16:41----------
simply tell by looking at the water if

---------16:43----------
you're far away how fast it's going

---------16:45----------
you'd have to put your hands in the

---------16:46----------
stream and feel how much pressure it's

---------16:48----------
pushing with and then you'd have an idea

---------16:50----------
of how strong the current is and the

---------16:53----------
same is true here the ISL 6259 can't

---------16:56----------
tell how much current is going through

---------16:59----------
the charger just by being next to it so

---------17:02----------
what it does is it has if if I wanted to

---------17:06----------
know if I'm on top of a mountain and I

---------17:07----------
want to know how much water is going to

---------17:09----------
the stream I could ask my friend hey can

---------17:10----------
you put your hands in the water and let

---------17:11----------
me know and give me a phone call tell me

---------17:13----------
how how hard it is over here the ISL six

---------17:16----------
two five nine has his friend our 7120

---------17:19----------
put his hand in the water and then our

---------17:22----------
7120 calls Hugh 7100 on resistor our

---------17:26----------
7121 and our seventy-one 22 so over here

---------17:30----------
let's say you have a 18 volts 4 charger

---------17:32----------
right and then you have 17 over here I

---------17:34----------
don't think wow that's a huge difference

---------17:36----------
that must be using a lot of amperage let

---------17:37----------
me shut the system down here is if you

---------17:39----------
have 18 volts here in seventeen point

---------17:41----------
nine nine nine nine nine nine nine volts

---------17:43----------
here thanks all right cool it's just

---------17:44----------
being a normal MacBook not taking too

---------17:46----------
much and since it's gonna be a voltage

---------17:48----------
drop from this side to this

---------17:49----------
side you have a resistor going between

---------17:51----------
the il-62 5:9 at the beginning of the

---------17:53----------
resistor and the ISL six two five nine

---------17:55----------
in the ends of the resistor now if this

---------17:58----------
resistor is burned or this pathway is

---------18:01----------
blown then you're gonna have 18 volts

---------18:03----------
here the is all C 18 volts here but

---------18:07----------
it'll see zero volts there because this

---------18:09----------
path is blown and it'll think this is

---------18:11----------
set 18 volt difference between here and

---------18:13----------
here which means when it does its little

---------18:14----------
internal calculation it's gonna think

---------18:16----------
the system is using 1 bazillion

---------18:18----------
gazillion gazillion amps and that's no

---------18:20----------
good and it turns it off same is true

---------18:23----------
for the battery you have a current sense

---------18:24----------
resistor over here so here you have two

---------18:25----------
slash from battery and before it gets

---------18:30----------
the system the first thing it gets to

---------18:31----------
current sense resistor before the

---------18:33----------
resistor and after the resistor each one

---------18:36----------
we have a path go into the ISL six two

---------18:39----------
five nine the charging chip now one of

---------18:41----------
the things I do if I want to see if this

---------18:43----------
path is working I'm not gonna measure

---------18:44----------
from here to here and here to here and

---------18:46----------
here to here and here to here and here

---------18:48----------
to here and here to here and here to

---------18:49----------
here and here to here and here to here

---------18:51----------
cuz that's that's a big [ __ ] waste of

---------18:52----------
my time what I do is I add up the

---------18:54----------
resistances of everything in the circuit

---------18:56----------
and then I measure between here and here

---------19:00----------
if this is a loop between 27 and 28 I

---------19:03----------
should just get o 10 ohms plus 0.02 ohms

---------19:08----------
plus 10 ohms and back again let's see if

---------19:12----------
that's what I get I'm gonna turn on Paul

---------19:14----------
Daniels his amazing multimeter software

---------19:17----------
and see what I measure so for charge or

---------19:23----------
current sensing yeah if it turns out

---------19:25----------
omus mode for a charger current sensing

---------19:29----------
20 the path is not broken for battery

---------19:35----------
current sensing

---------19:42----------
31.5 million ohms the path is broken so

---------19:46----------
if even if this turns on via charger

---------19:48----------
it's not going to be able to charge the

---------19:49----------
battery because it's going to think it's

---------19:51----------
using too much current now I'm gonna

---------19:53----------
guess that the path is blown between

---------19:54----------
here and the other side of the board so

---------19:56----------
let's see where that connects let's go

---------19:58----------
to the schematic on the bore of you

---------19:59----------
where do you connect it well you go

---------20:07----------
through you fifty six hundred I wonder

---------20:11----------
if I can just kind of run a wire between

---------20:13----------
here and there and get away with it hmmm

---------20:18----------
that would actually be much easier let's

---------20:21----------
see turn on the fume extractor if not

---------20:24----------
then I have to run a wire to the other

---------20:25----------
side of the board which would suck

---------20:34----------
and the board looks like a freaking

---------20:35----------
banjo yeah the person who owns this is

---------20:45----------
never gonna see what a botched job this

---------20:46----------
is anyway so it doesn't really matter

---------20:48----------
it's not like he's like watching the

---------20:50----------
video and 1080p60 in the chat or

---------20:53----------
something like that probably went to the

---------20:56----------
bathroom or something he's never gonna

---------21:00----------
see this I'm probably giving the guy a

---------21:03----------
heart attack

---------21:12----------
crap I think I think you came back

---------21:25----------
I like to run the wire in the same

---------21:27----------
direction of the leg it's a little OCD

---------21:31----------
thing of mine it shouldn't matter buddy

---------21:40----------
I believe in Erica I believe in Erica

---------21:47----------
more than Erica believes in Erica like

---------21:55----------
I'd let you work on it if you said you

---------21:58----------
if you wanted to work on this right now

---------21:59----------
that the customer watching I would say

---------22:01----------
go for it mm-hmm

---------22:10----------
I'm sure he won't mind right guy let's

---------22:18----------
have a vote in the chat how many people

---------22:20----------
think that we should do I should have

---------22:21----------
Erika try to work on Linux guru gamers

---------22:23----------
board right here what do we say

---------22:35----------
[Laughter]

---------22:36----------
there's a few rational people over here

---------22:39----------
no no no

---------22:48----------
yeah the answers are out doing the nose

---------22:53----------
actually this wire I just been to [ __ ]

---------22:55----------
yeah

---------23:06----------
this wire is more bends this wire is

---------23:08----------
more crooked than Eric your strategy for

---------23:10----------
winning plush toys

---------23:28----------
that's unprofessional

---------23:39----------
they wouldn't say that if you fix the

---------23:43----------
board

---------23:48----------
Jim says we want Orioles work on it

---------23:53----------
Jim I'm still trying to get Oriole to

---------23:55----------
make it to the litter box

---------23:58----------
all right so you got a kind of half a

---------24:00----------
side of joint there

---------24:18----------
I can route that wire a little later

---------24:21----------
let's see if that changes the resistance

---------24:23----------
we're looking for that's it so the two

---------24:28----------
resistors that I believe is a zero ohm

---------24:29----------
and a 2.2 ohm resistor yeah zero ohm

---------24:34----------
plus 2.2 ohm plus 0.01 so we're looking

---------24:37----------
for two point two zero one ohms that's

---------24:41----------
what I should get here if this is going

---------24:43----------
the right way

---------24:49----------
[ __ ] you 11 million you piece of [ __ ]

---------24:53----------
let's see wait a second

---------25:01----------
did I just put a bad resistor on the

---------25:03----------
frickin board oh my god no I want a zero

---------25:09----------
oh man 2.2 m zero two zero one resistor

---------25:14----------
Wow

---------25:16----------
the resistor I took off my frickin donor

---------25:17----------
boy oh wow

---------25:19----------
I got trolled the resistor on the damn

---------25:21----------
donor board is no good piece of [ __ ]

---------25:24----------
that's the first time that's happened to

---------25:26----------
me current sense okay well the thing is

---------25:32----------
I saved time using donor boards instead

---------25:35----------
of the new resistors book but and people

---------25:37----------
have always asked well why do you do

---------25:38----------
that because it saves time it still I

---------25:41----------
mean the amount of time I've saved over

---------25:42----------
the past seven years is still beats

---------25:46----------
still makes up for this oh this was a

---------25:51----------
good troll

---------25:58----------
that resistor is going to be upside down

---------26:00----------
just because

---------26:07----------
he'll be fine he watches the channel he

---------26:13----------
knew what he was getting into

---------26:14----------
I also gotta rip his JTAG off that

---------26:21----------
resistor is upside down just like

---------26:23----------
Australia

---------26:33----------
okay we want to get you to the pro point

---------26:36----------
in the resistor at the same time is this

---------26:43----------
an Australian resistor this resistor is

---------26:48----------
from the land of Paul

---------27:01----------
we should

---------27:04----------
I don't know if they have that cookies

---------27:07----------
in Australia they have eucalyptus leaves

---------27:11----------
for the koala bears that gunk over there

---------27:18----------
is gonna get cleaned out by the

---------27:19----------
ultrasonic well so there was let's see

---------27:22----------
what do we have now piece of trolling

---------27:26----------
ship board so

---------27:32----------
BAM better be close enough now

---------27:36----------
next up this little piece of [ __ ] I

---------27:42----------
don't trust the way this looks

---------27:44----------
I saw a little bit of red under there

---------27:46----------
and I was right yeah it was a little bit

---------27:49----------
of red rusting

---------27:53----------
kinda yeah it'sit's not too terrible I

---------27:57----------
don't want to leave it there

---------28:07----------
we already made this an Australian board

---------28:16----------
proper amount of flux Eric okay

---------28:53----------
patience what is your definition of

---------29:09----------
this here is superficial superficial but

---------29:13----------
still triggering me superficial but

---------29:19----------
still triggering me and now we got to

---------29:23----------
make sure this I'm pretty sure this

---------29:25----------
doesn't go down this is just a

---------29:26----------
measurement point that doesn't actually

---------29:27----------
go anywhere else in the board that's oh

---------29:30----------
yeah it doesn't go anywhere else to the

---------29:32----------
board or does it yeah it does

---------29:35----------
Suns a [ __ ]

---------29:54----------
let's charge your face

---------30:55----------
someone's purged in it

---------30:58----------
someone's purged in it spooge

---------31:03----------
yeah I'm gonna show you

---------31:07----------
that's what I thought

---------31:28----------
I want to get to that nub under there

---------31:51----------
luis of mining for copper

---------32:32----------
let's make sure that's not ground in

---------32:33----------
there if I dug to ground this is useless

---------32:37----------
and I got to start over at the other

---------32:38----------
side of the board

---------32:45----------
in our grounds now are you grounds

---------32:51----------
no wait wait looks like a step

---------32:56----------
yeah that round okay keep digging

---------33:01----------
you're using a wire brush I'm using a

---------33:04----------
knife

---------33:11----------
using a knife and scraping the [ __ ] out

---------33:13----------
of it oh and I'm gonna take a solder

---------33:16----------
ball probably and toss it in there and

---------33:18----------
use the hot air to make myself a solder

---------33:21----------
pad to run my jumper wire too

---------33:28----------
oh yeah it has made a sadder pen here

---------33:30----------
that I made a friend

---------33:52----------
come on get in there

---------33:56----------
what what why teasing Apple doesn't

---------34:00----------
why would they do something that would

---------34:02----------
save their users money and why

---------34:11----------
all right that's good all I wanted was a

---------34:12----------
bump and I got a bump that's all I

---------34:15----------
needed

---------34:15----------
I'm not actually gonna solder to it I'm

---------34:18----------
gonna tin a wire

---------34:32----------
you know maybe I will try soldering

---------34:35----------
instead of hot airing it in Crest

---------34:41----------
ultrasonics is my customer for a year

---------34:42----------
about ten years ago how hard was it to

---------34:45----------
get them to call you back I'm curious

---------35:04----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] dick bigger yep I

---------35:11----------
can't hug on the wire because that pro

---------35:14----------
point is so weak I'll break it I'll rip

---------35:16----------
the pro point off the board it's not

---------35:17----------
like I can there's nothing to really

---------35:19----------
there's nothing structurally holding

---------35:22----------
that in so I have to have the wire

---------35:25----------
pushed into the board there we go so now

---------35:27----------
I can rip this off here now I could rip

---------35:31----------
it off the capacitor the capacitors be

---------35:33----------
is held on by a nice beefy pad

---------35:46----------
I'm hot area because they want the wire

---------35:48----------
to flow in a place is that that thing

---------35:51----------
that it's soldered it to that little

---------35:52----------
point that's barely a solder pen that's

---------35:54----------
barely exists so I needs to be in the

---------35:58----------
exact right spot

---------36:05----------
now this thing over here I don't care

---------36:07----------
that this looks [ __ ] up it doesn't

---------36:08----------
matter at all because this that's just

---------36:12----------
that's just for testing so see how the

---------36:14----------
chip there's a trace that comes out of

---------36:16----------
the chip and then it goes here and then

---------36:18----------
that's just a pro point for measuring

---------36:19----------
that can look [ __ ] up and who gives a

---------36:20----------
[ __ ]

---------36:21----------
this matter is because this is where

---------36:23----------
it's going to another part of the

---------36:24----------
machine they this is where charger phase

---------36:27----------
and another part of the board is coming

---------36:28----------
into the chip and that can't be messed

---------36:32----------
up or else there's nothing going to the

---------36:33----------
chip so that fixes that area now I'm

---------36:37----------
just gonna wrap it cool the board using

---------36:39----------
our patent-pending

---------36:40----------
a rapid cool technology let's do this

---------36:45----------
think about a boom board loves it the

---------36:49----------
board loves rapid cool technology what

---------36:52----------
do you guys think fan spin

---------36:53----------
after this I got to get a little bit of

---------36:55----------
business administration work done eat

---------36:57----------
some food alright

---------36:58----------
I think the board's gotten itself cooled

---------37:01----------
off enough MacBook doesn't deserve to be

---------37:04----------
any colder than that

---------37:07----------
come on little MacBook oh wow it's in

---------37:12----------
the fall strange okay see we get come on

---------37:16----------
500 milliamps and booting 500 milliamps

---------37:19----------
in booting yes fan spin this is a 34 37

---------37:24----------
so it's gonna turn on off on off on off

---------37:25----------
on don't ask me why they all do that so

---------37:29----------
you do an RTC reset not sure why that's

---------37:31----------
not a glitch that's just it being a

---------37:33----------
MacBook so I do this I do this well why

---------37:38----------
is Paul Daniels a software not showing

---------37:40----------
that I switched over to vaults there we

---------37:43----------
go alright so as you can see we get 8

---------37:45----------
point 5 volts and people-watch d3 hot

---------37:47----------
are the 4 volts we got before 500

---------37:49----------
milliamps which means the CPUs on take

---------37:50----------
brains work and the fan is spinning

---------37:52----------
which as you know this is that's pretty

---------37:54----------
much testing done here there's not much

---------37:56----------
more else to it when it comes to

---------37:57----------
rossmann repair quality control so what

---------37:59----------
was going on here is it the Kuro that

---------38:01----------
traces were corroded for several lines

---------38:03----------
the current sense traces that I

---------38:05----------
explained to you in addition to that we

---------38:07----------
also had another corroded Pro point

---------38:09----------
between or if you look on the board

---------38:13----------
right over here so charger phase

---------38:18----------
goes to this capacitor this capacitor

---------38:21----------
sits between charger phase and charger

---------38:23----------
boob but charger phase is going to be

---------38:25----------
this section right here charger phase is

---------38:30----------
coming around here right after the

---------38:34----------
transistor so this is the way PP but gee

---------38:36----------
three hots going to work you have the

---------38:39----------
charger which is 18 volts coming out up

---------38:41----------
here this allows it to come through then

---------38:44----------
this is going to switch on and off so

---------38:46----------
you're going to get 18 0 18 0 18 0 and

---------38:50----------
eventually it's going to average itself

---------38:51----------
out to 8.58 volts this chip is the chip

---------38:54----------
that decides when this transistor which

---------38:55----------
essentially a switch turns on and off so

---------38:57----------
think of it like a light switch that's

---------38:58----------
going really really fast

---------39:00----------
once it goes to the coil and as he's

---------39:02----------
smoothing capacitors to ground instead

---------39:04----------
of having 18 0 18 0 you get a nice

---------39:06----------
smooth 8.5 volts before the coil but

---------39:09----------
after the transistor there's this point

---------39:11----------
that goes to the is all six two five

---------39:13----------
nine just so we can get an idea needs

---------39:14----------
remember what I've said it need the chip

---------39:16----------
needs to see what it's doing if it's a

---------39:17----------
DC to DC boost circuit for a backlight

---------39:19----------
circuit you have the feedback trace and

---------39:20----------
over here you have charger phase the

---------39:22----------
chip needs to know what it is doing it

---------39:25----------
needs to know am i switching too fast or

---------39:27----------
switching too slow so that it can adjust

---------39:28----------
itself same thing as if you're driving

---------39:30----------
if you're driving and you're in a car

---------39:32----------
you you can tell because you can see the

---------39:34----------
speedometer how fast you're going if

---------39:36----------
somebody puts the it just covers your

---------39:37----------
eyes you can't see the road of the

---------39:38----------
speedometer what do you do you hit the

---------39:40----------
brakes you don't know how fast you're

---------39:41----------
going you don't know what's in front of

---------39:42----------
you so the same thing is gonna happen

---------39:44----------
here it needs to have this and this was

---------39:46----------
broken in addition to the current sense

---------39:48----------
traces they were broken before being

---------39:49----------
broken so we ran a bunch of wired

---------39:51----------
everything I think that's 44 or 46 gauge

---------39:53----------
Remington magnet wire you could find

---------39:55----------
links to it down below in the

---------39:56----------
description and that's about it this

---------39:58----------
board now works and as always I hope you

---------40:01----------
learned something I'll see you in the

---------40:03----------
next video thank you so much for

---------40:04----------
watching and for being a part of what we

---------40:05----------
do here bye
