---------00:00----------
hey everybody here I want to read an

---------00:01----------
email that I received from a customer

---------00:03----------
that sent in a repair it really makes me

---------00:05----------
sad I'm not an individual who's going to

---------00:07----------
support every single person just because

---------00:10----------
they are on my ideological side or

---------00:13----------
because we agree in terms of politics

---------00:15----------
policy philosophy or anything like that

---------00:17----------
and one of the things we're areas that

---------00:19----------
hurts is that I spend a lot of time

---------00:21----------
trying to fight and push back against

---------00:24----------
this narrative that third party repair

---------00:26----------
is universally bad that they're always

---------00:28----------
gonna be using garbage parts on purpose

---------00:30----------
not even because the good ones are not

---------00:32----------
available just because they want to save

---------00:33----------
a dollar or they don't have knowledge

---------00:35----------
and they're gonna be experimenting on

---------00:36----------
and destroying your device and if they

---------00:37----------
destroy your device they're not gonna

---------00:39----------
take accountability for it but the only

---------00:41----------
the manufacturer knows how this box

---------00:43----------
works so if you send it to anybody else

---------00:44----------
bad things will happen I put a lot of

---------00:46----------
time and a lot of effort and to pushing

---------00:48----------
back against this narrative and when you

---------00:50----------
have people like Tim Harmons or you know

---------00:52----------
the other people who just figure out how

---------00:53----------
to do this stuff on their own and start

---------00:55----------
very wildly successful businesses I

---------00:57----------
think there's enough proof out there

---------00:58----------
that this is possible however

---------01:00----------
unfortunately there are also the

---------01:02----------
scumbags in our industry that destroy

---------01:04----------
things that use bad parts that don't

---------01:07----------
take accountability or responsibility

---------01:08----------
when something goes really really wrong

---------01:10----------
with a customer my answer to this has

---------01:12----------
always been review sites I don't like a

---------01:15----------
lot of the review sites that currently

---------01:16----------
exist and there are a lot of people who

---------01:18----------
will just be douche bags and pedantic or

---------01:20----------
just leave fake reviews for the hell of

---------01:22----------
it but at the end of the day you can get

---------01:23----------
a general idea of whether or not a place

---------01:26----------
it's doing decent work or garbage work

---------01:29----------
and eventually it does come around to

---------01:31----------
them in that time frame that it takes

---------01:32----------
for it to come around to them who knows

---------01:34----------
how many things are destroying so I'm

---------01:35----------
gonna read you this email that just

---------01:36----------
really made me sad when I received it

---------01:38----------
also my apologies to the individual who

---------01:40----------
sent this email I was going to respond

---------01:42----------
several weeks ago but it's been very

---------01:44----------
very busy at work so I have not gotten

---------01:46----------
around to it hi Louis my name is

---------01:48----------
redacted

---------01:49----------
I got a MacBook Pro arrive to your shop

---------01:51----------
a week ago I'm living in Turkey at the

---------01:53----------
edge of the effing Middle East I'm an

---------01:55----------
agricultural research for an Istanbul

---------01:57----------
Technical University we are actually

---------01:59----------
doing pretty cool stuff for our future

---------02:00----------
five to six months ago my MacBook

---------02:03----------
started to have random kernel panics GPU

---------02:05----------
Arizona starts so I found you on YouTube

---------02:07----------
watched all your videos that might be

---------02:09----------
related to my problem and I read your

---------02:10----------
PDF also had conversations on discord

---------02:12----------
with other guys so

---------02:13----------
from my research I thought my problem is

---------02:15----------
you 8900 soldering was going to fix it

---------02:16----------
since I thought it isn't too complicated

---------02:18----------
process I took it to the local guy to

---------02:20----------
fix it I was working on a presentation

---------02:21----------
or something so I needed my computer

---------02:23----------
fast and I wanted to avoid 50 ish bucks

---------02:26----------
of shipment it was a mistake

---------02:28----------
the Turkish guy did something to it he

---------02:29----------
totally effed it up somehow my computer

---------02:31----------
was booting before at least 2 to 3

---------02:33----------
minutes probably a chip was getting hot

---------02:36----------
enough to expand then was contact and

---------02:37----------
then we're starting but now it's totally

---------02:38----------
black

---------02:39----------
so I shipped it to you now here's the

---------02:41----------
conversation with one of your colleagues

---------02:42----------
I haven't gotten any answers after that

---------02:43----------
I can't say that you have to fix it I

---------02:45----------
can't say that it's your problem that

---------02:46----------
you guys are not fixing it it's my

---------02:48----------
mistake

---------02:48----------
I should have shipped it to you in the

---------02:49----------
first place all I can do is ask that you

---------02:51----------
be a little flexible in this case and

---------02:52----------
take a look at it on live video so I can

---------02:54----------
show the idiot that it was supposed to

---------02:55----------
fix it I don't know why but I have a

---------02:57----------
huge trust in you please just take a

---------02:58----------
look at it yourself it said I know from

---------03:00----------
the live videos Luis had been working on

---------03:02----------
boards that someone else has worked on

---------03:03----------
so that shouldn't be the case when we

---------03:04----------
said that we were not able to work on it

---------03:06----------
because somebody else worked on it I saw

---------03:08----------
a live video just a week ago he was

---------03:09----------
inspecting and repaired a board that

---------03:11----------
someone else had messed up it's just

---------03:12----------
like my case I'm essentially talking

---------03:14----------
about the money and the politics and

---------03:16----------
very much so pleading that I take a

---------03:19----------
second look at it now to be clear once

---------03:21----------
we start seeing serious type of PCB

---------03:23----------
damage where you see the PCB is actually

---------03:25----------
flexing as a result of what somebody

---------03:27----------
else has done at that point we do have

---------03:30----------
to call it quits

---------03:30----------
my first hope at this video is that this

---------03:32----------
customer can go to any one of I don't

---------03:34----------
know what they have in Turkey with the

---------03:35----------
Department of Consumer Affairs a

---------03:37----------
Ministry of business or whatever and

---------03:38----------
file some sort of complaint that

---------03:40----------
requires this technician to eventually

---------03:43----------
pay him for the MacBook that he broke or

---------03:45----------
restore it to the condition that it was

---------03:47----------
before or at the very least show him

---------03:50----------
that it's not that I see oh look there's

---------03:52----------
two screws taken out of this machine I'm

---------03:53----------
not going to work on it because I'm so

---------03:55----------
prissy but rather that a lot of these

---------03:57----------
devices that we get are in genuinely

---------03:59----------
destroyed condition I'd like to show you

---------04:01----------
what that genuinely destroyed condition

---------04:03----------
is and try to give you a better idea of

---------04:04----------
why it is unfortunately in this case I

---------04:07----------
was not able to help you and I'm also

---------04:08----------
hoping with this that less people do

---------04:11----------
with this jackass did because there are

---------04:13----------
times where I've made mistakes I'm not

---------04:15----------
perfect I've made mistakes but when I

---------04:17----------
make that mistake I take out my credit

---------04:19----------
card okay here's a board if I open a

---------04:22----------
machine that's covered in dog piss and

---------04:23----------
they said it I just had no backlight and

---------04:25----------
now it's dead

---------04:26----------
know that I'm not talking about that I'm

---------04:28----------
talking about when if I have done

---------04:29----------
something that is similar to what this

---------04:31----------
individual did and I can see the

---------04:33----------
destruction in front of me what I do is

---------04:36----------
I take out my credit card and I replaced

---------04:38----------
that part before the customer picks it

---------04:40----------
up that's that's just what you do and if

---------04:42----------
people want our industry to be taken

---------04:44----------
seriously if they want it to have a real

---------04:46----------
reputation for being a proper option

---------04:48----------
then people like this need to take

---------04:50----------
accountability and responsibility for

---------04:52----------
when they do something wrong the same

---------04:53----------
way that I asked Apple to take

---------04:55----------
accountability and responsibility for

---------04:56----------
their design flaws for the flex cable

---------04:58----------
issues in the touch bar MacBooks for

---------05:00----------
butterfly keyboards for everything else

---------05:02----------
I can't ask Apple to take accountability

---------05:04----------
and responsibility for what they do

---------05:05----------
wrong if people within my own industry

---------05:08----------
won't take accountability and

---------05:09----------
responsibility for what they do wrong

---------05:11----------
that being said let's get to the repair

---------05:13----------
all right here we're gonna take a look

---------05:14----------
at an a 1398 that's having display

---------05:16----------
issues where it's not showing stuff in

---------05:17----------
the screen let's see if we can figure

---------05:19----------
out what's wrong with this MacBook in if

---------05:20----------
it's the year that has a very standard

---------05:22----------
and common problem that many of them

---------05:24----------
have but now the evil iPad rehab will

---------05:26----------
know how to fix because there's a watch

---------05:31----------
and everything you do I am disgusted at

---------05:33----------
the idea that I'm showing somebody for

---------05:35----------
iPad rehab how to fix something oh no

---------05:38----------
you know what this is actually typically

---------05:41----------
an easy fix but instead we're gonna be

---------05:43----------
leaving this one for mark no okay let's

---------05:47----------
go over this and explain what's wrong

---------05:48----------
with this machine typically the only

---------05:50----------
problem with this machine is that the

---------05:52----------
buck converter for the GPU comes

---------05:54----------
desolder from the board there's a fault

---------05:55----------
line in this machine where they didn't

---------05:57----------
there's no support for the board and it

---------05:59----------
flexes and in the 2013 an up model they

---------06:02----------
put these little foam pads in it so that

---------06:03----------
it doesn't flex but in the 2012 model

---------06:06----------
they didn't so the buck converter for

---------06:08----------
the GPU will turn will go away and there

---------06:11----------
will be no video and one of the ways

---------06:12----------
that you can easily diagnose this is by

---------06:14----------
measuring GPU v core you'll get 0 volts

---------06:17----------
or 0.2 volts or 0.4 volts rather than

---------06:19----------
the standard point 9 volts and because

---------06:21----------
this machine was touched by a [ __ ]

---------06:23----------
as you can see the GPU has been reflow

---------06:25----------
and the cpu heatsink screws have been

---------06:28----------
over tightened because you can see the

---------06:29----------
enamel coming off of the heatsink before

---------06:32----------
they even managed to check to see

---------06:33----------
whether or not the GPU is getting repeat

---------06:37----------
core so I'm gonna see if we can still

---------06:38----------
salvage of this and if we can

---------06:40----------
we have mark Schafer from my pad rehab

---------06:42----------
for all of our Zell Melling needs he's

---------06:44----------
gonna carry the same ozium our 6,200 see

---------06:46----------
up from the basement on his shoulder set

---------06:49----------
it up right on Paul's desk and replace

---------06:51----------
this GPU with a new one I'll do it okay

---------06:53----------
so the first thing we're gonna do is see

---------06:55----------
how [ __ ] is it that we are how [ __ ]

---------06:57----------
are we so I'm gonna plug this in it's

---------07:01----------
drawing one amp and it goes dong okay

---------07:07----------
now I want to see if I have GPU V core

---------07:09----------
so GPU V core is like CPU V core if any

---------07:13----------
of you overclock desktop PCs you've

---------07:14----------
probably seen CPU v coin your BIOS it's

---------07:16----------
the voltage that goes to your CPU and

---------07:18----------
GPU v core is obviously gonna be the

---------07:20----------
voltage that goes to your GPU and you

---------07:22----------
need that there for your GP or your CPU

---------07:25----------
to have a brain and if you don't have

---------07:26----------
GPU V core then at one of the brain and

---------07:29----------
as you can see here we are getting zero

---------07:32----------
volts on GPU v core so if we have zero

---------07:35----------
volts on GPU V coil you don't reheat the

---------07:37----------
[ __ ] GPU you stupid stupid noob great

---------07:42----------
job destroying somebody else's property

---------07:44----------
when I see that kind of stuff in phones

---------07:46----------
I will hunt down whatever shop worked on

---------07:49----------
it and call them and try to get the tech

---------07:52----------
that worked on it on the phone and give

---------07:55----------
him a lecture yeah like I screwed

---------07:57----------
something up but I have mark here to

---------07:59----------
help me fix it then Paul's gonna help me

---------08:01----------
fix it and then if Paul and Mark can't

---------08:02----------
help me fix it then Louis is taking out

---------08:04----------
his credit card and buying that guy a

---------08:05----------
new board because mistakes happen but

---------08:08----------
you don't put the mistake back in the

---------08:09----------
laptop and for [ __ ] sake okay you make

---------08:12----------
a mistake soldering how do you make a

---------08:13----------
mistake with this how do you strip oh

---------08:15----------
look there's a screw it look there's a

---------08:17----------
screw stuck in the screw hole but

---------08:19----------
there's no head Oh

---------08:20----------
oh my god you rapist you've absolutely

---------08:23----------
rapist what the ohm Jesus Christ what is

---------08:27----------
this what did you do what did you do

---------08:31----------
dum-dum it again like I've done I've

---------08:35----------
done stuff that was not this bad but

---------08:37----------
I've screwed stuff up oh you can watch

---------08:39----------
my last live stream I have somebody

---------08:41----------
who's gonna help me fix it he he fixed

---------08:44----------
the things that I screwed up and if I

---------08:45----------
can't fix everything I screwed up I'm

---------08:47----------
taking out my credit card and I'm

---------08:49----------
getting them a new one that's just

---------08:52----------
part of how it works so is it possible

---------08:54----------
to cause long screw damage in these

---------08:56----------
laptops yes you can if only yeah because

---------08:59----------
the see that most of the screw holes are

---------09:01----------
not but the screw holes by the CPU

---------09:03----------
though yeah and there's a and I don't

---------09:04----------
know if you're really even fixing that

---------09:06----------
because of the sheer amount of traces

---------09:08----------
that are right next to the CPU also the

---------09:10----------
differences in an iPhone you don't need

---------09:12----------
to actually put the screw grommet there

---------09:13----------
again whereas on this machine you need

---------09:15----------
the screw grommets to be there because

---------09:16----------
you have to mount the heatsink or else

---------09:18----------
it'll overheat yeah and it already

---------09:19----------
overheats because it's an Apple product

---------09:21----------
before you've actually yeah and that's I

---------09:26----------
found you eating screw thank you Mark

---------09:31----------
yeah it overheats already my hope is

---------09:36----------
that even though they reflow or the GPU

---------09:38----------
that it still has a chance of the GPU

---------09:41----------
not being dead I'm only hoping that they

---------09:43----------
use some sort of normal heating profile

---------09:45----------
rather than just full-on Heat you can

---------09:51----------
still use it you could still do a

---------09:52----------
profile with it as long as you didn't

---------09:56----------
just paint strip it from here two or

---------09:57----------
three minutes up here half a minute over

---------10:00----------
here there's no seconds there 10 seconds

---------10:04----------
here then back you know you can do

---------10:07----------
something resembling a profile if you

---------10:08----------
have a brain but if you have a brain you

---------10:10----------
probably wouldn't do this oh my god

---------10:12----------
another long screw no no no this is edgy

---------10:17----------
this may not be that bad this is just

---------10:19----------
the torn off screw grommet let's see

---------10:20----------
I'll defer to mark since mark has the

---------10:22----------
expertise so what do you think the board

---------10:33----------
is sticking up in this area I don't like

---------10:36----------
that

---------10:52----------
all right let's see what our buck

---------10:54----------
converter on the other side looks like I

---------10:58----------
bet they never even touched it oh it

---------11:05----------
looks like somebody actually may have

---------11:07----------
already tried that fix after they did

---------11:09----------
all of that yep somebody already did try

---------11:26----------
to do the thing yeah that is not

---------11:29----------
original solder yeah yeah you you

---------11:33----------
destroyed this sorry dwell rest in

---------11:40----------
pieces oh man not to bake the greatest

---------11:51----------
but it is soldered is that it looks like

---------11:57----------
it's been scrapped scraped a lot I got

---------12:00----------
to see if I have another one of these I

---------12:01----------
don't know if I trust this one should I

---------12:06----------
waste the chip on this to the chippy

---------12:12----------
wait hmm

---------12:17----------
damn you destroyed this little board you

---------12:21----------
poor little MacBook

---------12:58----------
this is why it's important to have a

---------13:00----------
couple of easy jobs you just knock a cap

---------13:02----------
off so your soul doesn't get destroyed

---------13:10----------
this stuff is soul destroying enough

---------13:13----------
time of this was so easy this didn't

---------13:20----------
need for this to happen to it

---------13:48----------
you sad little MacBook

---------13:51----------
I'm so sorry they hurt you

---------14:03----------
Tirion says this MacBook should go to

---------14:05----------
Paul I tend to agree with you there yeah

---------14:09----------
there's probably shorts under the GPU or

---------14:10----------
something rip I took it to a local

---------14:13----------
technician he told me that he needs to

---------14:15----------
change DP you I believe he didn't

---------14:17----------
couldn't fix it didn't charge me because

---------14:18----------
so it's hard to believe that he changed

---------14:20----------
the GPU and didn't charge me I really

---------14:21----------
don't know what he did but he told me

---------14:23----------
that it worked

---------14:23----------
he worked on it for almost the day and

---------14:25----------
couldn't get it fixed technician did

---------14:27----------
something this tech that worked on this

---------14:33----------
was

---------14:46----------
put this back in d14 hi hi today is a

---------14:48----------
really depressing day you had a better

---------14:50----------
chance with that being fixed if you sent

---------14:52----------
it to techrax it's alright let's show

---------14:56----------
you how that's actually supposed to be

---------14:57----------
done when you're not when you don't

---------14:59----------
destroy the board and I feel really bad

---------15:03----------
for the guy that said that gave this to

---------15:05----------
that / technician because this was a

---------15:07----------
fixable problem that was made unfixable

---------15:09----------
by somebody who just hates little mac

---------15:14----------
books it's not the Mac books fault it

---------15:17----------
didn't decide to be born a MacBook you

---------15:21----------
don't choose how you're born you

---------15:22----------
shouldn't hate somebody for how they're

---------15:24----------
born so you think you reflow the GPU and

---------15:28----------
then looked up like what what else could

---------15:30----------
cause this problem and then after you

---------15:33----------
can't put too much heat in that part of

---------15:34----------
the board because it has a lot of stress

---------15:36----------
because it's stressed a lot so if you'd

---------15:38----------
if you actually use hot air for a long

---------15:40----------
time in the on that chip it winds up

---------15:42----------
fracturing the board and then it doesn't

---------15:44----------
work at all he also probably didn't

---------15:45----------
replace the GPU I'm guessing that here

---------15:47----------
afloat and they're the shorts under the

---------15:48----------
GPU and even if none of that was true

---------15:51----------
then all the long screw destruction

---------15:53----------
right next to it it would have

---------15:55----------
definitely been because you can see it's

---------15:56----------
not just that this long screw it's that

---------15:58----------
there's a bump in the board right next

---------15:59----------
to it I don't know how he did that but

---------16:01----------
so see this machine now this is the same

---------16:05----------
model as the one I just showed you but

---------16:07----------
there's a couple of differences here so

---------16:08----------
firstly on the heatsink you'll notice

---------16:10----------
that none of the black paint or that

---------16:12----------
enameled stuff is ripped off at all

---------16:14----------
you'll notice that all the screw holes

---------16:16----------
are intact and you'll notice that the

---------16:17----------
edge bonding is still around the GPU

---------16:19----------
this is the same machine it has the same

---------16:21----------
defect and I'm going to show you how

---------16:23----------
this should be reassembled and I'm only

---------16:27----------
gonna finish this video because I want

---------16:28----------
to send it to that guy so that he can go

---------16:31----------
back to the person who did this to him

---------16:32----------
and shove a spiked one of these up his

---------16:35----------
rectum

---------16:36----------
I'm kidding you shouldn't do that that's

---------16:37----------
wrong you should let the legal system do

---------16:40----------
that for him

---------16:45----------
okay so we take this apart see all of

---------16:48----------
these screws can come out very easily

---------16:50----------
without ripping the paint off but when

---------16:53----------
you put it back in you want to screw

---------16:56----------
yeah and you want to use the longest

---------16:58----------
screw in the shortest hold area yeah you

---------17:05----------
have to use a dremel at 35 this little

---------17:09----------
MacBook did not choose to be a MacBook

---------17:11----------
that's no reason to abuse it you can be

---------17:14----------
mean to the people that decided that

---------17:16----------
this little MacBook would be born broken

---------17:19----------
or the people that abused it you can be

---------17:23----------
mean to the mom that chose to get drunk

---------17:25----------
while she was pregnant but not to the

---------17:27----------
child who's born afterwards it's not

---------17:29----------
this MacBooks fault that the engineers

---------17:31----------
that designed it were wasted the entire

---------17:33----------
time it didn't choose to grow up like

---------17:36----------
this there's no need to long screw it

---------17:38----------
just because of how it was born I saw

---------17:39----------
your message Genoa

---------17:40----------
it can cause quarter fan Spanish just

---------17:43----------
logging into that questions thing as a

---------17:44----------
pain in the ass so I wind up saving all

---------17:46----------
the questions till the end of the week

---------17:47----------
the two things that will cause quarter

---------17:49----------
fan spin on that is a blown are 70 51 or

---------17:51----------
are 70 52 which looks fine but is not

---------17:53----------
fine right next to this little under

---------17:55----------
filled audio or Thunderbolt amplifier or

---------17:58----------
a transistor and the other thing is that

---------18:01----------
is corrosion around your clock but that

---------18:04----------
stops at 2013 when they started using a

---------18:06----------
different clock chip that doesn't have

---------18:07----------
that problem see if you remove this very

---------18:14----------
carefully the tweezers are not gonna

---------18:15----------
touch the board it's only gonna touch

---------18:17----------
the webcam lift up and to the right so

---------18:20----------
we don't rip it you Inc high it's gonna

---------18:24----------
be doing this soon enough you've seen

---------18:27----------
how not to do the stuff many many times

---------18:29----------
which means I'm confident that you know

---------18:31----------
how to do it the right way yeah you

---------18:33----------
gotta go through and show them all the

---------18:35----------
ways things can go wrong first yeah

---------18:38----------
let's take a look at the buck converter

---------18:40----------
on this board and these are some awful

---------18:43----------
solder joints yeah

---------18:48----------
usually you can see one that's cracked

---------18:50----------
or coming away so I just have to up the

---------18:52----------
exposure on the camera get it in focus

---------19:00----------
turn my light a little down because

---------19:02----------
that's too much

---------19:12----------
yeah it was like little blobs okay

---------19:24----------
we're going to put one mill up all the

---------19:26----------
flux that's at least six thousand Paul's

---------19:41----------
that's a Giga paw that's

---------19:49----------
tweezers so when did you start using

---------19:53----------
when I got this station for you and I

---------19:56----------
moved up here since I I got the tweezers

---------19:59----------
for Paul and Camille I just never got

---------20:01----------
them for me because I'm cheap and I

---------20:04----------
didn't think I deserved them

---------20:12----------
they're a nice luxury they're necessary

---------20:15----------
for the iPhone and I like using them to

---------20:24----------
refurbish resistors as well yeah

---------20:31----------
the Fluxus out of stock because of Kevin

---------20:36----------
because Luis uses one to her chip

---------20:41----------
because Paul uses too much

---------20:59----------
okay move the flux over there

---------21:08----------
I haven't ruined a single set of tips

---------21:10----------
for these either yeah I don't know if

---------21:15----------
they're more adorable than the tips for

---------21:17----------
the other stuff that I have that the

---------21:19----------
micro pencil I go through tips for that

---------21:20----------
all the time

---------21:21----------
I used that the the knife tip but I

---------21:30----------
still killed it all the time yeah

---------21:43----------
okay so look at what the Apple solder

---------21:46----------
joints look like compared to these isn't

---------21:49----------
it nice

---------21:50----------
gonna pretty so the right side is the

---------21:57----------
OEM solder joints and the left top and

---------22:01----------
bottom are the new ones and we're

---------22:04----------
sucking up all that junky old junky junk

---------22:09----------
look different look darker because

---------22:12----------
they're the proper ski slope shaped

---------22:15----------
joints that reflect the color of the

---------22:17----------
board back

---------22:24----------
and all the old junk is getting sucked

---------22:25----------
up onto the solder blob there so that's

---------22:30----------
why I'm adding a bunch I mean not all of

---------22:31----------
it is sticking to the board I just want

---------22:33----------
to have a nice vat of it on my tweezers

---------22:35----------
and all of the old stuff to get sucked

---------22:38----------
up onto the tweezers themselves and

---------22:42----------
because I have some sick twisted form of

---------22:44----------
OCD I have to go in color in all the

---------22:46----------
little pro points

---------22:47----------
it's like color I used to do this in

---------22:50----------
school to make instead of reading the

---------22:52----------
book I would be coloring in the stuff on

---------22:54----------
the cover like I just have to it

---------22:57----------
triggers me seeing those little pro

---------22:58----------
points there it helps Adorama

---------23:22----------
all right and we have done the job using

---------23:25----------
one Milla Paul or flux

---------23:31----------
now

---------23:36----------
look at how much nicer this all looks

---------23:50----------
notice how by most of the traces by the

---------23:53----------
pads you don't see rips by each of the

---------23:56----------
individual traces like I didn't rip

---------23:58----------
anything off at the traces while I was

---------24:00----------
soldering even though I was going and

---------24:01----------
really hard on that board going in fast

---------24:09----------
and hard that's the first thing so all

---------24:13----------
of these even though I was like really

---------24:14----------
going plant yeah you don't see that

---------24:17----------
there's any rips on any of those

---------24:19----------
individual traces that are going the

---------24:22----------
decoding isn't ripped off and my screw

---------24:27----------
holes do not have any marks on the board

---------24:32----------
where I've stabbed them

---------24:37----------
and the board is not lifting up on

---------24:39----------
naturally in areas because I've beaten

---------24:41----------
it to death now we're going to see if

---------24:44----------
this produces an image and since we

---------24:49----------
didn't use too much flux we use just the

---------24:51----------
right amount you could see that's

---------24:52----------
practically nothing on my mat over here

---------24:54----------
because we use the right amount the

---------24:57----------
right amount of flux available soon and

---------25:05----------
we'll never be out of stock again once

---------25:07----------
Paul fixes the inventory system so that

---------25:08----------
Kevin can no longer sabotage it so at

---------25:11----------
the end of the week you can sell that

---------25:12----------
rag as a flux rag yeah it's gonna have

---------25:15----------
at least two tubes in it rears certified

---------25:25----------
pre-owned flux tested all right now

---------25:29----------
let's see if we get an image on this I

---------25:30----------
have a cat her name is blackberry she

---------25:33----------
goes broke she's so cute I love my kitty

---------25:39----------
you do a really good mark said that she

---------25:43----------
was a prissy [ __ ] the other day Marcus

---------25:47----------
she is she's snooty mark is gonna come

---------25:49----------
home to find his belongings outside

---------25:57----------
you have an Apple logo look it all so if

---------26:00----------
we were to check a GPU vcore we have 0.9

---------26:06----------
volts that's how it's supposed to be

---------26:08----------
done versus how it's not supposed to be

---------26:10----------
done so that's it for watching and as

---------26:12----------
always I hope you learned something and

---------26:13----------
to the individual who owns the computer

---------26:15----------
that we featured in the first stream

---------26:16----------
from the bottom of my heart I am very

---------26:18----------
very sorry that somebody in your country

---------26:20----------
decided to do that to your poor little

---------26:22----------
MacBook it deserved better it did with

---------26:26----------
that I'll see you in the next video
