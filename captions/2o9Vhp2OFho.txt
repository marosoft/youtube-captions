---------00:00----------
hi today I'd like to talk about why I

---------00:01----------
think it's really really important that

---------00:03----------
you do your own motherboard repair if

---------00:05----------
you're a store that offers laptop repair

---------00:06----------
or liquid damage repair of any kind and

---------00:08----------
you know I just want to kind of go over

---------00:10----------
some some trip down memory lane here

---------00:12----------
from a company that we used to outsource

---------00:14----------
to a long time ago so this as you can

---------00:16----------
see this is this is this is

---------00:18----------
ancient garbage but this this board had

---------00:21----------
an issue you guys can guess you guys who

---------00:25----------
have been watching this channel for a

---------00:26----------
while what was the original issue at

---------00:28----------
this point so let me just show you into

---------00:30----------
the microscope what what they will end

---------00:32----------
up doing to it and what wound up

---------00:33----------
happening so we wound up getting this

---------00:35----------
thing back and it was it didn't work and

---------00:37----------
it looks like this so when we contacted

---------00:47----------
them they said that all the guy what he

---------00:50----------
did was he couldn't get it to boot into

---------00:52----------
an operating system but to make sure

---------00:54----------
that he could get video he booted it

---------00:56----------
into a Linux live CD and he did not boot

---------00:59----------
into a graphical environment because he

---------01:01----------
couldn't get it to boot into a graphical

---------01:02----------
environment so once that worked they

---------01:05----------
considered it fixed send it back a

---------01:07----------
hundred something bucks and that's that

---------01:10----------
yeah I mean obviously this is not gonna

---------01:12----------
boot in a Mac os10 if it can't even boot

---------01:14----------
in the xfce but it would boot

---------01:16----------
into a command-line and when we talked

---------01:19----------
to the the owner about that then he

---------01:20----------
talked to his technician the technician

---------01:22----------
talked back to him what resulted was a

---------01:25----------
large deal of fury and rage at the fact

---------01:29----------
that they wasted a chip that he could

---------01:31----------
not get paid on and here's the thing you

---------01:34----------
know with stuff like this it may have

---------01:36----------
been just as unfixable here as it would

---------01:38----------
have been there but the difference is if

---------01:40----------
I'm doing the board repair here I can

---------01:42----------
tell my customer in one day or two days

---------01:45----------
exactly what the deal is every time they

---------01:47----------
call in instead of saying we have no no

---------01:49----------
Spanish updates at this time we can say

---------01:52----------
it's looking good or we can say this is

---------01:54----------
looking like a nightmare it's probably

---------01:55----------
not going to get done and here's the

---------01:57----------
thing about customer service when you

---------01:58----------
tell somebody upfront what the deal is

---------02:00----------
even if it's really really bad news they

---------02:03----------
can live with it they're gonna hate them

---------02:04----------
you know they're gonna hate their kid

---------02:05----------
for playing games with in bed with

---------02:08----------
pillows around the laptop they're gonna

---------02:09----------
hate themselves for dropping it they're

---------02:10----------
gonna hate you know their wife for

---------02:12----------
spilling water in it

---------02:13----------
I hate Apple for making a knock door a

---------02:15----------
little bit with with but they're not

---------02:16----------
gonna hate you but when you outsource it

---------02:18----------
and it takes you weeks upon weeks upon

---------02:21----------
weeks upon months to get stuff back and

---------02:22----------
you get back stuff like this and you

---------02:24----------
think it's working and you say okay the

---------02:25----------
status says it's good we should have

---------02:27----------
done in two days and it shows up like

---------02:28----------
this the problem is the problem that

---------02:31----------
you're gonna have is it's they're gonna

---------02:33----------
hate you they are going to hate you not

---------02:36----------
Apple not the person who broke it not

---------02:38----------
themselves they hate you and that sucks

---------02:41----------
and and honestly I understand where

---------02:45----------
they're understand why this happens I

---------02:47----------
cuz you know a lot of the stuff that

---------02:49----------
I've been getting since I started this

---------02:50----------
YouTube channel so the board repairs I

---------02:51----------
used to get or you know easy breezy

---------02:54----------
beautiful covergirl like stuff that was

---------02:56----------
basic simple I spend 10 or 20 minutes

---------02:59----------
I'm done now the stuff that I'm getting

---------03:01----------
is just completely sodomized garbage I

---------03:04----------
mean missing balls under the SMC missing

---------03:06----------
pads near the PCH no clock signal is el

---------03:10----------
Circo destroyed five and one to five

---------03:12----------
circuit destroyed back light circuit

---------03:13----------
destroyed v core circuit destroyed every

---------03:16----------
single SMC sensor circuit destroyed and

---------03:18----------
when I take on that job and I actually

---------03:21----------
do it there may be a chance that one of

---------03:23----------
those little corroded piles of just

---------03:24----------
so happen to corrode further on the way

---------03:26----------
back to you but the thing is if you are

---------03:29----------
outsourcing it you don't really know

---------03:31----------
what kind of the condition and what's

---------03:33----------
going on and all that stuff the same way

---------03:34----------
that you do when you're the one looking

---------03:36----------
at it when you're the one working on it

---------03:37----------
when you're the one who know who has

---------03:40----------
that direct communication with your

---------03:41----------
customer so when I am doing this work if

---------03:44----------
I see a board that's totally destroyed

---------03:46----------
and I know that somebody that wants a

---------03:48----------
one-day turnaround I can set their

---------03:50----------
expectation accordingly and say here

---------03:52----------
whereas if somebody has an expectation

---------03:55----------
of one or two weeks and they come in and

---------03:57----------
it's something basic I can say okay I'll

---------03:59----------
take it and that kind of communication

---------04:01----------
gets lost in outsourcing the other thing

---------04:03----------
that I want to mention that's something

---------04:04----------
that is you know I know it's something

---------04:06----------
that a lot of people don't want to admit

---------04:07----------
or talk about but it is in fact true so

---------04:10----------
when you're outsourcing to a store or a

---------04:11----------
business like one of these like mine you

---------04:14----------
know when people walk in the door and

---------04:15----------
then they went to Apple where the price

---------04:17----------
was 750 to 1,800 depending on the model

---------04:20----------
of the machine they are more than happy

---------04:23----------
to pay the three to 400 whatever here

---------04:25----------
too

---------04:26----------
the board and the other liquid damage

---------04:27----------
crap fixed but when you're dealing with

---------04:30----------
the store they are you know my

---------04:32----------
experience most of the time is that they

---------04:33----------
absolutely and crap themselves at

---------04:36----------
$200 which is sometimes understandable

---------04:39----------
because sometimes people will send me

---------04:40----------
boards from 2010 that are worth 200 when

---------04:42----------
they work and asked me to fix them and

---------04:45----------
you have to realize like in the in the

---------04:47----------
pile and in the scheme of things I'm you

---------04:49----------
know people who want to pay retail price

---------04:52----------
and are happy then on the bottom of the

---------04:54----------
pile are going to be people who don't

---------04:56----------
want to pay wholesale price and are kind

---------04:59----------
of complaining about so people who come

---------05:01----------
into my store directly not indirectly

---------05:04----------
through another business so people who

---------05:05----------
either mailed me a device directly or

---------05:07----------
people who walked in my store directly

---------05:08----------
they ultimately are going to get that

---------05:11----------
type of priority treatment not only just

---------05:13----------
because they're paying more but also

---------05:15----------
because they chose me so the fact that

---------05:19----------
they chose me meant that you know I am

---------05:22----------
your my priority over the customer that

---------05:25----------
then shows somebody else that then sent

---------05:27----------
it here and that that doesn't even have

---------05:29----------
to do with price and it may not seem

---------05:31----------
fair but it is what it is and it also

---------05:33----------
has to do with let's say just business

---------05:35----------
reputation so other businesses that are

---------05:37----------
going to send work in they are never

---------05:39----------
going to leave a positive review in fact

---------05:42----------
other businesses usually don't want

---------05:44----------
their customers to know that they

---------05:45----------
outsource this work they have no

---------05:47----------
interest in letting their customers know

---------05:48----------
that they mail it off because they don't

---------05:50----------
have the capability to do it so what

---------05:52----------
you're gonna find if you're a business

---------05:53----------
that caters to wholesale clients is that

---------05:56----------
it's going to be really difficult to

---------05:58----------
build a reputation because you're not

---------05:59----------
going to get those five-star reviews on

---------06:01----------
this all the different social media

---------06:03----------
platforms because you know when you do a

---------06:05----------
bad job

---------06:06----------
pee-yew you'll hear you'll you'll see

---------06:08----------
your name on the internet but when you

---------06:09----------
do a good job you often won't see your

---------06:11----------
information out there because the store

---------06:14----------
doesn't want others to know that you're

---------06:17----------
the one doing the work you know just

---------06:18----------
that's how it is so and again what I

---------06:22----------
notice is that the most destroyed boards

---------06:24----------
recently I've just been coming from

---------06:25----------
wholesale people where they are just I

---------06:26----------
look at it and it just looks like

---------06:28----------
somebody pissed on it with acid but in

---------06:31----------
another so the other thing about not

---------06:32----------
outsourcing that's really great comes

---------06:33----------
with this port over here so this is a

---------06:35----------
board that has been sitting here for so

---------06:37----------
 long that this actually dates

---------06:39----------
back to

---------06:40----------
a lot of board repair he was outsourced

---------06:42----------
I mean this is this this has been I

---------06:45----------
don't know why we didn't recycle this

---------06:46----------
but this has been sitting here for a

---------06:48----------
really really really long time I

---------06:51----------
mean just really long and the person

---------06:54----------
came in to pick it up and it didn't work

---------06:55----------
now here's the thing again here's the

---------06:57----------
thing with the whole mailing out process

---------06:59----------
sometimes it's because the board

---------07:01----------
repairer is an idiot sometimes it's

---------07:02----------
because they are just overworked and the

---------07:04----------
board is destroyed and they just miss

---------07:06----------
something it happens sometimes people

---------07:08----------
miss things I know that I miss things

---------07:10----------
every now and then but the thing is if I

---------07:11----------
miss something and somebody comes in and

---------07:13----------
pick up Steve can walk to the back and

---------07:15----------
say like Louis what the and I can

---------07:17----------
go okay flip the iron on whoops think of

---------07:19----------
him and fix it without sourcing what you

---------07:22----------
have to do is say oh I'm sorry that'll

---------07:24----------
be another oh I'm not really sure how

---------07:26----------
long because I don't really know how to

---------07:27----------
fix this and I don't know how long it's

---------07:28----------
gonna take and now know what have a

---------07:29----------
problem it is sorry

---------07:31----------
and what you're gonna find is that your

---------07:32----------
customers are not really happy hearing

---------07:34----------
that as an option they're not gonna be

---------07:35----------
happy with that Khoda lack of

---------07:36----------
information again that's what it cuz

---------07:38----------
that's what's gonna be what makes them

---------07:39----------
mad at you it's not even gonna be the

---------07:41----------
situation it's going to be how you

---------07:42----------
present the situation and the fact that

---------07:44----------
you have no information on what's going

---------07:46----------
on so with this machine so this was

---------07:50----------
Hannah again look we're gonna go over

---------07:51----------
this and we're gonna make this thing

---------07:52----------
work and because I you know I can kind

---------07:57----------
of see what the guy did and I'm gonna

---------07:59----------
follow along and the footsteps of that

---------08:02----------
most likely very very overworked person

---------08:04----------
and we're gonna see what's going on with

---------08:07----------
it so this is an eight to zero 2879

---------08:09----------
motherboard which is really really

---------08:11----------
really old

---------08:12----------
I usually you know I highly encourage

---------08:14----------
people to not have these fixed because

---------08:16----------
it's something else you're just gonna go

---------08:19----------
wrong with it again so when I plug in

---------08:21----------
the charger let's take this

---------08:23----------
antique and toss it in there so when I

---------08:25----------
plug in the charger

---------08:34----------
let's see there's no green light so the

---------08:37----------
first thing I'm going to measure is the

---------08:39----------
PP 3 V 4 2 line because that's required

---------08:42----------
for communication with the charger so

---------08:44----------
what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna walk

---------08:46----------
through the process of trying to figure

---------08:48----------
out why this has no green light so what

---------08:50----------
I have a green light you're supposed to

---------08:51----------
have the 3 point 42 volt rail and when I

---------08:57----------
check for the 3 point 42 volt rail I

---------09:04----------
have 0 volts now one of the hints here

---------09:08----------
that the three point 42 volt rail at one

---------09:09----------
time had ripple or was worked on is

---------09:12----------
going to be covered under the microscope

---------09:15----------
here so this here is u 6901 which i've

---------09:21----------
gone over in many many one wire circuit

---------09:23----------
video so feel free to search for that if

---------09:25----------
you are confused so you can see that

---------09:28----------
this probably had a 1 wire circuit

---------09:29----------
problem originally and that one wire

---------09:31----------
circuit problem is why they had to fill

---------09:35----------
up this vo with solder and run some type

---------09:37----------
of wire and you can also see over here

---------09:39----------
that the P P 3 V 4 2 regulator was real

---------09:42----------
most likely replaced so what I'm

---------09:47----------
guessing happened here is they looked at

---------09:48----------
the top side of the border because they

---------09:49----------
were tired they didn't look at the

---------09:50----------
bottom side of the board now when we

---------09:52----------
look at the bottom side of the board

---------09:54----------
this here is the resistor that goes

---------09:57----------
between the DC and the DCM so from the

---------10:01----------
adapter and the P P 3 V 4 2 power supply

---------10:03----------
input so what I'm guessing happened here

---------10:05----------
is that that resistor most likely was

---------10:07----------
not looked at because they did all the

---------10:09----------
work on this with one side of the

---------10:10----------
computer so let's just take a look and

---------10:12----------
see what that measures and see if I'm

---------10:14----------
correct so that resistor is usually

---------10:16----------
something like 10 or I would guess

---------10:20----------
something like 10 ohms 10 ohms or 47

---------10:24----------
ohms

---------10:24----------
I'm not really sure at the moment I

---------10:26----------
should probably look that up so let's

---------10:28----------
just switch over to screen capture which

---------10:32----------
is not working great window capture here

---------10:35----------
we go

---------10:36----------
okay we're on window capture now so

---------10:40----------
let's go to you $6.99

---------10:44----------
zero over here so between the DCN board

---------10:48----------
and here hey nice try

---------10:51----------
so between the DCN board in here you're

---------10:53----------
supposed to get one ohm on our six nine

---------10:56----------
oh five and let's just go over to the

---------10:59----------
board view software just so that I can

---------11:00----------
confirm that that's it so for some

---------11:03----------
reason my display capture is not working

---------11:05----------
so I have to use window capture the only

---------11:07----------
thing is every time I switch back and

---------11:08----------
forth between windows it you know I have

---------11:11----------
to actually change the setting and open

---------11:13----------
broadcaster which really sucks it's

---------11:15----------
something that I have to look into so

---------11:16----------
let's just go back over here and change

---------11:20----------
the window yay what a waste of time okay

---------11:23----------
so that resistor I'm guessing is this

---------11:26----------
one over here

---------11:27----------
so yeah r6 905 see right on the bottom

---------11:30----------
left to the screen where it says r6 905

---------11:32----------
so now I'm gonna switch back over to the

---------11:34----------
this view the microscope I'll show you

---------11:37----------
how I'm gonna measure the resistor so I

---------11:39----------
put one lead on the bottom the other

---------11:41----------
lead on the top and what I get on my

---------11:43----------
multimeter let's just show ya

---------11:45----------
let's see if you have a view of the

---------11:47----------
multimeter yeah barely

---------11:51----------
yeah barely gotta get an HDMI I have to

---------11:55----------
get the Fluke 15 B with HDMI output yeah

---------11:59----------
the light from the ceiling is owning it

---------12:00----------
let's see we do that hello let's see if

---------12:03----------
you can see the resistance once I get

---------12:05----------
out of the way now the resistance that

---------12:08----------
I'm getting is fifty nine point six

---------12:09----------
killa homes whereas the schematics is

---------12:11----------
the resistance supposed to be one hope

---------12:13----------
and that's no good that's not what's

---------12:16----------
supposed to be happening here so that

---------12:18----------
resistor was probably you know it didn't

---------12:20----------
look really amazing and you could see

---------12:23----------
that there is a little spot right over

---------12:26----------
here where it's you know this side looks

---------12:28----------
good that side looks like it's seen

---------12:30----------
better days but again this is the thing

---------12:37----------
you know get when you're doing the work

---------12:38----------
you you're gonna care about your own

---------12:40----------
customers more than somebody else is

---------12:42----------
going to the game and that's that's just

---------12:43----------
the way the world works you know you may

---------12:45----------
not like it you may say it's unfair but

---------12:47----------
this this is also this is just the way

---------12:49----------
the world works you know

---------12:50----------
other people are not going to care about

---------12:53----------
your customers the same way that you

---------12:55----------
care about your customers and if you

---------12:59----------
want to do this type of work it's it's a

---------13:03----------
lot easier to deal with all the

---------13:05----------
potential nightmares that come up when

---------13:07----------
you're the one who's do fix it so again

---------13:10----------
you know this this person decided

---------13:12----------
they're gonna go out to lunch and

---------13:14----------
they're totally fine with the fact that

---------13:15----------
it's gonna take a little longer because

---------13:17----------
they left their computer here from you

---------13:20----------
know over three years so

---------13:31----------
there's not really much room for them to

---------13:33----------
complain about having to wait 10 minutes

---------13:35----------
inside waited since in 2011-12

---------13:46----------
okay now we get a resistor to put over

---------13:50----------
there

---------14:22----------
it is crooked which is the hallmark of

---------14:24----------
almost everything I do in life but what

---------14:31----------
am I gonna do

---------14:50----------
so some even out the stuff on the

---------14:55----------
sides that blobbed out you're scraping

---------14:57----------
and then some hot air is going to move

---------15:00----------
that into place so that it looks nice

---------15:02----------
and sits properly

---------15:11----------
beautiful now I'm going to check and

---------15:20----------
make sure there's no short to ground on

---------15:21----------
both sides before turning this back on

---------15:34----------
no short to ground on one side of the

---------15:36----------
resistor and short to ground on other

---------15:43----------
side of the resistor great okay

---------15:46----------
so now the only thing that could be

---------15:49----------
shorted is C 6990 so I'm gonna look on

---------15:52----------
the board view for C 6990 here and you

---------16:02----------
can get replaced as well

---------17:42----------
just making sure that the capacitor that

---------17:44----------
I took was the same voltage rating and

---------17:47----------
also microfarad rating so 10 microfarad

---------17:51----------
25 volts okay now let's make sure that

---------17:57----------
the short to ground is disappeared on

---------18:00----------
the meter read probe ground black probe

---------18:03----------
one that's out of here short to ground

---------18:06----------
is gone so when I plug this in it should

---------18:09----------
turn on so what do I get do I get a

---------18:12----------
green light I do not get a green light

---------18:22----------
ha am I being trolled I believe I am now

---------18:36----------
let's take a look at the rest of that

---------18:38----------
beautiful handiwork is that thing

---------18:43----------
soldered well I would bet no

---------19:32----------
or I had nothing on pp3 before to now I

---------19:35----------
have one volt which is better and it's

---------19:43----------
definitely progress but what I'm ideally

---------19:48----------
looking for is three point four

---------20:14----------
last that resistor is actually back so

---------20:17----------
the resistor that I put on in place of

---------20:18----------
the one that I said was bad was also bad

---------20:21----------
beautiful dum-dum-dum this one so what I

---------20:29----------
need here is a 1 ohm resistor that can

---------20:31----------
take a lot of power you know what

---------20:51----------
one ohm resistor that can take a lot of

---------20:53----------
power

---------21:05----------
Matt Subic here we go

---------22:36----------
I'm gonna have to find a better looking

---------22:38----------
resistor than that I just wanted to

---------22:39----------
finish the video and get the point

---------22:41----------
across so the whole idea here is again

---------22:43----------
this this could have went one of two

---------22:45----------
ways if I was doing outsourcing this

---------22:47----------
could have went where I'm sending this

---------22:49----------
back and I'm waiting weeks and weeks and

---------22:51----------
weeks and there's a real real

---------22:53----------
uncomfortable conversation I have or

---------22:54----------
this could go where I am talking to them

---------22:57----------
and saying you know give it gimme a now

---------22:59----------
or go get lunch and come back and it's

---------23:01----------
gonna happen you're gonna get owned if

---------23:03----------
your business is based on working on

---------23:04----------
liquid damaged stuff the way that mine

---------23:06----------
is sometimes you're just going to get

---------23:08----------
owned it's just it is what it is and

---------23:10----------
that's an something that you have to

---------23:11----------
explain your customer isn't that they

---------23:13----------
have to understand before you start

---------23:14----------
working on their liquid damaged pile of

---------23:16----------
crap but at the same time you can avoid

---------23:20----------
getting owned if you're the one doing

---------23:22----------
the work because when you're the one

---------23:23----------
doing the work when any any time any one

---------23:25----------
of these little mishaps comes up you can

---------23:29----------
resolve it in your office instead of

---------23:30----------
having to resolve it by wasting a lot of

---------23:32----------
time in making somebody really unhappy

---------23:34----------
so with with this whole YouTube video

---------23:37----------
series and the board repair training

---------23:40----------
that I've had going on what I'm trying

---------23:42----------
to do is I'm trying to reduce your

---------23:44----------
dependency on outsourcing so that your

---------23:46----------
business can deal with these types of

---------23:49----------
hassles and issues without them becoming

---------23:51----------
large you know customer nightmare

---------23:53----------
cluster by being able to resolve

---------23:56----------
them quickly at your own store so I hope

---------23:58----------
that that's been helpful I hope the

---------24:00----------
classes have been helpful I hope the

---------24:01----------
online free videos have been helpful in

---------24:03----------
getting you one step closer to be able

---------24:05----------
to deliver better service for your

---------24:06----------
customers
