---------00:00----------
all right so today we're going to be

---------00:01----------
going over a macbook pro that does not

---------00:03----------
have a left click and if I plug in a

---------00:06----------
mouse I can right click but I can't

---------00:08----------
left-click now on a laptop this is a

---------00:11----------
problem that you could solve by simply

---------00:13----------
right-clicking whenever you needed to do

---------00:15----------
something there's many ways that you can

---------00:17----------
use the right-click but unfortunately

---------00:20----------
this is a macbook so we have click no

---------00:23----------
left click no right click just click so

---------00:26----------
if you can't click then you're

---------00:29----------
and there's no workaround so let's go

---------00:31----------
over what it is that may cause this so

---------00:33----------
the first thing we have to do is kind of

---------00:34----------
really understand this trackpad

---------00:37----------
circuitry and the way that this sends

---------00:40----------
messages to the CPU or the PCH to let it

---------00:43----------
know that something is being clicked so

---------00:44----------
the first thing that I would like to do

---------00:46----------
in one of these situations is I would

---------00:47----------
plug in a USB mouse so here I plugged in

---------00:50----------
my gaming mouse that I use for all my

---------00:53----------
dota games which is why I have won every

---------00:55----------
single match undefeated this is my

---------00:58----------
gaming mouse it comes free with any $40

---------01:01----------
DVR it eats its 3d it's a 3d optical

---------01:05----------
mouse it's a it's tested to comply with

---------01:10----------
FCC standards for a home or office use

---------01:12----------
even though it says home or office I

---------01:14----------
know this can be used for gaming and

---------01:16----------
when I plug that in I don't get any

---------01:19----------
click so over here I can just show you

---------01:21----------
how this machine looks you know the

---------01:23----------
focus is gonna be screwed up on the

---------01:24----------
camera cause it's set up to focus on my

---------01:26----------
face but is what it is so as you can see

---------01:28----------
it is moving but when I click on

---------01:30----------
something like this now it's gonna click

---------01:35----------
because I'm doing a video so you

---------01:39----------
gotta be what the this is

---------01:50----------
there's been like an hour

---------01:51----------
troubleshooting this piece of oh

---------01:56----------
yeah laughs laughs laughs no check it

---------02:00----------
out look it works now watch I'm gonna do

---------02:03----------
this hold down option and a scroll oh

---------02:06----------
you're on the track come on track bed

---------02:11----------
yeah once it's done with that little

---------02:13----------
loading bar then we'll let me move the

---------02:15----------
mouse around I'm gonna move the mouse

---------02:16----------
down here and it clicks you

---------02:22----------
piece of

---------02:26----------
no it's gonna register a click when its

---------02:29----------
high was it me literally touching that

---------02:32----------
probe with the multimeter that fixed it

---------02:35----------
okay let's see what it's measuring now

---------02:37----------
let's see if it's measuring something

---------02:38----------
different than it did before all right

---------02:39----------
just to give you an idea man that's

---------02:44----------
 all right so this is the

---------02:49----------
trackpad connector in this pic BL now

---------02:52----------
this is dumb because this is not a

---------02:54----------
guitar this is a trackpad you don't pick

---------02:57----------
a trackpad you press it every time you

---------02:59----------
press the trackpad pick B L goes from 3

---------03:03----------
point 4 volts to 0 volt so essentially

---------03:05----------
when you click the trackpad you are

---------03:07----------
shorting that signal to ground so it

---------03:08----------
means that it's being picked or pressed

---------03:10----------
when it is low underscore L that's pin 9

---------03:13----------
of the trackpad now the thing is we

---------03:14----------
can't measure pin 9 of the trackpad

---------03:16----------
because it's it's covered so like if I

---------03:18----------
were to show you what the connector

---------03:19----------
looks like right now it looks something

---------03:21----------
like this how the hell am I gonna fit my

---------03:24----------
multimeter under that just not happening

---------03:26----------
it's not happening so what I would do is

---------03:29----------
I would measure it where it's going on

---------03:31----------
the USB controller chip one of the USB

---------03:33----------
controller to the interpreter next to it

---------03:35----------
so this is what this thing does is it

---------03:37----------
takes the information from the trackpad

---------03:40----------
in the keyboard this up here it

---------03:42----------
takes the information from the trackpad

---------03:44----------
and the keyboard and it turns it into a

---------03:46----------
USB signal over here that the PCH will

---------03:51----------
understand and so let's see where that

---------03:55----------
shows up so we try to look for pic BL

---------03:59----------
you don't understand how annoying this

---------04:02----------
is I mean just just just think about it

---------04:03----------
think about this right I have to measure

---------04:05----------
so I have to put the left the the black

---------04:08----------
probe on ground the right probe on the

---------04:10----------
chip and then try to get my foot

---------04:12----------
on the desk or something I'll like click

---------04:14----------
the trackpad that's this no I think this

---------04:16----------
I just gave up and eventually I Jason

---------04:18----------
helped me click it but that this is

---------04:20----------
annoying so the fact that it just fixed

---------04:22----------
itself really pisses me off

---------04:23----------
so I went around measuring all this

---------04:26----------
horseshit so when we look over here I

---------04:30----------
measure pick BL that's gonna be on pin

---------04:33----------
52 so I go over here I find pin 52 and I

---------04:37----------
bet that this measures properly now

---------04:39----------
you prick nicely we went to do a

---------04:46----------
video this morning on something else and

---------04:48----------
the camera literally like it just might

---------04:51----------
sometimes the capture card will just act

---------04:52----------
funny and it was just flickering and

---------04:54----------
showing a funny image and then it showed

---------04:56----------
a ghost image where you could see the

---------04:57----------
board and then two showed nothing at all

---------04:58----------
and that repair didn't work this video

---------05:03----------
is working I got video I have audio

---------05:05----------
everything's working the way it's

---------05:07----------
supposed to fixes itself I mean you

---------05:10----------
can't make this stuff up anyway so if we

---------05:12----------
were to go over here you'll see that pic

---------05:16----------
BL is that's the thing it's two point

---------05:20----------
nine volts that should be higher that

---------05:21----------
should be closer to three point three

---------05:23----------
that still has not given me a great

---------05:24----------
feeling

---------05:25----------
so watch if I remove the trackpad let's

---------05:27----------
see if pic BL is yeah it's still the

---------05:32----------
same it's actually look at it look at it

---------05:36----------
two point nine one point seven two point

---------05:38----------
nine one point seven two point nine one

---------05:39----------
point seven either way I'm not gonna

---------05:41----------
trust this the others have to

---------05:42----------
believe me that this didn't actually

---------05:44----------
work before and the other thing I want

---------05:46----------
to talk about here the other thing I

---------05:48----------
want to talk about before we get in the

---------05:50----------
the actual figure they're a pair of

---------05:52----------
everything I want you to be able to

---------05:54----------
differentiate between not clicking and

---------05:56----------
not moving because these are actually

---------05:57----------
two different problems so if this chip

---------06:00----------
over here this this this interpreter

---------06:01----------
chip that's going to take the keyboard

---------06:04----------
and the trackpad information and turn it

---------06:05----------
into a USB signal if let's say if

---------06:07----------
there's an issue with this and it's not

---------06:09----------
clicking if pick BL is a you know is

---------06:12----------
always low and it's not registering a

---------06:14----------
click that's an issue over here however

---------06:16----------
if it's not moving then you have an

---------06:18----------
issue with the booster circuit so this

---------06:21----------
is a DC to DC boost circuit that is

---------06:23----------
going to take the 5 volts going into it

---------06:26----------
and it's going to turn it into 18 volts

---------06:28----------
for the trackpad so if you don't have 18

---------06:30----------
volts on the trackpad it's not going to

---------06:32----------
register when you touch it so you need

---------06:35----------
18 volts of the trackpad

---------06:37----------
to register you moving it and the click

---------06:39----------
is going to be a separate part

---------06:40----------
altogether the click is going to be that

---------06:42----------
pick BL section so you can have clicking

---------06:45----------
without having moving and you can have

---------06:47----------
moving without having clicking the other

---------06:49----------
thing that you should think about here

---------06:50----------
is also whether or not the trackpad

---------06:52----------
button has been disabled one of the

---------06:53----------
silly features that I find on this

---------06:55----------
machine is there's actually a feature

---------06:58----------
called button disabled and this is just

---------07:01----------
kind of I don't I don't really

---------07:03----------
understand what's going on here the

---------07:05----------
whole idea is SMC lid is a signal that

---------07:08----------
will be 3.42 volts when the computer is

---------07:10----------
open and it will be closer to zero or

---------07:14----------
lower when the computer is closed the

---------07:16----------
whole idea here is this transistor will

---------07:17----------
short button disable to ground so if the

---------07:20----------
computer is open then we will allow the

---------07:23----------
trackpad to work but if SMC slit is

---------07:25----------
closed if it's low then button disabled

---------07:28----------
will exist and button disabled will

---------07:30----------
disable the button the trackpad now the

---------07:32----------
reason that I think this is silly is

---------07:34----------
firstly you're causing another point of

---------07:37----------
failure if something goes wrong with

---------07:38----------
that transistor if something goes wrong

---------07:41----------
with that signal now the trackpad is not

---------07:43----------
going to work the second reason that I

---------07:44----------
think it's silly is I don't understand

---------07:46----------
the functionality of it if this computer

---------07:48----------
is closed the whole idea I get it

---------07:51----------
the trackpad is going to wake the

---------07:52----------
computer from sleep so if the computer

---------07:55----------
is closed we don't want the trackpad to

---------07:57----------
be clickable because then the computer

---------07:59----------
could wake from sleep while it's closed

---------08:00----------
my counter-argument is going to be how

---------08:03----------
the are you going to click the

---------08:05----------
trackpad while the computer is closed

---------08:07----------
like what do you have to do to this

---------08:09----------
thing to register a trackpad click while

---------08:11----------
it's closed because you can smack it you

---------08:13----------
can bash it you could bang it in it's

---------08:15----------
nothing like you would have to shoot

---------08:17----------
this computer you'd have to shoot it

---------08:19----------
with a gun had the bullet go all the way

---------08:21----------
through for it to register a click and

---------08:23----------
at that point you have much bigger

---------08:24----------
problems than your computer waking

---------08:25----------
wallets in sleep but that's just my

---------08:27----------
opinion anyway so that's another thing

---------08:29----------
that can cause the button to not work

---------08:32----------
now here I did measure that signal in

---------08:35----------
button disable was zero volts meaning

---------08:38----------
that button disabled is not present

---------08:40----------
meaning that the button will not be

---------08:42----------
disabled so what we have to do now is

---------08:44----------
the fun of replacing this chip because I

---------08:47----------
don't trust it it's doing funny things

---------08:49----------
and it's trolling me by not what a piece

---------08:52----------
of seriously they by working on

---------08:57----------
camera not working off camera

---------09:01----------
I'm telling you if you try to record

---------09:04----------
instructional videos or videos where

---------09:06----------
things go right it's just it just you'll

---------09:09----------
see everything will go wrong and then

---------09:11----------
when you want things to go wrong so you

---------09:12----------
could record yourself fixing them go go

---------09:14----------
right you try to do like a video Luis

---------09:19----------
loses the lottery how about that what do

---------09:23----------
you think Jason Madhu a video caught

---------09:25----------
Jason loses the lottery and see what the

---------09:28----------
results are so I'm gonna captain tape

---------09:31----------
all the stuff in the surrounding area

---------09:33----------
because I don't want to burn it too

---------09:34----------
badly and I applied the captain tape

---------09:40----------
very poorly over here so I put too much

---------09:43----------
of it turn on the hot air station turn

---------09:48----------
on the air filter I know this is a

---------09:51----------
different microphone I usually use the

---------09:52----------
DPA 4065 omnidirectional microphone the

---------09:55----------
reason is it is really good sound

---------09:57----------
quality and also when you place the

---------09:59----------
microphone it since it's an

---------10:01----------
omnidirectional microphone you can place

---------10:03----------
the microphone very very very close to

---------10:06----------
your mouth without getting proximity

---------10:07----------
effect or any of that stuff so having a

---------10:09----------
mic close to your mouth gives you a

---------10:11----------
higher signal-to-noise ratio the

---------10:13----------
increased signal of noise ratio means

---------10:15----------
that you hear less of the air filter so

---------10:17----------
if mine if I can make my voice louder by

---------10:20----------
putting them by putting the microphone

---------10:23----------
closer to my face that means I can lower

---------10:25----------
the gain if I lower the gain that means

---------10:26----------
you hear less air filter in fume

---------10:29----------
extractor now the trick here is that

---------10:34----------
still it's not a it's not a cardioid mic

---------10:37----------
it's an omni so it's gonna pick up from

---------10:38----------
everywhere this microphone is a cardioid

---------10:40----------
microphone so it's going to do so it's

---------10:43----------
gonna be a little bit sillier when it

---------10:44----------
comes to things like

---------10:46----------
like let's say it moves a little bit the

---------10:48----------
tone of my voice may change or may block

---------10:50----------
out sound rather than this have it go

---------10:52----------
lower for a second

---------10:53----------
if if it moves at all however it's gonna

---------10:57----------
block out from all sides so I'm kind of

---------10:58----------
curious how this how this sounds now the

---------11:00----------
reason I haven't used this for a while

---------11:02----------
is it's a DPA DPA stuff is very very

---------11:04----------
expensive very pricey and the thing that

---------11:07----------
with this microphone is that it didn't

---------11:10----------
come with this dual ear hook so see how

---------11:11----------
this has like a dual ear hook so it

---------11:13----------
hooks here in here if you don't have the

---------11:15----------
dual ear hook if you have the single

---------11:16----------
your hook it wobbles around like crazy

---------11:17----------
and the sound is constantly changing it

---------11:19----------
sounds like and it's worthless like

---------11:21----------
when I turn around I'm half the volume

---------11:22----------
than when I'm here because it moves that

---------11:25----------
banding and yeah we'll figure that out

---------11:27----------
later but so this is this dual ear hook

---------11:30----------
thing this thing that allows them I'm

---------11:31----------
not talking about the microphone I'm not

---------11:33----------
talking about the like a preamp or a

---------11:36----------
wireless thing I'm talking about the the

---------11:38----------
piece that the microphone clips into is

---------11:41----------
eighty-seven dollars plus tax I just I

---------11:45----------
was I was speechless when I saw

---------11:47----------
that so this thing's sat and had been

---------11:49----------
for five months because I couldn't bring

---------11:51----------
myself to spend eighty-seven dollars on

---------11:52----------
like I love DPA DPA makes good stuff in

---------11:55----------
the whole argument with it is you know

---------11:57----------
if you're buying DPA stuff then you

---------11:59----------
shouldn't be complaining about price

---------12:00----------
you're in a league where you shouldn't

---------12:01----------
complain about fries and I'll say I will

---------12:04----------
pay a lot of money for a good microphone

---------12:06----------
I'm okay with paying money for a

---------12:07----------
microphone this is a little like a

---------12:12----------
little a little hook that goes around my

---------12:14----------
ear eighty seven dollars plus tax holy

---------12:17----------
 alright so let's get started with

---------12:23----------
this we're going to remove this chip

---------12:28----------
and see if we get any changes now we're

---------12:33----------
gonna do our best enough around the

---------12:34----------
keyboard latch that'll be a bonus not

---------12:38----------
burning the keyboard latch will be a

---------12:39----------
bonus if I was smart I would take after

---------12:42----------
Jason and put a penny over the keyboard

---------12:44----------
latch but that's if I were smart leave

---------12:52----------
the what

---------12:55----------
yeah we'll just get started right onto

---------12:58----------
the board okay now I'm gonna use my

---------13:00----------
soldering iron to my soldering iron -

---------13:03----------
mother

---------13:06----------
HECO wants to charge me eleven dollars

---------13:09----------
to fix the other one even though it's

---------13:10----------
within warranty can you believe that and

---------13:13----------
you know I got tips eleven bucks to fix

---------13:16----------
it the outrage that's just one

---------13:20----------
of those battles that I just don't think

---------13:22----------
I'm gonna fight on one hand that thing

---------13:24----------
is within warranty and it did

---------13:26----------
feel like I didn't I didn't do anything

---------13:27----------
to it I didn't step on it I didn't

---------13:29----------
on it I didn't stab it it just stopped

---------13:33----------
recognizing tips one day it's a hot

---------13:34----------
swappable tip iron comes with a 250

---------13:37----------
something to 250 26 t dollar station at

---------13:40----------
the time on the other hand they're only

---------13:44----------
asking 11 bucks so I mean I can't really

---------13:48----------
there's an extent I mean like even if I

---------13:51----------
did want to argue with them and say like

---------13:52----------
hey I've spent thousands

---------13:56----------
and thousands of dollars on your

---------13:57----------
products other people have spent

---------13:59----------
thousands and thousands on my

---------14:01----------
recommendations I see this that

---------14:03----------
sells an Amazon affiliate every day blah

---------14:05----------
blah blah again the time it takes to say

---------14:07----------
all that is not worth the eleven dollars

---------14:10----------
it just isn't

---------14:14----------
but yeah if you buy any of the the it's

---------14:17----------
reasonable like it's not that's the

---------14:19----------
thing like I think it should be covered

---------14:20----------
under warranty I think it should be

---------14:22----------
covered under warranty but they're

---------14:25----------
asking for 11 bucks like if I thought it

---------14:27----------
should be covered under warranty and

---------14:28----------
they're asking for 100 bucks even 30

---------14:31----------
bucks

---------14:31----------
okay I'll argue but for 10 bucks what

---------14:35----------
the you gonna do you know fine

---------14:37----------
here take your $11 for your

---------14:42----------
defective ass a soldering handpiece that

---------14:46----------
couldn't make it from October of

---------14:50----------
last year to August of this year on the

---------14:55----------
RMA procedure is all leave Jesus do you

---------14:57----------
have the tip all the way in yes are you

---------14:58----------
sure you have the tip all the way in yes

---------15:00----------
are you sure you have the tip all the

---------15:01----------
way in yes I know I have a small tip you

---------15:04----------
can stop rubbing it in my face

---------15:05----------
hackle representative how often do I

---------15:10----------
like there are many times in life where

---------15:12----------
I'm gonna be reminded that I have a

---------15:13----------
small tip I just don't expect it to be

---------15:15----------
when I'm like dealing with my industrial

---------15:16----------
equipment supplier on Saturday night I

---------15:21----------
expect to be reminded that I have a

---------15:22----------
small tip this is one area in my life

---------15:26----------
where I don't want to feel inadequate

---------15:27----------
about my tip so it's gonna tend the pads

---------15:36----------
here you're gonna turn this stuff up

---------15:38----------
here and we're gonna and I am getting

---------15:43----------
too much solder on the center pad the

---------15:44----------
thing is that's a huge that's a huge

---------15:46----------
center pen that's the thing so I'm gonna

---------15:48----------
have to spread that sided out all

---------15:49----------
amongst the center pad anywhere soon I

---------15:51----------
think I like about this t15 Jaso to tip

---------15:54----------
from the company that I'm pissed that

---------15:55----------
right now but still promoting because I

---------15:57----------
have no idea how to market or if L

---------16:00----------
myself as a sponsor is that it in watch

---------16:05----------
see I was able to get each one of those

---------16:07----------
individual pads up there using the I was

---------16:09----------
using the very very fine tip but then I

---------16:12----------
can use the really really thick elbow to

---------16:14----------
get the centered pad that is just

---------16:18----------
beautiful so now we're going to take

---------16:20----------
that USB thingy from a donor board

---------16:24----------
because it comes with programming so I

---------16:25----------
can't buy it new

---------16:28----------
yay

---------16:30----------
if you buy that thing new it's not going

---------16:32----------
to do a damn thing for you we're gonna

---------16:37----------
take it off of a donor Swiper no swiping

---------16:44----------
you swiped

---------16:46----------
he stole my paper towel everybody steals

---------16:50----------
my paper towels because it's on the

---------16:52----------
spool oh yeah and I use the microscope

---------16:54----------
stand in the school and it's right next

---------16:55----------
to my desk my desk is right next to the

---------16:59----------
bathroom you know because the bathroom

---------17:01----------
is where people and that's what

---------17:02----------
that's what everybody here thinks of my

---------17:04----------
soldering so when they leave the

---------17:06----------
bathroom they just take the paper towels

---------17:07----------
from me and then I wind up with no paper

---------17:09----------
towels and I got to get up and get paper

---------17:10----------
towels and I think this is unfair and

---------17:15----------
I'm gonna start you know I'm gonna start

---------17:17----------
putting flux and castor 951 and

---------17:20----------
 on those paper towels see how

---------17:23----------
people like it this is totally defeating

---------17:28----------
the purpose of Captain T oh well alright

---------17:31----------
so let's get this heated and on there

---------17:52----------
Terry you have some excess solder on the

---------17:55----------
center pad story of my life and we're

---------17:58----------
just going to clean up around the chip

---------18:00----------
and once it's all cleaned up then we can

---------18:02----------
go and flow it zactly in a place so

---------18:05----------
right now my priority is getting the

---------18:07----------
chip to be flat on the paths

---------18:16----------
so we're gonna get this nice and flat on

---------18:18----------
the pads love this tip love I love my

---------18:27----------
tip I love my tip every day

---------18:34----------
I don't care if the hakko service

---------18:36----------
representative doesn't like my tip or

---------18:38----------
how I handle my tip or where I put my

---------18:40----------
tip

---------18:49----------
now let's

---------18:57----------
now the proper amount of solder is on

---------19:00----------
every pad

---------19:09----------
now we flow it into exactly where it's

---------19:11----------
supposed to be

---------19:18----------
crap

---------19:20----------
just I just destroyed that did not

---------19:34----------
the more you try to make something

---------19:36----------
perfect - the more you will just screw

---------19:37----------
it up so learn from my repeated mistakes

---------19:40----------
and stop doing that to yourself

---------19:52----------
make the area look a little nice nice

---------19:55----------
nice nice nice nice I just saw a solder

---------20:01----------
ball let's make sure that solder ball

---------20:03----------
didn't fly away where I can't see it I

---------20:07----------
am genuinely curious if this mic will

---------20:09----------
end up sounding better the same or worse

---------20:11----------
how is it at rejecting noise from the

---------20:13----------
air filter the air conditioner is having

---------20:16----------
a cardioid head Ward mic all that it's

---------20:18----------
made up to because I will say as much as

---------20:20----------
my older yes and thirty-five sounded

---------20:22----------
like a piece of you sounded like

---------20:25----------
you were underwater using that so I

---------20:26----------
would have to do it like you know 15 DB

---------20:28----------
boost at 3 killer it's for you to

---------20:30----------
actually hear me with that thing this is

---------20:32----------
ridiculous

---------20:33----------
yeah it did do a really interesting job

---------20:36----------
of blocking out all the noise very good

---------20:41----------
job of that but it was it was incredibly

---------20:43----------
uncomfortable and you add to the fact

---------20:45----------
that in addition to being incredibly

---------20:46----------
uncomfortable that it sounded like crap

---------21:04----------
okay sometime beautiful

---------21:19----------
see if we are at least not worse off

---------21:23----------
than we were before I hold down option

---------21:31----------
okay and can I quick I can click but I

---------21:42----------
could click before so now let's measure

---------21:48----------
and see if pic BL is any better than it

---------21:53----------
was before

---------21:55----------
so pic BL

---------22:07----------
pick BL how about the turn on the

---------22:13----------
multimeter you dumb all right

---------22:15----------
let's see if you can see that so before

---------22:17----------
was peeking before this was peeking at

---------22:20----------
two point nine volts two point eight

---------22:22----------
volts and right now with everything

---------22:24----------
plugged in it peaks at three point two

---------22:28----------
nine which is close to three point three

---------22:30----------
which is the voltage that this chip uses

---------22:32----------
for its own power

---------22:33----------
now one thing to realize a lot of people

---------22:34----------
are gonna say well how do you know what

---------22:35----------
voltage it's supposed to be or they'll

---------22:38----------
say well you get to compare with all the

---------22:39----------
board's around you so you know of course

---------22:41----------
you know involved it as opposed to me

---------22:42----------
but I can't do that

---------22:43----------
listen we have to think a little bit so

---------22:45----------
this is the chip that is creating but

---------22:48----------
pick the L right and this chip is

---------22:52----------
powered from its VDD pin and on the VDD

---------22:55----------
pin it receives PP 3 V 3 s 3 so I would

---------22:58----------
just guess that it needs pp 3 V 3 s 3 I

---------23:02----------
mean that that that signal is gonna be

---------23:04----------
3.3 volts since that's the voltage that

---------23:06----------
that chip is working with so yeah that

---------23:09----------
tells me something so I could see how

---------23:11----------
2.9 would be in that intermittent area

---------23:13----------
so it but as you see once it's in the

---------23:15----------
right area then it's more likely to

---------23:18----------
actually work the way it's supposed to

---------23:19----------
you never got to see it not working it's

---------23:22----------
 but that is the way doing

---------23:25----------
videos for the internet works as usual

---------23:27----------
nothing never goes as you plan it how

---------23:30----------
much you know what the only difference

---------23:32----------
before was I had the Wi-Fi plugged in so

---------23:33----------
let's see if that had an any difference

---------23:35----------
or anything to do with it which it

---------23:36----------
probably won't

---------23:37----------
it probably won't it probably has

---------23:40----------
nothing to do with this at all

---------23:45----------
yep still works I can't explain it I

---------23:49----------
have known I wish more of the stuff in

---------23:51----------
my pile would fix itself I mean I get

---------23:55----------
closer to going on that permanent

---------23:57----------
vacation until the next video thank you

---------24:00----------
for watching and I am as always I hope

---------24:03----------
you learned something and I hope this

---------24:04----------
mic sounds better let me know in the

---------24:06----------
comments what you think
