---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be going over a

---------00:01----------
motherboard for somebody who's actually

---------00:03----------
taking the class he brought it in it was

---------00:05----------
dead and I'm gonna go over what it is

---------00:07----------
that I did to fix it this is somebody

---------00:10----------
that I actually wound up firing about

---------00:12----------
three or four years ago and he opened

---------00:15----------
his own store since about three or four

---------00:16----------
blocks away and this is one of the

---------00:18----------
things that I want to talk about this

---------00:19----------
one of the things that I've brought up

---------00:21----------
before is you know should you see your

---------00:22----------
employees as competition should you see

---------00:23----------
your ex employees as competition should

---------00:25----------
you work really hard to not you know to

---------00:28----------
now let them advance or to let them

---------00:32----------
learn or to let them move on do the

---------00:34----------
wrong thing and you know he got fired he

---------00:40----------
got fired and he opened a store this is

---------00:42----------
the exact same thing that we do about

---------00:44----------
three blocks away and I don't care I

---------00:47----------
sell him parts I fix his boards he's

---------00:51----------
gonna be learning over the next five

---------00:52----------
days how to fix motherboards from me and

---------00:55----------
Jessa and me and that's what it is it's

---------00:59----------
like you know you people who are going

---------01:00----------
off the deep end about how

---------01:02----------
terrible it is that your employee

---------01:04----------
decided wait a second I don't want to

---------01:07----------
make $7 an hour anymore I want to work

---------01:09----------
for myself and make my own money how

---------01:12----------
dare you like go and all that

---------01:15----------
like you people who are going off the

---------01:17----------
deep end on that and how that's gonna

---------01:18----------
spell the end for your business

---------01:19----------
he opened a store like one or two years

---------01:21----------
ago I'm still here I'm still making

---------01:24----------
money

---------01:25----------
I still get dinner at Friday night at

---------01:27----------
Mazetti though I'm fine like I don't

---------01:29----------
care that somebody else is opened very

---------01:31----------
nearby and it kinda like it's that it's

---------01:33----------
that whole other that's stupid mentality

---------01:36----------
of like that person does the same thing

---------01:38----------
I do I'm going to hate them why is it

---------01:40----------
that the pizza really like why is it

---------01:41----------
that the owner of the pizzeria on this

---------01:43----------
block doesn't it doesn't hate the poner

---------01:45----------
of the pizzeria three blocks away why is

---------01:47----------
it that the Duane Reade person doesn't

---------01:49----------
hate the CBS person five blocks away but

---------01:51----------
why while the repair person on this

---------01:54----------
block has to hate the repair person

---------01:56----------
three blocks away or hate the repair

---------01:58----------
person eight blocks away or hate the

---------02:00----------
repair person ten miles away because

---------02:01----------
they're stealing my business again

---------02:04----------
business is just fine people are still

---------02:07----------
walking in I'm still fixing boards and

---------02:09----------
he's paying to take this class so I mean

---------02:11----------
really like that I'm making

---------02:13----------
money off of the relationship I'm

---------02:15----------
learning off of the relationship because

---------02:17----------
I got to fix something I've never fixed

---------02:19----------
that particular problem before I've

---------02:20----------
never fixed that particular combination

---------02:22----------
that I'm gonna be showing you so I did

---------02:24----------
learn something off of it you know you

---------02:25----------
just get out of this small-minded

---------02:27----------
simple-minded of this person

---------02:30----------
does what I do because they do the same

---------02:32----------
thing I do they are in direct

---------02:33----------
competition with me they're taking food

---------02:35----------
off my plate I must hate them I don't

---------02:36----------
care if you open upstairs for me I don't

---------02:39----------
care if you open next door to me I don't

---------02:40----------
care if you open over there I don't care

---------02:42----------
if you open in my basement I don't care

---------02:43----------
if you open in the street right in front

---------02:45----------
of my store I'll be just fine I don't

---------02:47----------
care really I have that level of

---------02:49----------
confidence that my skill set is worth

---------02:51----------
something that I know what I'm doing

---------02:53----------
that I provide a good service and then I

---------02:54----------
know enough about what I do that I can

---------02:57----------
transfer my knowledge base from here to

---------02:59----------
something else if this doesn't become

---------03:00----------
viable I am confident enough in that and

---------03:02----------
I'm sure enough of myself then I don't

---------03:04----------
care I'm not gonna I'm not splitting

---------03:06----------
hair isn't like throwing stones at

---------03:08----------
people because they opened up a few

---------03:09----------
blocks away am I going to help his

---------03:11----------
business for free no the glass

---------03:13----------
you're paying for that class the board

---------03:15----------
you're paying for that board repair but

---------03:17----------
am i again I mean I can have this

---------03:19----------
jealous silly mentality like he also

---------03:21----------
used to work for another repair shop in

---------03:22----------
the area and the owner actually came in

---------03:24----------
with it because he's across the street

---------03:25----------
from this place and it's like screaming

---------03:27----------
and screaming and bitching and like a

---------03:30----------
butt literally like trying to like rip

---------03:31----------
the counter out of it and just you know

---------03:34----------
that's the sign of an insecure

---------03:35----------
individual that's the sign of an

---------03:37----------
individual who's not really sure of

---------03:38----------
himself that's the sign of somebody who

---------03:40----------
who doesn't really feel like he has a

---------03:43----------
worth in what he does that feels like

---------03:45----------
maybe he got lucky

---------03:46----------
doing it and he's afraid that one day

---------03:48----------
that may go away rise again if you're

---------03:50----------
good at what you do and you're excellent

---------03:52----------
at what you do and you have a good

---------03:53----------
mindset you have a good attitude and

---------03:55----------
you're always open to learning new

---------03:56----------
things and you're always open to doing

---------03:58----------
new things you'll find it just doesn't

---------04:00----------
matter if you do the same thing as other

---------04:01----------
people so now that that little lecture

---------04:02----------
is over let's move on to the actual

---------04:04----------
border pair so today we're gonna go over

---------04:05----------
a retina that was not turning on I had a

---------04:08----------
few issues I couldn't I can't quite say

---------04:10----------
that I fully repaired it and when you

---------04:12----------
see what it looks like you'll understand

---------04:13----------
I'm gonna still be getting used to this

---------04:15----------
new microscope that I have here at least

---------04:18----------
until I get the whole thing with the

---------04:21----------
this

---------04:22----------
nothing here is stable I swear anyway

---------04:26----------
buddy I have to get used to the whole

---------04:28----------
it's all it's blurry on one side but

---------04:31----------
yeah this is pretty cool so I'm feature

---------04:33----------
videos are gonna be really really cool

---------04:35----------
once I get the whole microscope thing

---------04:36----------
situated because you're gay you're gonna

---------04:38----------
actually be able to see what I'm doing

---------04:41----------
but I'm gonna be able to see what I'm

---------04:42----------
doing too because usually I can only see

---------04:44----------
out of one eye and that sucks so we have

---------04:46----------
some going on here ISM I

---------04:47----------
haven't bothered cleaning any of this up

---------04:49----------
yet let me yeah you're right I gotta get

---------04:56----------
used to the new lever there we go all

---------05:02----------
right so adjustable zoom say see we have

---------05:10----------
that the Micra

---------05:24----------
that thing that's trying to give a

---------05:25----------
[ __ ] again see it's going down

---------05:31----------
down down stop but all microscope is

---------05:41----------
turning into BAM miley cyrus go okay

---------05:44----------
anyway so

---------05:54----------
we're doing oh you're doing it again

---------06:02----------
Amato makes some pretty kick-ass

---------06:04----------
microscopes they really do but this

---------06:06----------
stand like whoever came up with this

---------06:07----------
needs to be kicked in the balls

---------06:12----------
they need a girlfriend or something like

---------06:14----------
you can tell that they really need a

---------06:16----------
girlfriend er to get laid or to jerk off

---------06:19----------
because you're designing microscope

---------06:20----------
stands that just go right down on your

---------06:26----------
lap it's like is there something you

---------06:28----------
want to tell us about you want to speak

---------06:30----------
with the rest of the class like is it

---------06:32----------
something you'd like to tell the

---------06:33----------
therapist something missing in your life

---------06:35----------
maybe [ __ ] sake anyway see ya we have

---------06:39----------
a wire over there it's going to the

---------06:41----------
other other side of the board and it

---------06:44----------
don't look neat at all because it just

---------06:47----------
doesn't so you have you have it going

---------06:48----------
from there to there I'm gonna show it

---------06:53----------
that's four in a minute and then we also

---------06:55----------
if there's this that's not really

---------06:56----------
 this this is

---------07:00----------
so this like yeah this here is we're

---------07:08----------
gonna talk about what all that shit's

---------07:09----------
for and what was going on with it

---------07:12----------
and why I did the things that I did

---------07:15----------
because this is not real time I think

---------07:18----------
I've spoiled all of you with the real

---------07:19----------
time board repairs okay so what was

---------07:25----------
going on so on this board I was going

---------07:28----------
through my list of power rails I

---------07:33----------
am sick and tired of being sick and

---------07:36----------
tired okay where's the power rail list

---------07:39----------
so one of the things I always tell you

---------07:41----------
guys to do is go through the list of

---------07:42----------
power rails and

---------07:49----------
it's missing why would you keep it on

---------07:54----------
page three like it's not like power

---------07:56----------
rails of the first thing you should

---------07:57----------
check it's not like you should put the

---------07:58----------
first thing you should check on the

---------07:59----------
first page No

---------08:00----------
Apple Apple has to put it on like page

---------08:03----------
or what is it on here 65 okay the thing

---------08:07----------
that I tell you is the most important

---------08:08----------
thing the thing that you're supposed to

---------08:09----------
check first is on page 65 the

---------08:13----------
schematic idiots you write this

---------08:15----------
documentation ja anyway but you know

---------08:18----------
that like technical writing that's

---------08:20----------
actually a job like this is not like the

---------08:21----------
engineer is going okay I'm designing the

---------08:24----------
board okay I want the SPI ROM chip to go

---------08:26----------
here okay let me just draw that no this

---------08:28----------
is somebody's job to do this they get

---------08:30----------
paid good money to do nothing but write

---------08:31----------
documentation and that dumb ass decides

---------08:34----------
to put it

---------08:35----------
I like the molle and the most important

---------08:37----------
thing on page 65 she's dumb just dumb

---------08:42----------
anyway I checked P P budge t3 hot it's

---------08:45----------
there I check avi I don't even bother

---------08:48----------
checking DC n bored because if I have

---------08:50----------
any power on the board obviously the

---------08:52----------
charger is getting to it

---------08:53----------
I check PP 3 before - it's there I

---------08:55----------
checked PPV RTC g3 hot it's there but

---------08:59----------
it's missing someplace but we're gonna

---------09:00----------
get to that in a second

---------09:01----------
I check PP 5vs5 it's there I check PP 5

---------09:04----------
es 4 it's not so my head I go thing we

---------09:07----------
don't have an S 4 power state I check PP

---------09:10----------
5 es so obviously it's not there because

---------09:12----------
you need PP 5 vs 4 before you get to PP

---------09:14----------
5 vs o so what these are over here these

---------09:17----------
are different power states from the

---------09:18----------
machine as 5 it's off s 4 it's

---------09:22----------
hibernating s 3 you're in suspense so

---------09:25----------
hibernate is when you save all the

---------09:27----------
contents of your computer to your drive

---------09:28----------
all the stuff that's in memory gets

---------09:30----------
saved to the drive then when you turn it

---------09:31----------
back on it just restores all that

---------09:33----------
information from me from the drive it's

---------09:35----------
slower than s 3 s 3 is where you suspend

---------09:38----------
you save everything in memory so usually

---------09:40----------
when you close your computer you're

---------09:42----------
putting it to just asleep that's suspend

---------09:45----------
that's an s3 state as oh is when you're

---------09:47----------
on and the computer is open and you're

---------09:48----------
actively using it so if you don't have

---------09:51----------
the rails necessary for s 4 you're

---------09:52----------
obviously not going to get anything at s

---------09:54----------
o

---------09:56----------
it's like you know it's like asking a

---------09:57----------
baby to run before the baby has walked

---------09:59----------
so then I check PP 3 V 3 s 5 and it's

---------10:04----------
there I check PP 3 V 3 S 4 and it's not

---------10:07----------
there and then this kind of starts to

---------10:10----------
click in my head okay all the S 4 power

---------10:11----------
rails are not I'm not clicking in so I

---------10:13----------
go or you know let's go and see what's

---------10:16----------
responsible for this

---------10:25----------
Adobe's on top today Wow your acted

---------10:28----------
actually you're actually acting like a

---------10:30----------
six core processor with 16 gigs of ram

---------10:32----------
and SSDs and raid zero

---------10:34----------
look at that it's like instant this is

---------10:36----------
never gonna happen again so appreciate

---------10:38----------
this I'm hitting enter in the PDF reader

---------10:40----------
and it's just bam bam bam bam this yeah

---------10:43----------
this this really doesn't ever happen

---------10:49----------
okay pp 3 b3 s4 comes from let's see

---------10:57----------
where does it come from so that comes

---------11:09----------
from pp 3 b3 rs5 so this here is a

---------11:13----------
switch that's gonna take P P 3 B 3 s 5

---------11:15----------
on input V n voltage in how to use your

---------11:18----------
brain again it's not all spelled out for

---------11:20----------
you but use your brain and it's gonna

---------11:22----------
turn it into V o V out which is pp 3 V 3

---------11:28----------
that's 4 based on s 4 underscore PWR

---------11:31----------
underscore and naval so on so voltage in

---------11:35----------
voltage out and do I turn on ya you

---------11:37----------
don't have to look up that chip you

---------11:38----------
don't have to get a pin out to

---------11:39----------
understand what it does it's got to use

---------11:42----------
your brain but if you can't use your

---------11:44----------
brain you can always Google TPS 2 to 9

---------11:47----------
to 0 and you might find information on

---------11:49----------
it so s4 power enable booth well is

---------12:01----------
created by this chip this chip is know

---------12:04----------
stuff ok next no stuff me that's

---------12:15----------
on the board which means that ultimately

---------12:17----------
I was getting trolled by looking at out

---------12:18----------
to begin with so so if the chip so if

---------12:21----------
the chip that's creates that signal

---------12:23----------
doesn't exist I'm not gonna figure that

---------12:25----------
out right now let's so I just go okay

---------12:28----------
let's try PP 5vs for their yard a little

---------12:33----------
bit because I was tired from spending my

---------12:35----------
whole day coughing look this is a chip

---------12:40----------
responsible for PP 5 vs 4 + PP 3 V 3 S 5

---------12:45----------
and P P 3 V 3 s 5 becomes PP 3 B 3 S 4

---------12:49----------
so you have to enables on this chip

---------12:52----------
right you have s 5 power enable and my

---------12:55----------
pp 3 B 3 S 5 was there then you have P 5

---------12:59----------
vs for RS 3 en that's one confusing

---------13:03----------
 acronym but if you look up what

---------13:05----------
this chip does this side enable enables

---------13:10----------
this rail and this side enable enables

---------13:12----------
this rail so before I go about

---------13:14----------
troubleshooting this whole circuit

---------13:16----------
because this is a lot of stuff going on

---------13:18----------
over here and again I can make it really

---------13:19----------
simple for you if I have a few minutes

---------13:21----------
but I don't even want to bother with

---------13:22----------
that right now I just want to know

---------13:23----------
should I even be troubleshooting this

---------13:24----------
let's see if the enable signal is there

---------13:26----------
again before you go measuring all these

---------13:28----------
resistors before you start going down a

---------13:29----------
rabbit hole ask yourself am I going down

---------13:31----------
the right rabbit hole so why am I gonna

---------13:34----------
Matt why am I gonna with all of

---------13:36----------
this we didn't see if this resistor is 1

---------13:38----------
ohm and this resistor and then you know

---------13:40----------
like and this inductor is good and this

---------13:43----------
capacitor is good and this resistor is

---------13:45----------
why bother before seeing if the chip is

---------13:47----------
even being told to turn on so I check my

---------13:50----------
to try to get this out without coughing

---------13:52----------
p5 vs 4 RS 3 en and it's zero so I

---------14:00----------
wonder where does that come from because

---------14:01----------
that signal is what's going to be

---------14:03----------
telling what this chip to turn on that

---------14:04----------
power out what what is where is that

---------14:07----------
coming from so I searched through my PDF

---------14:12----------
and I see oh it's coming from here now

---------14:14----------
this is going through these resistors

---------14:17----------
and this diode that's not actually there

---------14:20----------
but they just put it there to with

---------14:21----------
me and this resistor it's coming from PM

---------14:25----------
sleep s4l so p5 vs 4 r

---------14:28----------
three underscore enable is coming from

---------14:31----------
p.m. underscore sleep underscore s four

---------14:33----------
underscore L so I measure p.m. sleep s4l

---------14:36----------
and it's zero so let's oh I'm tired of

---------14:41----------
the coughing so BM sleep as for L Cubs

---------14:45----------
fro my CP you remember what I said about

---------14:49----------
how on has well and above the PCH and

---------14:52----------
many platforms is actually integrated

---------14:54----------
into the CPU so the PCH or the mCP as

---------14:58----------
they used to call it used to control all

---------14:59----------
these functions in the machine like

---------15:02----------
powering on so they used to have the CPU

---------15:04----------
and then MCP or CPU and a PCH now to

---------15:09----------
make life easier and simpler they have

---------15:10----------
the CPU they have the PCH inside the CPU

---------15:13----------
which is why the CPU looks a little bit

---------15:15----------
bigger on as well

---------15:17----------
platforms and you can that's supposed to

---------15:20----------
come from here so my PC H must be bad

---------15:23----------
right because it's not creating that

---------15:25----------
signal I should just walk over to my BG

---------15:27----------
a machine and be a monkey and replace

---------15:29----------
the chip because the chip must be bad

---------15:30----------
right no use your brain that's one of

---------15:33----------
the things that I'm always telling you

---------15:34----------
here and that's one of the things that

---------15:36----------
just killed me a BGA culture because

---------15:38----------
again they got these forums that are

---------15:39----------
that are for nothing other than BGA chip

---------15:42----------
replacement they do nothing but you know

---------15:44----------
talk about how to replace BGA chips

---------15:46----------
nothing lay and all they know how to do

---------15:49----------
is replace

---------15:51----------
BGA chips the monkey can take the chip

---------15:53----------
off the board the monkey can reball the

---------15:56----------
chip the monkey can put the chip back on

---------15:58----------
the board but the monk you can't think

---------15:59----------
the monkey can't use his brain and

---------16:01----------
that's what I'm trying to get you to do

---------16:02----------
I want you to use your brain and I want

---------16:05----------
you to understand what's going on don't

---------16:07----------
replace things before you think so what

---------16:10----------
else could cause that thing to not be

---------16:13----------
creating what it needs well let's go

---------16:15----------
back to our schematic not the microscope

---------16:19----------
I said let's go back to our schematic so

---------16:22----------
we go over here

---------16:38----------
so how does this work so on the left

---------16:42----------
side for system power management we have

---------16:45----------
a bunch of inputs so power pit / okay /

---------16:49----------
okay Rissa marisa

---------16:52----------
Batlow all this stuff so we have a bunch

---------16:54----------
of inputs over here and then a bunch of

---------16:56----------
outputs over here without getting into

---------16:59----------
reading the documentation on how this

---------17:01----------
chip works without getting into any of

---------17:03----------
this a bunch of inputs on the left a

---------17:06----------
bunch of outputs on the right maybe you

---------17:08----------
need the inputs on the left to get the

---------17:10----------
outputs on the right right so I'm going

---------17:14----------
through all of these and I want to see

---------17:16----------
if anything looks particularly funny and

---------17:18----------
what I've wind up looking at is p.m.

---------17:20----------
underscore PCH underscore / okay p.m.

---------17:25----------
underscore PCH okay right PCH power okay

---------17:35----------
my PCH is what creates the sleep signal

---------17:39----------
and as my PCH power okay so I look in my

---------17:42----------
you 1950 area when you look in the you

---------17:45----------
1950 area instead of seeing a nice

---------17:49----------
healthy nice-looking chip you see

---------17:52----------
something that looks kind of like this

---------17:54----------
at least now that's what you see because

---------17:57----------
that's after I've I've kind of sodomized

---------18:00----------
it but but as you can see there's a pin

---------18:12----------
that's missing right over here that that

---------18:16----------
pad is gone this component that was over

---------18:18----------
there look like and if we go back

---------18:20----------
to the board view you'll see that right

---------18:23----------
all aware that's supposed to be let's

---------18:24----------
see what that pad is for that is

---------18:29----------
pin 8 which is pp 3v4 to underscore g3

---------18:32----------
ah so let's go back to the schematic

---------18:34----------
zoom in on this and let's start thinking

---------18:36----------
what is this what does this do well if

---------18:41----------
you google it you'll find out that it's

---------18:42----------
a logic gate but if you don't want to

---------18:44----------
google it you just want to use a little

---------18:45----------
bit of the brain you'll see that you

---------18:47----------
have a power line over here then you

---------18:50----------
have separate inputs and then you have

---------18:56----------
the output so the way this works is very

---------18:59----------
simple if you have peep you have this

---------19:02----------
input all says power good then it's

---------19:06----------
going to take PP 3 before to underscore

---------19:08----------
g3 hot and pass that through or it's

---------19:11----------
gonna become PCH sis power ok which is

---------19:14----------
what we want but unfortunately we don't

---------19:16----------
have pp 3 V 4 200 squared G 3 hot on

---------19:18----------
this chip because the pad itself is

---------19:20----------
actually burned and missing so what I

---------19:23----------
want to do is I want to go over to my

---------19:25----------
donor board and I want to get myself one

---------19:27----------
of those chips right remember what I

---------19:32----------
said about this business remember what I

---------19:34----------
said about how you're constantly a

---------19:35----------
dumpster diver and okay just to give you

---------19:39----------
an idea this is the board this is what

---------19:41----------
it's supposed to look like

---------19:42----------
it's what my donor board looks like do

---------19:44----------
you think I have the chip that I need no

---------19:46----------
I don't so off man Louis needs to

---------19:59----------
get health care you know this is this is

---------20:03----------
one of the things about that like I was

---------20:04----------
talking about how health care is

---------20:05----------
 in the other video this coffee

---------20:08----------
may be annoying and it may be on like

---------20:10----------
week number two but the twenty five

---------20:13----------
thirty thousand bucks that I've probably

---------20:15----------
saved by not paying money into a system

---------20:17----------
that's designed to not give me that

---------20:18----------
money back I'll forget about these two

---------20:21----------
weeks I won't forget about twenty or

---------20:23----------
thirty thousand dollars because somebody

---------20:26----------
commented on that before it's I'll be

---------20:29----------
fine let's go back here

---------20:35----------
so what I did is I just took PP 3 V 4

---------20:38----------
200 squared G 3 hot and jumpered it over

---------20:42----------
to pin 3 over here so I don't care if

---------20:44----------
all says power goat or CPU VRP good or

---------20:47----------
there or any of these P codes are there

---------20:49----------
who cares

---------20:50----------
let's look see it even says over here

---------20:52----------
like do we need this do we need this nah

---------20:56----------
I don't think we need this they're

---------20:59----------
saying do we need this about something

---------21:01----------
else that's probably really really in

---------21:02----------
see like the Apple engineer thinks the

---------21:05----------
same way I do really like yeah like do

---------21:08----------
it like it really is it's kind of funny

---------21:10----------
reading this sometimes like do we need

---------21:12----------
this no and then I noticed after I did

---------21:16----------
that that it still didn't work so what

---------21:19----------
else does a computer need to run what

---------21:22----------
else is needed

---------21:23----------
hmm let's take a look in the schematic

---------21:25----------
and go through and try to think a little

---------21:28----------
bit about what else that you would need

---------21:30----------
for a computer to work but before I do

---------21:34----------
that let me reopen the PDF reader

---------21:35----------
because Adobe decided to go to

---------22:02----------
ah okay you don't get the block diagram

---------22:04----------
anymore

---------22:05----------
wow they used to have a bunch of little

---------22:07----------
cool-looking illustrations with arrows

---------22:09----------
going between them showing how

---------22:11----------
everything worked and that's just gone

---------22:15----------
they don't care

---------22:25----------
tell me that that little diagram is gone

---------22:28----------
because that was really helpful for

---------22:30----------
learning okay it's gone all right one of

---------22:47----------
the things that you need to know about

---------22:48----------
computers and I understand I'm good I

---------22:50----------
really understand if you don't know this

---------22:51----------
from the beginning and it's not

---------22:52----------
something you really can be expected to

---------22:54----------
know computers need a clock that's what

---------22:57----------
it is when I'm hitting this an open bra

---------22:58----------
when I'm hitting the shortcuts for open

---------22:59----------
broadcaster it's actually up the

---------23:01----------
PDF reader focus on that later computers

---------23:04----------
need a clock in order to work so you may

---------23:06----------
have heard about clock cycle or clock

---------23:08----------
rate or how fast the processor can work

---------23:09----------
but when something is communicating with

---------23:12----------
something else that's also done based on

---------23:14----------
a clock so if you have different pieces

---------23:16----------
of a computer that are talking to one

---------23:17----------
another

---------23:17----------
you need a clock so if you have a PCH

---------23:21----------
that's talking to other elements of the

---------23:23----------
machine or a PCH to talk slow BIOS chip

---------23:25----------
or PCH that's creating signals that

---------23:27----------
needs to be done on some type of a clock

---------23:28----------
and one of the clock signals that's

---------23:30----------
really important is the RTC clock so

---------23:33----------
let's see if my PDF reader will allow me

---------23:34----------
to zoom in again huh it is that's very

---------23:37----------
gracious of it thank you oh you decided

---------23:40----------
not to it is a here we go okay so every

---------23:44----------
I had control on a number it [ __ ] that

---------23:45----------
up I gotta look up why this doing that

---------23:47----------
later

---------23:47----------
PCH underscore clock 32 okay underscore

---------23:51----------
RTC X 1 BC 8 what the that's not what I

---------23:55----------
hit I had control F PCH underscore clock

---------23:59----------
32k underscore TC x1 and that's created

---------24:05----------
by you SiC 1900 so when I look in this

---------24:10----------
area

---------24:10----------
I have PPV RTC underscore g3 hot that's

---------24:14----------
a power L now there was actually present

---------24:16----------
on my machine it was present when I

---------24:18----------
measured the probe point up here it

---------24:22----------
wasn't present it wasn't present when I

---------24:30----------
measured right by over here and that

---------24:38----------
capacitor almost didn't exist and that

---------24:42----------
made me very very sad so I replace the

---------24:46----------
capacitor I replace the chip I'm not a

---------24:54----------
smoker either so lame and this is what I

---------24:58----------
get I should show you what the RTC clock

---------25:01----------
actually looks like it's something good

---------25:07----------
turn to no one yeah you measure it with

---------25:09----------
an oscilloscope you can use a frequency

---------25:12----------
counter a frequent but I have called me

---------25:15----------
nuts I when I'm I want to see things I

---------25:17----------
like being able to see things and keep

---------25:20----------
in mind like when I started this I

---------25:22----------
didn't have an education and how to

---------25:24----------
repair motherboards I was learning as I

---------25:26----------
went so I figured that if I can actually

---------25:27----------
see what was going on that it would help

---------25:29----------
me because I'm a bit of a visual learner

---------25:30----------
so you could explain to me how a buck

---------25:33----------
converter works into you're blue in the

---------25:34----------
face but when you explain you show me oh

---------25:36----------
it's a bunch of spikes and then zero and

---------25:39----------
then 12 and 0 and 12 and 0 like that and

---------25:41----------
then that that's that in it's switching

---------25:43----------
and then that gets turned on the other

---------25:45----------
side into a clean voltage when it's

---------25:47----------
averaged out it makes sense

---------25:48----------
even though it's a very very simple

---------25:50----------
concept you can explain it to me in the

---------25:51----------
classroom 50 times but when I see it

---------25:53----------
it's easy so people ask that was a

---------25:56----------
comment somebody made the other day

---------25:57----------
should I buy a

---------25:58----------
frequency counter should I buy an

---------25:59----------
oscilloscope if you're learning

---------26:01----------
I would I would just recommend they try

---------26:03----------
to find yourself a used Regal or I goal

---------26:06----------
however you're supposed to pronounce it

---------26:07----------
oscilloscope because it really does

---------26:09----------
assist in the learning process if you're

---------26:12----------
starting out it's it's cool to be able

---------26:14----------
to see things I mean it costs money but

---------26:16----------
the money that you can make the money

---------26:18----------
that you can get from people if you know

---------26:20----------
how to do this right is so ridiculously

---------26:23----------
high that it really does offset the cost

---------26:24----------
of tools like this that are gonna help

---------26:26----------
you learn so the cameras at the facial

---------26:28----------
focus so I've wanted to focus on the

---------26:30----------
oscilloscope I got to put my face near

---------26:32----------
the oscilloscope I don't feel like

---------26:34----------
getting off to adjust the focus right

---------26:35----------
now because I've been coughing my brain

---------26:38----------
out all day where is our TC which one of

---------26:43----------
these probes is our TC there we go

---------26:45----------
are you our TC

---------26:49----------
that's a clock signal that is not our

---------26:55----------
tea

---------26:56----------
it's one point one killer it's

---------27:02----------
okay which pro point was it you know you

---------27:05----------
know No

---------27:10----------
not even close why don't I just bring

---------27:14----------
the schematic and stop being a dumbass

---------27:17----------
it's true like men really can't ask for

---------27:19----------
directions like I could all I have to do

---------27:21----------
is put these two Pro points down and

---------27:23----------
move over to the board view and

---------27:28----------
I could easily find out where RTC is

---------27:30----------
after just a quick copy and paste

---------27:34----------
No I gotta be a man I gotta figure out

---------27:37----------
better so dumb man are so stupid

---------27:44----------
this really is the motherboard repair

---------27:47----------
version of just not stopping on the side

---------27:49----------
of the road to ask for directions okay

---------27:51----------
fine I give up I cave where the hell is

---------27:57----------
our TC somewhere over here of course I

---------28:04----------
find it right away when I click on there

---------28:05----------
I don't find that that's what kills me I

---------28:07----------
don't find it right away when I'm

---------28:09----------
actually looking forward and I've been

---------28:12----------
measured but I knew I knew that was

---------28:13----------
gonna happen I knew that soon as I the

---------28:14----------
first thing I clicked on that

---------28:15----------
board we was gonna be it okay so this is

---------28:20----------
what our TC looks like that is a bunch

---------28:23----------
of distorted right so let's

---------28:27----------
just that's a clock signal but focus on

---------28:35----------
the face focus on my face in front of

---------28:37----------
the oscilloscope see all right good

---------28:41----------
camera oh I see that is our TC and my

---------28:47----------
oscilloscope actually I set it to

---------28:49----------
measure frequency so it says 32 point 68

---------28:51----------
which is what I want but before when I

---------28:54----------
measured there I had nothing which was

---------28:55----------
my hint that something was up and

---------28:58----------
then after I measured and saw that I had

---------29:00----------
no clock signal I looked in the clock

---------29:01----------
area and I saw it looked like a corroded

---------29:03----------
pile of and then you know we just

---------29:06----------
go from there and as always I want to

---------29:10----------
show you that this thing actually works

---------29:11----------
but I'm not gonna be able to show you

---------29:13----------
that it fully works because it also

---------29:15----------
needs a bios chip programming I'm not

---------29:18----------
sure if it needs the chip replaced and

---------29:20----------
Pro and reprogrammed or if it needs of

---------29:21----------
this the or if it just needs to be

---------29:24----------
reprogrammed since this was originally

---------29:26----------
liquid damaging corroded I'm most likely

---------29:28----------
just going to replace it with a new chip

---------29:30----------
so one of the things that you got to

---------29:32----------
think about by the way that I've never

---------29:33----------
mentioned in these other videos when

---------29:34----------
you're dealing with Core 2 Duo platforms

---------29:36----------
replace the bios chip to your heart's

---------29:38----------
content

---------29:38----------
don't give a or worry about

---------29:39----------
anything when you're replacing the BIOS

---------29:41----------
chip on an i5 or an i7 or a core

---------29:45----------
platform one of the things that you have

---------29:47----------
to worry about is something called the

---------29:49----------
Intel management engine so that's the

---------29:51----------
part that we're you know the BIOS chip

---------29:54----------
or the efi rom the spi rom whatever you

---------29:57----------
want to call it is going

---------29:58----------
be talking to the PCH which in older

---------30:01----------
platforms is discrete and this platform

---------30:03----------
is integrated into the CPU and it talks

---------30:06----------
about a lot of stuff that's important it

---------30:08----------
talks about things like you know okay am

---------30:11----------
I gonna let the Wi-Fi card actually

---------30:13----------
working connect to network supposed to

---------30:15----------
just see networks and not do anything it

---------30:17----------
talks about stuff like should I let the

---------30:19----------
graphics chip run at a usable speed or

---------30:22----------
should I freeze viewing a 240p YouTube

---------30:24----------
video and you're gonna find that a lot

---------30:26----------
of people who are complaining about

---------30:28----------
their system running slow after doing

---------30:29----------
something like they a lot of people

---------30:31----------
gonna say oh well I had my computer

---------30:33----------
fixed but now it runs really slower I

---------30:35----------
fixed my own machine this is this is a

---------30:37----------
good one because I like I like talking

---------30:39----------
about things that are practical they go

---------30:41----------
you know now it runs really slow like it

---------30:43----------
works but when I go to watch a youtube

---------30:44----------
video it freezes and I'll just look at

---------30:47----------
them and I say okay so so you bought it

---------30:49----------
stolen right like no like okay so the

---------30:53----------
person you got it from what it's stolen

---------30:54----------
no okay so you're the one who stole it

---------30:56----------
because here's what it is these

---------30:58----------
[ __ ] on eBay what they do is they

---------31:00----------
take BIOS chips off of dead boards and

---------31:01----------
they sell them for efi unlocked because

---------31:04----------
the password isn't isn't the the SPI

---------31:06----------
Romney the BIOS chip and what they do

---------31:09----------
because they're ignorant [ __ ] that

---------31:11----------
are more concerned making forty five

---------31:12----------
dollars helping you work with the stolen

---------31:15----------
laptop than actually fixing technology

---------31:16----------
is they don't reprogram the Intel

---------31:18----------
management engine you need to have a

---------31:19----------
clean Intel management engine portion of

---------31:21----------
the SPI ROM or else this is not going to

---------31:24----------
work and the only reason that 99% of the

---------31:27----------
time that your average person is

---------31:29----------
touching that chip because let me tell

---------31:31----------
you something they're not touching that

---------31:32----------
chip because they're having problems

---------31:33----------
with the PM sleep s4l signal they're

---------31:35----------
touching it because they want the bios

---------31:36----------
unlocked so that they can use their

---------31:38----------
stolen laptop and the thing is they

---------31:41----------
don't know anything about the the

---------31:42----------
management engine region so what they do

---------31:44----------
is they buy that stupid chip off of ebay

---------31:47----------
from some dumbass who advertises that I

---------31:49----------
could fix BIOS unlocks and the BIOS

---------31:52----------
password gets unlocked but then it runs

---------31:53----------
really unbearably slow and it's

---------31:55----------
not a usable computer so what you need

---------31:58----------
to do is you need to reprogram it with a

---------31:59----------
clean dump and you need to rebuild the

---------32:01----------
Intel management engine there's a lot of

---------32:03----------
documentation on how to do that and it

---------32:05----------
all sucks it really does like there are

---------32:07----------
a lot of forums where they say we've

---------32:09----------
told you how to do this all you got to

---------32:11----------
do is read

---------32:12----------
it's right there and unlike unlike my

---------32:15----------
content where I'm literally

---------32:16----------
spoon feeding it to you that stuff it is

---------32:19----------
oh my god it is bad they like they miss

---------32:24----------
out on so much I mean really like

---------32:26----------
that if you find a forum that is good at

---------32:29----------
explaining to you our BIOS programming

---------32:31----------
works by all means like link it because

---------32:35----------
a lot of people are gonna need it it's

---------32:36----------
gonna help a lot of people and be nice

---------32:38----------
to them and donate to them and you know

---------32:40----------
really because when you get this stuff

---------32:42----------
there is no documentation for so many of

---------32:45----------
these programmers I mean it's you like

---------32:47----------
the programmer itself is so bad there's

---------32:52----------
no trackpad in this computer and look

---------32:54----------
what I can't wait that's that's that's

---------32:57----------
stupid anyway it's it's it's so bad this

---------33:02----------
that like you don't even know which way

---------33:05----------
to put the BIOS chip in like I remember

---------33:06----------
my friend got himself his own BIOS

---------33:08----------
program and he asked me your BIOS should

---------33:09----------
have been then he asked you have like 20

---------33:11----------
of these and what do you need 20 of them

---------33:12----------
for it's like I don't know how they

---------33:13----------
oriented in here and I keep sending 3

---------33:15----------
volts or something to the wrong part and

---------33:16----------
killing it it's really because the

---------33:18----------
documentation out there really really

---------33:20----------
really sucks and one of these days I'm

---------33:24----------
gonna get around to making a tutorial on

---------33:25----------
how to reprogram and how to deal with

---------33:27----------
Intel management engine of issues but I

---------33:29----------
just have too much stuff to do because

---------33:31----------
there's enough on my plate so I've just

---------33:34----------
been doing these these videos as is but

---------33:38----------
as you can see it boots you can see that

---------33:40----------
it's got that little little gingerbread

---------33:43----------
man thingy over there so which means

---------33:45----------
that I have I hate to call this fixed

---------33:49----------
this is more fixed than a reball GPU but

---------33:51----------
it's not fixed to my standard because I

---------33:53----------
have a jerry-rigged on there

---------33:55----------
but you can see that what I did actually

---------33:56----------
works and again as I always say if the

---------33:59----------
day that the work that I do stops

---------34:01----------
working stop watching my channel like I

---------34:04----------
own you know you want to be listening to

---------34:06----------
people who are doing work that actually

---------34:08----------
works you want to be listening to people

---------34:09----------
who are telling you to do something when

---------34:11----------
they are actually successful doing the

---------34:12----------
exact same thing that they're trying to

---------34:15----------
instruct you on how to do if your list

---------34:17----------
if somebody's telling you you here's how

---------34:19----------
you do X but they're not showing you

---------34:21----------
that they have run a successful business

---------34:22----------
doing X so that they have not

---------34:24----------
excellent 6x 2 ax ignore them if they've

---------34:27----------
had excellent success doing a be

---------34:28----------
everything from A to W but they haven't

---------34:31----------
had success doing X and they're trying

---------34:33----------
to tell you how to do X ignore them

---------34:35----------
really that's just one of my policies

---------34:37----------
and I want you and you should follow it

---------34:40----------
so let me just to go back over the

---------34:43----------
jerry-rigging portion because I want you

---------34:45----------
to know what I did so that you can um

---------34:48----------
not well do better over here I don't

---------34:52----------
have this chip I don't have you 1950 you

---------34:57----------
1950 is important because it's a logic

---------35:02----------
gate that's not going to let the PCH

---------35:04----------
turn on and do the things it needs to do

---------35:06----------
and send the signals it needs to send

---------35:07----------
unless these all system power good

---------35:10----------
signals are present and what I did is I

---------35:12----------
simply attached the power line for the

---------35:15----------
logic gate to the output of the logic

---------35:17----------
gate could totally bypassing it because

---------35:19----------
I don't have one of those because these

---------35:22----------
boards yeah like this this is what I'm

---------35:26----------
getting this is what I work with this is

---------35:29----------
how I professionally fix boards and our

---------35:31----------
lovely tech friendly marketplace this

---------35:35----------
and I've and I do a pretty damn good job

---------35:37----------
of it like you know you can google my

---------35:39----------
business I get a lot of these in and I

---------35:41----------
get a lot of these out and we handle a

---------35:44----------
good amount of volume and we kick ass

---------35:45----------
but like well not when people are asking

---------35:48----------
what is this right to repairable why is

---------35:49----------
it important this so when I need to

---------35:53----------
replace the SMC on that so you see this

---------35:54----------
