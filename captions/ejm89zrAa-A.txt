---------00:00----------
so before we get started today first

---------00:02----------
thing I wanted to do is say thank you

---------00:03----------
very much to the person that sent me

---------00:05----------
this mat and I love a new mat from my

---------00:07----------
desk I unfortunately forget the person's

---------00:09----------
name and the little piece of paper that

---------00:10----------
came with it is long gone and the mess

---------00:13----------
that is this store but I just wanted to

---------00:15----------
make sure that you knew that I got it

---------00:16----------
and say thank you so ok the news so a

---------00:19----------
few pieces of news here the first piece

---------00:21----------
of news is that I have a permit here I

---------00:24----------
know that permit an application for a

---------00:25----------
permit so that I can do a live stream

---------00:27----------
outside of the Apple Store I'd like to

---------00:30----------
do a live stream outside of the Apple

---------00:32----------
store where we go over customer devices

---------00:34----------
and see what they told the customer

---------00:36----------
versus with actually going on with the

---------00:38----------
device we'll open them I'll have my

---------00:39----------
microscope camera there

---------00:40----------
I'll have this camera there will up hi

---------00:42----------
hi there we may even have a booth babe

---------00:45----------
where a sign something that says oh by

---------00:47----------
the way we got this what is this these

---------00:50----------
up right please help yeah so we are

---------00:54----------
gonna so with the idea is that I want to

---------00:57----------
have somebody wearing a sign something

---------00:59----------
that says something like you know told

---------01:01----------
your data was gone get a second opinion

---------01:02----------
or you know quoted $800 or quoted a

---------01:06----------
thousand dollars second opinion with an

---------01:08----------
arrow and I was thinking of having a

---------01:10----------
booth babe or a brand ambassador there

---------01:13----------
that where's the sign somebody that you

---------01:16----------
know may look in a manner where people

---------01:18----------
may be inclined to read what's on the on

---------01:20----------
the sign even if they're not exactly

---------01:22----------
interested is that they walk over and

---------01:24----------
this is starting this is beginning so

---------01:26----------
this here is my application

---------01:27----------
I don't again I don't have a permit yet

---------01:29----------
but I am working on it just wanted to

---------01:31----------
let you all know that and we also have a

---------01:33----------
you're not yeah you need a permit for a

---------01:35----------
generator but I don't need a generator

---------01:37----------
I'm looking at an inverter so I'd like

---------01:39----------
to actually power the entire station off

---------01:41----------
of my bike battery so my bike battery

---------01:43----------
can put out lots of power sometimes more

---------01:45----------
than that peak it my bat my bike can put

---------01:47----------
out I'm gonna get myself a 48 volt to

---------01:49----------
120 volt inverter that I put under the

---------01:52----------
camera box so that I can power my laptop

---------01:54----------
the camcorder yeah so I'll be able to

---------01:57----------
power my quick my hot my soldering

---------01:59----------
station and my power supply and also the

---------02:02----------
microscope camera so we're gonna bring

---------02:04----------
all of that there so that we can film

---------02:05----------
and I should be able to power it off of

---------02:07----------
my bike battery I actually have two of

---------02:09----------
those bike batteries so if one of them

---------02:10----------
dies I love a backup and when one of

---------02:11----------
them

---------02:12----------
I'm gonna have somebody check it over to

---------02:13----------
the store to charge it and then bring it

---------02:15----------
back so this is this is gonna be fun but

---------02:17----------
this is this is going down and I am

---------02:20----------
incredibly excited see this

---------02:23----------
dad MacBook so let's get started open it

---------02:26----------
up and see what's going on with this

---------02:27----------
MacBook and see if we can make it work

---------02:28----------
again

---------02:38----------
all right so let's see what's going on

---------02:40----------
here so I just need to turn on my power

---------02:43----------
supply software so the first thing that

---------02:45----------
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plug it into a

---------02:47----------
power supply that I have here so I'm not

---------02:50----------
using a standard MagSafe this is a

---------02:53----------
circuit specialist CSI 3005 there should

---------02:56----------
be a link in the description below you

---------02:58----------
could buy it on their website and I'm

---------03:00----------
going to power that on and your first

---------03:02----------
thing I want to do is I want to see how

---------03:04----------
much power the board is taking itself

---------03:05----------
and that's why I try to plug it into a

---------03:06----------
power supply rather than something else

---------03:08----------
now as you could see here it's taking

---------03:10----------
200 milliamps and 200 milliamps actually

---------03:12----------
does tell me something so typically if

---------03:13----------
it's taking 20 to 30 milliamps I'm

---------03:16----------
missing p.m. sleeve s4l it's not going

---------03:18----------
to an s4 and s3 state if it's taking 500

---------03:20----------
milliamps it's turning on now the reason

---------03:22----------
that I'm interested in the amount of

---------03:23----------
power that the board is drawing the

---------03:25----------
amount of amperage is drawing is because

---------03:26----------
different amperage draws mean different

---------03:28----------
things and so what this does is the

---------03:29----------
moment I plug it in before I've done

---------03:31----------
anything I can get an idea of what is

---------03:33----------
wrong with the board in my head so every

---------03:35----------
time I solve a board let's say it takes

---------03:36----------
me 20 or 30 or 50 minutes to fix the

---------03:38----------
board once I know what the problem was

---------03:41----------
once I locate it then I tie that in my

---------03:43----------
head in a little spreadsheet that exists

---------03:45----------
in my mind to the problem that I hide

---------03:47----------
the problem that there was the amount of

---------03:49----------
amperage II was drawing at the beginning

---------03:50----------
and it's like pattern detection it

---------03:52----------
doesn't mean that I know exactly what's

---------03:54----------
wrong every time but it gives me an idea

---------03:55----------
where to look so 200 milliamps is gonna

---------03:57----------
mean either a PV bus g3 Honda being

---------03:59----------
created but short as a ground or B all

---------04:01----------
says power good is missing so let's see

---------04:02----------
what's true in this case now this that

---------04:04----------
we have over here is starting to become

---------04:06----------
a relic this is an 8 - 0 - 34:37 board

---------04:09----------
this is getting old this is a Haswell

---------04:12----------
based machine I was 5 years into my

---------04:15----------
business when Apple started using

---------04:16----------
Haswell boards that's how old I am

---------04:18----------
I that I'm really showing my age I was 5

---------04:22----------
I had been doing this already as a

---------04:23----------
business for five years at the time that

---------04:26----------
has well boards started getting used in

---------04:27----------
Apple products anyway so let's so the

---------04:33----------
first thing that I said is usually a PV

---------04:35----------
bus g3 how it will be short as a ground

---------04:36----------
that's what I've learned in older videos

---------04:37----------
so let's see what PV bus g3 hot shows on

---------04:40----------
this board so PB West g3 how can be

---------04:43----------
found on f71 40 right over here so we're

---------04:46----------
going to measure that on this meter that

---------04:48----------
I've got here 8.59 volts

---------04:52----------
not short it's a ground the next thing

---------04:54----------
we're gonna do wonder if it's gonna be

---------04:56----------
something buddy else's power good

---------04:57----------
circuit so let's see what we got here

---------04:59----------
this is a really nice lens that I got

---------05:01----------
here I finally upgraded myself a few

---------05:03----------
months ago to a lens that can do up to a

---------05:06----------
hundred thirty five-millimeter it's

---------05:08----------
pretty cool have you read your Wikipedia

---------05:10----------
page no if I did I'd probably get

---------05:12----------
depressed so I haven't so I want you all

---------05:15----------
to look at this and tell me if you can

---------05:17----------
see or get an idea of what's wrong with

---------05:18----------
this well I eat my food cuz my food just

---------05:21----------
arrived and I'm kinda hungry by the way

---------05:25----------
I'm gonna be getting those microscopes

---------05:26----------
very soon they're gonna be up on the

---------05:28----------
website for pre-order unfortunately the

---------05:31----------
shipping shipping cost for forty to

---------05:33----------
fifty pounds of stuff I slightly

---------05:34----------
underestimated so I may not be able to

---------05:36----------
make them cheaper than Epis on it may

---------05:38----------
wind up costing a little more but we're

---------05:39----------
gonna have some microscopes with this

---------05:40----------
nice top piece so see how this top piece

---------05:43----------
is over here see how there's like on the

---------05:47----------
left of the image or on the right of the

---------05:49----------
image no matter where you go there it's

---------05:52----------
in focus for just about the entire thing

---------05:54----------
so if I get this and focus nice there

---------05:56----------
this chip is in focus to my left this

---------06:00----------
chip is in focus to my right this is in

---------06:01----------
focus on top the focus doesn't change

---------06:03----------
regardless of where I am and you also

---------06:05----------
don't have that thing when you see

---------06:06----------
little rainbows shooting out of

---------06:08----------
everything I don't know if it's called

---------06:09----------
I've been getting at chromatic

---------06:10----------
aberrations whatever I'm not a

---------06:12----------
photographer but I know that the

---------06:13----------
microscopes that I was getting the old

---------06:17----------
ones that I had that did not he use this

---------06:18----------
that didn't fit this the new ones they

---------06:20----------
don't have that don't have this tube

---------06:21----------
looked pretty bad by contrast to these

---------06:24----------
so I'm gonna be selling some very

---------06:26----------
shortly so be on the lookout for a

---------06:28----------
pre-order option for that since I expect

---------06:30----------
them to be arriving at the port very

---------06:31----------
soon now let's take a look here

---------06:36----------
so this see what this resistor is for

---------06:39----------
are eighty-one 58 so what do you do

---------06:41----------
alright so here we have a transistor

---------06:43----------
that's gonna be responsible for hey what

---------06:46----------
do you know else's power good well

---------06:48----------
imagine that let's check this out so we

---------06:52----------
have all says power good here and it is

---------06:55----------
gonna be if PP 5 ESO pp 3 v 3s oh and pp

---------06:59----------
1 B 5s are present then this is not

---------07:00----------
gonna pull all those power good to

---------07:02----------
ground but if one of those is not

---------07:04----------
present because our

---------07:06----------
1:58 is broken then all suspended will

---------07:08----------
be pulled to ground so let's take a look

---------07:10----------
and see how this is going and let's see

---------07:11----------
if all says power good is actually

---------07:13----------
present on our board and then test our

---------07:15----------
theory here so I can measure all says

---------07:17----------
power good right there

---------07:18----------
and that's exactly what I am going to do

---------07:21----------
all us is power good is 0.01 volts no

---------07:24----------
good so I'm gonna turn on my fume

---------07:27----------
extractor which everybody getting

---------07:28----------
started have one of these also if you're

---------07:31----------
working at a place where they're too

---------07:32----------
cheap to pay for a fume extractor you

---------07:33----------
should just stop showing up to work I

---------07:36----------
know it's a bit of a strong opinion but

---------07:38----------
if your boss is making money off of your

---------07:40----------
labor and they're asking you to work in

---------07:42----------
an environment where you're inhaling

---------07:43----------
solder fumes that's something that I

---------07:45----------
really frown upon you know when people

---------07:48----------
say it's won by all means you know

---------07:50----------
torture your staff you know you torched

---------07:51----------
your staff as much as you torture

---------07:53----------
yourself but don't ask people to ruin

---------07:54----------
their health on your account so that

---------07:56----------
they can save a little bit of money

---------07:57----------
maddis that's that's cool

---------08:02----------
so we are going to change this resistor

---------08:04----------
over here

---------08:12----------
now this soldering iron is cool because

---------08:14----------
it has this soldering tip is cool

---------08:16----------
because it has a ball as is kind of but

---------08:19----------
not a ball is it it's hollowed out in

---------08:22----------
there so I can just put a bunch of

---------08:23----------
solder there and just have float that

---------08:24----------
side or over the component and then kind

---------08:26----------
of just take it off without having to

---------08:29----------
use the hot air like so beautiful

---------08:35----------
now we're gonna zoom in a little bit

---------08:37----------
more gonna get that and focus for you

---------08:45----------
all right so the top pet is there the

---------08:48----------
bottom pad may require some mild

---------08:50----------
scraping to get that to show again

---------09:09----------
[Music]

---------09:21----------
[Music]

---------09:29----------
you don't want to scrape too hard

---------09:30----------
because if you scrape too hard that's

---------09:32----------
all coming off the board as it's a piece

---------09:33----------
of copper it's attached to but you want

---------09:35----------
to scrape too little because I don't

---------09:36----------
want to be soldering on top of corrosion

---------09:44----------
I would normally use my tweezers but my

---------09:46----------
hot tweezers sound like this

---------10:03----------
everybody loves the hakko song

---------10:33----------
first thing we're gonna do here turn off

---------10:35----------
that loud nasty fume extractor make sure

---------10:37----------
the multimeter shows up back on the

---------10:39----------
screen you plug this in and as you can

---------10:45----------
see we're taking seven hundred milliamps

---------10:46----------
so I can imagine that all says power

---------10:48----------
good as present and it's also spout good

---------10:51----------
over here getting us a nice three volts

---------10:53----------
this is the thirty four thirty seven so

---------10:55----------
like the thirty four thirty five before

---------10:57----------
it's gonna turn on off on off on off on

---------10:59----------
as you can see right now it's on because

---------11:01----------
the fan is spinning but there's one last

---------11:03----------
piece that we missed over while taking a

---------11:05----------
look at this motherboard there's one

---------11:09----------
thing that we are missing here this one

---------11:13----------
little piece that may just need a little

---------11:15----------
bit of adjustment

---------11:20----------
[Music]

---------11:24----------
you want to talk about boys so that's it

---------11:30----------
for today so we were missing AUSA's

---------11:33----------
power good due to a corroded resistor

---------11:34----------
right by the transistor that will pull

---------11:37----------
it to ground if all the power rails are

---------11:38----------
not present the way it tells of those

---------11:40----------
power rails are present or by resistors

---------11:41----------
between that power rail and the

---------11:43----------
transistor and if they're all not there

---------11:44----------
the transistor will say analysis power

---------11:46----------
bridge straight to ground which is what

---------11:47----------
it was doing which is why we're stuck is

---------11:48----------
200 milliamps like that what happened

---------11:50----------
there is every single where I was

---------11:51----------
turning on beside CPU vcore because CPU

---------11:53----------
vcore will not turn on until all says

---------11:55----------
power good as present all its power good

---------11:57----------
not present no CPU vcore so that 500

---------12:00----------
milliamps that you see the machine

---------12:01----------
taking is different from the 200

---------12:03----------
milliamps it's taking without else's

---------12:04----------
power good because that 300 milliamps is

---------12:06----------
being used for the CPU so when the thing

---------12:08----------
is first starting on it is starting up

---------12:10----------
and booting up let's see if we do 18

---------12:12----------
volts 30% of that so the system is using

---------12:16----------
around 6 watts for the CPU pretty

---------12:20----------
efficient that's it for today and as

---------12:23----------
always I hope you learned something

---------12:55----------
excellent data recovery not the best

---------12:58----------
Cameron

---------13:03----------
what happened Steve what do you think is

---------13:10----------
gonna happen if you're standing that

---------13:11----------
it's me to run through it you went

---------13:13----------
through push
