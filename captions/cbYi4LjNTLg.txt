---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be going over an 8

---------00:02----------
to 0 2530 motherboard that is dead this

---------00:06----------
video's probably gonna be out of sync I

---------00:08----------
have a lot of other encodes going in the

---------00:09----------
background I just lower the priority of

---------00:12----------
them and I also lower the affinity so I

---------00:14----------
say only work on the CPU core and I've

---------00:16----------
filed transfers going I always try to

---------00:18----------
record to a different SSD than the one

---------00:19----------
I'm transferring files to and from but

---------00:22----------
yeah the reality is I mean to actually

---------00:24----------
put out the amount of videos that I do

---------00:25----------
in this quality on one computer it's

---------00:29----------
pretty difficult I'm thinking you know I

---------00:31----------
could just solve this problem by just

---------00:32----------
moving everything over to an encoding

---------00:34----------
computer that's just constantly getting

---------00:36----------
skull-fucked encoding videos but

---------00:38----------
requires buying another computer and I'm

---------00:40----------
cheap so I'm gonna stop this video and

---------00:43----------
see if it's actually in sync and if it

---------00:44----------
is then I will start and continue with

---------00:47----------
how we troubleshoot this board alright

---------00:49----------
so I think this did it so what I did is

---------00:51----------
I make open broadcast or high priority I

---------00:54----------
make sure that the drive that I am

---------00:57----------
recording to is not a drive I'm doing

---------00:58----------
transfers to and from I have 4 SSDs

---------01:01----------
plugged into this computer just filled

---------01:03----------
with one terabyte one terabytes of

---------01:05----------
random clips of like this board or pair

---------01:07----------
that border pair that are all unlabeled

---------01:09----------
that I have to go through later and I

---------01:11----------
also have a raid 0 array that I use for

---------01:13----------
capturing I figured that 2 SSDs in raid

---------01:16----------
0 will be enough for a one video capture

---------01:20----------
and also occasionally transferring stuff

---------01:21----------
but it's not so I have the I have so

---------01:24----------
many SSDs in this computer I've lost

---------01:26----------
count so I'm recording to an SSD that is

---------01:28----------
not an SSD that I'm transferring to or

---------01:30----------
from and I'm making sure that all my

---------01:33----------
encodes or renders are set to the

---------01:36----------
affinity the same core CPU affinity but

---------01:39----------
instead of it using all processors it's

---------01:41----------
only going to use one of the six cores

---------01:42----------
that being said hopefully this and this

---------01:46----------
 where none of my videos are in

---------01:47----------
sync it's something I could totally

---------01:49----------
solve by buying another machine which

---------01:52----------
again I didn't even want to build this

---------01:55----------
one but yeah so let's get on with it

---------01:57----------
hopefully the audio is fixed so we have

---------01:59----------
a green light in the charger the green

---------02:01----------
light and the charger tells me that I'm

---------02:04----------
burning my finger here great now the

---------02:08----------
board is telling me what's going on with

---------02:09----------
it already hello

---------02:12----------
I know so we have a green light in the

---------02:13----------
charger means PP 3 V 4 to his presence

---------02:15----------
if you watch my 1 yr circuit videos

---------02:17----------
you'll know why that is we need 3.42

---------02:19----------
volts for the 1 wire circuit to function

---------02:21----------
and for the green light to turn on so

---------02:22----------
now we're going to go over to the board

---------02:24----------
schematic and let's go over to the

---------02:28----------
schematic and go through the different

---------02:30----------
power rails on page 7 you're gonna find

---------02:32----------
all the different power rails in the

---------02:33----------
system I'm surprised I didn't just this

---------02:38----------
into stone did they even have PDFs in

---------02:41----------
2009 do they have like pen and paper and

---------02:46----------
ink I'm pretty sure because if I had a

---------02:49----------
guess I would have guessed that they

---------02:50----------
just had you know I would have guessed

---------02:52----------
that they just had stones and rocks and

---------02:55----------
chisels so in this old piece of

---------02:57----------
schematic what they do is they put the

---------03:00----------
most important stuff last and the least

---------03:02----------
important stuff first so what the

---------03:04----------
average person is going to do here the

---------03:06----------
mistake that the average person makes is

---------03:07----------
they look at this list of rails and they

---------03:09----------
start with the first one right no you

---------03:11----------
don't because what it's listing first is

---------03:14----------
s o rails so let's just go over what the

---------03:16----------
power states mean for a minute so we

---------03:17----------
have s 5 means you know the rails that I

---------03:20----------
would expect to be present when the

---------03:22----------
computer is off I'm just sitting there

---------03:24----------
with the battery plugged in we have s 3

---------03:26----------
rails I would expect to be present once

---------03:29----------
the laptop is in US in a sleep State so

---------03:32----------
let's say you know you closed the lid

---------03:33----------
and you see the little blinking white

---------03:34----------
light in the front that says that the

---------03:36----------
MacBook is sleeping you have G 3 hot

---------03:38----------
rails which to be honest with you I

---------03:40----------
never bothered to do the research to

---------03:41----------
figure out the difference between s 5

---------03:43----------
and G 3 ha G 3 hot means always present

---------03:45----------
s 5 is present when it's off so to me

---------03:48----------
that's the exact same and over here

---------03:51----------
we have s o rails the s o rails are

---------03:54----------
designed to be on whenever the computer

---------03:56----------
is you know on so it's on and working so

---------03:59----------
if the computer is not turning on why

---------04:01----------
would we check the so√∂ rails first

---------04:03----------
particularly if those rails are only

---------04:04----------
supposed to be present when them

---------04:05----------
computers on makes no damn sense

---------04:07----------
so we're gonna start with the G 3 hot

---------04:09----------
rail over here no as I said PP 3 V 4 to

---------04:11----------
underscore G 3 hot is already present

---------04:15----------
I know it's present because I have my

---------04:17----------
light and as I say if we scroll over to

---------04:19----------
the logic gate set up for you 6901 over

---------04:23----------
here you wouldn't pp 3 V 4 2 powers this

---------04:26----------
which will then power this hi-c which

---------04:29----------
allows the external which is the

---------04:31----------
chargers adapter sense line to talk to

---------04:33----------
the internal which is the SMC so we

---------04:35----------
wouldn't have any of that without PP 3 V

---------04:36----------
4 2 so seeing that light means that it's

---------04:38----------
present now if we go back to page 7 the

---------04:40----------
next rail that's supposed to be always

---------04:42----------
on is going to be PP 18 V 5 DC and

---------04:45----------
connectors now let's think about this a

---------04:46----------
second if the DC n board the DC n

---------04:49----------
connector if the charger wasn't

---------04:50----------
providing power to this board would I

---------04:52----------
have PP 3 before - no common sense so I

---------04:54----------
can skip over that one in

---------04:55----------
troubleshooting going down to the next

---------04:57----------
on the list as pp but G 3 huh this is a

---------04:59----------
rail that's supposed to be always

---------05:00----------
present so if I search for this I'm

---------05:03----------
gonna go over to this board view

---------05:04----------
software a lot of people wonder how I

---------05:05----------
find this stuff on the board I'm just

---------05:07----------
gonna N and it's gonna show me every

---------05:08----------
point that it shows up there's a nice

---------05:10----------
big fuse over there that I can check so

---------05:12----------
it's gonna and you can see the fuse

---------05:16----------
under the microscope right here so this

---------05:25----------
and I'm in resistance mode great see the

---------05:30----------
good thing about having this meter is if

---------05:31----------
I had the $10 meter it would have smoked

---------05:33----------
by now 12.5 2 3 good enough next rail on

---------05:39----------
the list is going to be the S 5 rails

---------05:44----------
right so let's check PP 3 V 3 s 5 so I

---------05:47----------
see that over here s 5 rails s 5 is

---------05:50----------
gonna be the stuff that's supposed to be

---------05:51----------
on while the machine is off so PP 3 V 3

---------05:54----------
s 5 so we're gonna find where that is on

---------05:57----------
this [ __ ] of 1995 software ok I

---------06:04----------
can find it on this little point thingy

---------06:06----------
over here so let's try to find that

---------06:07----------
point thingy on there customer walked in

---------06:12----------
alright so let's try and find that now

---------06:14----------
so we're looking for this probe point

---------06:17----------
that's what so as always the software

---------06:20----------
always loads the board view in the

---------06:22----------
opposite position that I have this on

---------06:23----------
the desk Oh figure and look at

---------06:28----------
how many dude what the is this look

---------06:30----------
at how many probe points there are on

---------06:31----------
this board look at this look okay

---------06:35----------
no seriously

---------06:36----------
now so I'm looking for this one over

---------06:38----------
here right

---------06:39----------
this thing yeah you know doing window

---------06:45----------
captures sucks because I have the mouse

---------06:46----------
in a different spot than where you see

---------06:48----------
the mouse let me just change that

---------06:49----------
because that entire thing sucks

---------06:51----------
we're going to add screen capture even

---------06:54----------
though it's one frame a second that's

---------06:55----------
better than in this BS screen capture

---------06:59----------
beats window capture by far so where you

---------07:02----------
going to do display capture add my

---------07:04----------
existing one and add you in love and bam

---------07:15----------
alright as much as you know it's not the

---------07:17----------
best but the very least that makes a

---------07:21----------
little bit here there we go so even

---------07:23----------
though the mouse is moving slow see you

---------07:24----------
see that probe point up there look which

---------07:26----------
one is that

---------07:26----------
this this this this this I'm just gonna

---------07:29----------
take a wild guess that it's this so

---------07:31----------
let's see what I get on the multimeter

---------07:33----------
which I can't see it cuz I'm in the

---------07:34----------
wrong do you know on the multimeter I

---------07:36----------
get 3.3 all right now let's check the

---------07:42----------
rest of the stuff in this area what

---------07:43----------
would I expect to see another rail that

---------07:47----------
I would be expecting to see let's move

---------07:48----------
up PP 5 vs 3 right P P 5 vs 3 let's look

---------07:57----------
for you

---------08:04----------
the Skype messages from a dude that

---------08:06----------
didn't pay his bill two months later one

---------08:09----------
thing you should do is never ever ever

---------08:11----------
let somebody give you a check like I I

---------08:14----------
had a bad feeling about accepting a

---------08:16----------
check from this dude and I need just

---------08:18----------
kept begging me for a part last minute I

---------08:20----------
just kept saying just buy it somewhere

---------08:21----------
else just buy it somewhere else just

---------08:22----------
buying somewhere else and he decides

---------08:24----------
that he's going to you know just keep

---------08:26----------
asking me and I finally just feel bad

---------08:28----------
and I give him the stuff and then he

---------08:30----------
gives me a check and like I

---------08:32----------
haven't taken checks ever in like the

---------08:33----------
one time I decided to take a check at

---------08:35----------
bounces checks are me really

---------08:37----------
think about this let's see what about

---------08:39----------
voltage are we getting here are we close

---------08:41----------
to our problem

---------08:42----------
a check is pretty much saying I don't

---------08:45----------
have any money right I have no money on

---------08:47----------
me I have no money anywhere but I have

---------08:49----------
this little piece of paper I'm gonna

---------08:50----------
write on it that I have money and if you

---------08:52----------
call these people like Seinfeld actually

---------08:54----------
had a good skit about this yeah it's

---------08:55----------
definitely from one of the first

---------08:56----------
episodes of Seinfeld like if you call

---------08:57----------
these people they'll tell you that I

---------08:59----------
have money I promise I swear it's like a

---------09:01----------
 absence note like taking checks

---------09:04----------
in 2016 for services or parts you

---------09:07----------
already provided is just such

---------09:10----------
 you that's Pete so yeah so we have

---------09:18----------
three point three volts there but we

---------09:20----------
don't and we have let's see we actually

---------09:22----------
have five volts here for pp 5 vs 3 do we

---------09:25----------
was I just we do yeah I may actually

---------09:31----------
wind up publishing that person's

---------09:32----------
information if they don't wind up paying

---------09:34----------
me but we'll see I'll give them a chance

---------09:36----------
but never give away if they haven't

---------09:39----------
paid for it it's the absolute worst oh

---------09:43----------
you keep skyping saying sorry I've been

---------09:46----------
busy blabbering I'll you you

---------09:49----------
pay me all right so now we move on to

---------09:51----------
the next realm because of that rail is

---------09:53----------
present

---------09:58----------
P P 3 V 3 s 3 let's see if this one's

---------10:02----------
present I also actually didn't check P P

---------10:05----------
1 vo 5 let's check that one that's a

---------10:08----------
very common one in the machines with C

---------10:09----------
seven seven seven one present where they

---------10:11----------
use the tantalum capacitor instead of

---------10:13----------
the instead of an electrolytic or a

---------10:15----------
polymer film oh my god what a [ __ ]

---------10:18----------
what a okay they're gonna call

---------10:23----------
it something different than I'm used to

---------10:24----------
it being called so I'm just gonna find

---------10:26----------
the component that I that that's on and

---------10:29----------
go from there

---------10:37----------
Oh

---------10:52----------
all right so yeah I'll just measure it

---------10:55----------
on see seven seven seven one as you can

---------10:57----------
see here they were smart and they didn't

---------10:59----------
use a tantalum sees little tantalum

---------11:06----------
piece of he's responsible for so

---------11:09----------
many dead 15-inch 2008/2009 machines and

---------11:12----------
then the kernel panicking in 2010 all

---------11:13----------
right so the reason I had to skip ahead

---------11:15----------
is I got a call from some [ __ ]

---------11:16----------
telemarketer so let's see do I get one

---------11:19----------
point zero five volts here is that the

---------11:23----------
right let's let's find the component so

---------11:25----------
I'm looking for this thing see seven

---------11:29----------
seven seven one right this thing over

---------11:31----------
here and it just changed the orientation

---------11:36----------
on me thank you board view software

---------11:38----------
all right so let's find this it's going

---------11:41----------
to be a camp looking up by here

---------12:04----------
interesting so P P 1 vo 5 is missing

---------12:09----------
am I on the right place here let's see

---------12:13----------
I'm measuring right how the hell can I

---------12:15----------
have PP 5 es 3 without having people

---------12:17----------
without having this one

---------12:18----------
let me just measure on the coil let me

---------12:20----------
make sure I'm not losing it again I'm

---------12:21----------
gonna measure on L 7 7 7 0

---------12:25----------
let's check L 7 7 7 0 we're gonna check

---------12:33----------
right here right by the mCP itself

---------12:51----------
I got after that four so that I can

---------12:53----------
smile on multimeter on the screen

---------12:57----------
nothing okay I think we're getting

---------13:02----------
somewhere but this really begs the

---------13:04----------
question though of how is it that P P 5

---------13:06----------
vs 3 can be present if the mCP isn't

---------13:08----------
turning on because the mCP is what's

---------13:09----------
going to send the p.m. sleep s4l signal

---------13:11----------
which is going to tell PP 5 es s 3 to

---------13:14----------
turn on and if I go here I believe P P 5

---------13:16----------
vs 3 is started ok it's not exactly all

---------13:24----------
the way there but you know something hmm

---------13:27----------
interesting

---------13:29----------
all right so let's see how P P whatever

---------13:33----------
here is created so this is created by

---------13:36----------
yeah what was I just done here we go

---------13:41----------
this is created by so this is gonna take

---------13:44----------
3.3 volts and turn it into the 1 point 0

---------13:46----------
5 so let's see pp 3 B 3 s 5 decided to

---------13:48----------
magically disappear so we're gonna check

---------13:49----------
on you 7750 I'm gonna check to see that

---------13:52----------
the enable is there and I'm also going

---------13:53----------
to check to see that it's receiving

---------13:54----------
input on the VN pin because remember

---------13:56----------
even if it's getting input on the VN pin

---------13:58----------
it's not being told to turn on nothing's

---------13:59----------
gonna happen so let's look up you 7750

---------14:02----------
here you 7750 okay you 7750 is right

---------14:09----------
here alright so I'm interested in

---------14:16----------
voltage on pin 1 and I'm gonna be

---------14:20----------
interested in voltage on the enabled pin

---------14:22----------
which is I don't even remember is it 1 2

---------14:25----------
okay pin 2 why the did I call it

---------14:28----------
something different p.m. g2 you know

---------14:30----------
 you call it what you call it on the

---------14:32----------
schematic I don't get this why do you

---------14:34----------
write this on the schematic and then

---------14:37----------
this on the board view this

---------14:40----------
makes no sense

---------14:41----------
it's just is Wow the stupid does

---------14:44----------
that confuse you alright so let's see if

---------14:45----------
we have voltage going in and enable

---------14:48----------
going in do we need both not just one so

---------14:53----------
let's check it out and see what we get

---------15:00----------
all right I think they take checks at

---------15:05----------
the meter they even take post-dated

---------15:07----------
checks at the meter yeah don't take

---------15:10----------
checks in business

---------15:12----------
okay so we're supposed to have 3.3 volts

---------15:14----------
going into this I see and we have 1.9 so

---------15:20----------
that even though I measured pp 3 v 3s 5

---------15:22----------
here's the thing

---------15:23----------
I measured pp 3 v 3s 5 just a

---------15:26----------
minute ago and it measured what it was

---------15:27----------
supposed to now it doesn't all right now

---------15:31----------
we're getting closer here now let's

---------15:33----------
measure around the IC responsible for a

---------15:35----------
PP 3 V 3 oh so this is the stuff that's

---------15:37----------
gonna get new people you measured it a

---------15:39----------
minute ago and it worked and now you

---------15:40----------
measure didn't it didn't so let's make

---------15:42----------
it let's check this out let's go around

---------15:44----------
the pp 3 V 3 s 5 area that's gonna be

---------15:48----------
the u 7200 I see this is the stuff right

---------15:52----------
honestly like I legitimately feel bad

---------15:54----------
for new people getting into board repair

---------15:56----------
because this type of stuff is just

---------15:57----------
fundamentally demoralizing when you get

---------16:00----------
trolled this badly so this created by

---------16:02----------
you 7200 so let's take a look at

---------16:05----------
something what's going enable some of

---------16:06----------
these S 5 rails right so we have Eno and

---------16:09----------
trip and end trip now the way this works

---------16:11----------
with the end trip ends is oh dear God

---------16:17----------
this is an awful schematic ok so

---------16:19----------
can anybody tell me where this goes can

---------16:21----------
anybody tell me where this line over

---------16:23----------
here goes this line from Q 7 to 21 where

---------16:26----------
does this go where the foot uni this

---------16:28----------
goes here right but how the would

---------16:32----------
you ever know that from this

---------16:33----------
schematic like this this board schematic

---------16:35----------
is so awful I mean you know why

---------16:39----------
they say over here do not reproduce or

---------16:41----------
copy or publish it it has nothing to do

---------16:44----------
with proprietary property it has to do

---------16:45----------
with the fact that they are

---------16:47----------
embarrassed that somebody may see just

---------16:49----------
how bad they are at the internal

---------16:50----------
documentation is it any wonder that

---------16:52----------
Apple products have a new extended

---------16:54----------
warranty or recall every single year

---------16:56----------
when they can't even draw how the

---------16:59----------
is put together properly for their own

---------17:01----------
internal documentation look at

---------17:03----------
this look at this what the is

---------17:06----------
this I got high that day so I just

---------17:09----------
decided to put you

---------17:10----------
and the line over here by this little

---------17:12----------
box instead of having it go up here and

---------17:14----------
what the is this well what's this

---------17:16----------
 look at this look watch

---------17:19----------
this line could go to the resistor and

---------17:22----------
go down but what the is the point

---------17:23----------
of drawing a box it's like I'm gonna

---------17:30----------
draw all and they just in they just

---------17:33----------
 pass out drunk

---------17:34----------
thank God I don't get if you're gonna do

---------17:37----------
this stuff do it properly

---------17:38----------
anyway the way this stuff works is

---------17:41----------
usually the chip is going to naturally

---------17:43----------
be on so you have chips that are not

---------17:46----------
always on and then you have chips that

---------17:48----------
are always on that have to be turned off

---------17:49----------
so for example E and O this means that I

---------17:52----------
have to send voltage to here to turn

---------17:54----------
this function on and trip means that

---------17:57----------
it's naturally on but I have to trip it

---------18:00----------
to turn it off a little confusing so if

---------18:02----------
I wanted let's go over to a back light I

---------18:04----------
see let's let's go over to something

---------18:05----------
simple okay so this chip has an enable

---------18:08----------
line now the thing with the enable line

---------18:11----------
very simple is this chip is naturally

---------18:13----------
off but if I send three volts to the

---------18:15----------
enable pin I turn it on that's enable I

---------18:18----------
send voltage to it to enable it now when

---------18:20----------
it comes to these end trip pins the way

---------18:22----------
these work is they're always naturally

---------18:25----------
on it has three volts being created

---------18:28----------
internally to turn this on now it's not

---------18:31----------
that I am going to turn it on by sending

---------18:33----------
voltage - it already has voltage there

---------18:34----------
what I have to do is I have to take away

---------18:36----------
that chips voltage that's already there

---------18:38----------
in order to turn it off and the way we

---------18:41----------
do that is with this transistor that's

---------18:43----------
going to ground right so there's a

---------18:46----------
transistor here that goes to ground it's

---------18:47----------
gonna take that entropy voltage and say

---------18:48----------
 you send it to ground I think I

---------18:50----------
hope my brain is not exactly been what

---------18:52----------
it used to be lately and this line is

---------18:54----------
supposed to be going to here because

---------18:56----------
that's where this goes to it doesn't the

---------18:58----------
electricity just doesn't go in a little

---------18:59----------
 box and go around in circles

---------19:01----------
like some stoner from the 60s it's about

---------19:04----------
supposed to actually go somewhere but

---------19:06----------
apparently I'm happy this is Apple

---------19:09----------
engineering think different well you

---------19:12----------
know what it let's just not think

---------19:14----------
at all so where was I with this ah yeah

---------19:19----------
so let's start checking the enable

---------19:20----------
signals here let's check en oh now en Oh

---------19:23----------
comes

---------19:24----------
from this resistor and this resistor

---------19:26----------
attaches smc PMG to en to this signal

---------19:30----------
and we can tell that because they

---------19:32----------
decided to actually draw a line and not

---------19:33----------
some random throughout that

---------19:34----------
part of the motherboard so I'm gonna

---------19:36----------
plug it in let's just check what's going

---------19:38----------
on with the enable signals here so SMC

---------19:40----------
PMG to e n right let's check that on our

---------19:45----------
72-73 so we're gonna go over to our

---------19:47----------
seven two seven three the way the Apple

---------19:51----------
writes out schematics be ashamed

---------19:53----------
to yourself man my handwriting in second

---------19:55----------
grade was better than that like it

---------19:57----------
may have been chicken scratch but at

---------19:58----------
least you could get at least the point

---------20:01----------
was there for [ __ ] sake take some

---------20:04----------
pride in your four hundred billion

---------20:06----------
dollar engineering four hundred billion

---------20:09----------
dollar company can't draw a schematic

---------20:11----------
what a joke Wow and I remember you like

---------20:15----------
I I've worked on audio gear with the

---------20:16----------
schematics that you got were literally

---------20:18----------
photocopies I mean like some of this

---------20:20----------
 was from the 50s and 60s so you had

---------20:21----------
a photocopy schematic of a hand drawing

---------20:23----------
and that was better than this

---------20:25----------
anyway all right so we're looking over

---------20:29----------
here OFA okay this is rotated

---------20:35----------
differently than how I'm looking at it

---------20:37----------
let's see yeah let's rotate this

---------20:39----------
properly okay so SMC PMG to en is going

---------20:50----------
to be on the left side of this resistor

---------20:52----------
and I got three volts now the side where

---------20:56----------
it's going to the chip is zero volts

---------21:00----------
okay so now we have two different things

---------21:01----------
that could be wrong here either that

---------21:03----------
resistor is blown and not allowing SMC

---------21:05----------
PMG to en to the u 7200 buck converter

---------21:09----------
controller or the buck converter

---------21:11----------
controller is pulling the signal down on

---------21:13----------
the other side of that resistance so if

---------21:14----------
that resistor itself is higher than the

---------21:16----------
hundred kilo ohms that it's specified

---------21:17----------
for in the schematic that means that the

---------21:19----------
resistor is blown however if that

---------21:21----------
resistor is a hundred kilo ohms or lower

---------21:23----------
that means that the buck converter

---------21:24----------
controller chip is what's pulling the

---------21:27----------
SMC PMG 2en signal down so let's measure

---------21:29----------
resistance on that and I'm pretty sure

---------21:30----------
that the signal is being pulled down

---------21:32----------
because that chip is intermittently

---------21:34----------
 itself up it's forty nine point

---------21:36----------
four kilo ohms which is below

---------21:38----------
100 kilo ohms which means that my use

---------21:39----------
70-200 is what's screwing all this up so

---------21:42----------
I'm going to turn on my Weller WH a 900

---------21:45----------
I'm going to you know take a break take

---------21:47----------
a piss make myself some breakfast or

---------21:49----------
lunch come back in a half hour hopefully

---------21:51----------
this thing will have actually heated up

---------21:52----------
by then you can tell them being a bit

---------21:54----------
snarky because my JBC died and now I

---------21:57----------
have to go back to this and I had no

---------21:58----------
idea how much patience I lost in terms

---------22:01----------
of waiting for the to heat up I

---------22:02----------
have none I have absolutely none I said

---------22:05----------
that this is a good device and I stand

---------22:06----------
by me saying that it's a good it's a

---------22:08----------
good device at 600 bucks but I'm spoiled

---------22:11----------
I like the $1,800 one I hate this thing

---------22:13----------
now I really do this thing takes so long

---------22:18----------
to come to temperature I've almost

---------22:19----------
forget what I was doing on the damn

---------22:21----------
motherboard so this chip got to go

---------22:34----------
okay now remember it's gonna take a

---------22:36----------
while here this isn't something that's

---------22:37----------
gonna melt immediately or even in the

---------22:40----------
you know we're back to the old station I

---------22:45----------
told you I can figure out if JBC as is

---------22:49----------
interested in fixing my my JBC for money

---------22:52----------
I sent them an email just asking like

---------22:54----------
what what would it cost me to buy this

---------22:55----------
thing and it didn't fail because it's a

---------22:58----------
bad station it fell because I'm an idiot

---------22:59----------
that shoved the spatula in there that I

---------23:01----------
was trying to use to heat up a macbook

---------23:03----------
air bezel and i stuck it a little too

---------23:04----------
high up in there and as a result of that

---------23:07----------
i sharted they shorted the heating

---------23:10----------
element to ground okay take the chip off

---------23:14----------
the board a lot of people get the

---------23:16----------
orientation of this chip wrong so what I

---------23:17----------
do is I actually solder it on my table

---------23:19----------
that's why my desk look like I

---------23:21----------
don't care if my desk looks like my

---------23:23----------
desk looks like but my chips are

---------23:27----------
always soldered on the right way because

---------23:29----------
I solder the component to the desk while

---------23:32----------
it's still hot I shove it onto the table

---------23:34----------
at the end of the day I knock all that

---------23:35----------
stuff off and I clean the desk but this

---------23:41----------
iron would look so much better if I

---------23:42----------
flipped it on heat

---------23:48----------
are we hunt yet we hunt you it were kind

---------23:51----------
of hot

---------23:52----------
there we go

---------23:59----------
that

---------24:01----------
beautiful sound that means we're at

---------24:03----------
Saturn melting temperature a lot of

---------24:05----------
people asked recently if I hate the

---------24:07----------
sounds of the hakko so much why don't I

---------24:08----------
take off the speaker I love that little

---------24:10----------
noise when it goes I'm ready that's such

---------24:14----------
a cute little noise it's when it goes

---------24:16----------
bad

---------24:19----------
non-stop willing when it does that

---------24:22----------
when I'm changing two irons that pisses

---------24:24----------
me off but if I remove the speaker if I

---------24:28----------
remove the speaker then I also I lose

---------24:30----------
that adorable little beep and I don't

---------24:32----------
want to lose that little beat and you

---------24:34----------
know I'm sure that there's probably a

---------24:35----------
method if I go through all the manual

---------24:37----------
settings that I can maybe turn off that

---------24:39----------
annoying noise when it's when an

---------24:41----------
unchanging ions it's just have you seen

---------24:44----------
how shitty the interface to this thing

---------24:45----------
is I don't want to read a manual to

---------24:47----------
figure that out the interface that this

---------24:50----------
thing is so garbage and bad that now I'm

---------24:55----------
not going through that alarm clock and

---------24:57----------
guessing what everything meets yeah it

---------25:00----------
may be in the manual but it's just it's

---------25:01----------
not if you have to read a manual to

---------25:03----------
figure out and make something stop

---------25:04----------
beeping then that's this lame

---------25:09----------
there should be some general user

---------25:11----------
intuitive miss to the process the very

---------25:15----------
least that just shouldn't its default

---------25:17----------
behavior should not be to be that

---------25:18----------
annoying but I love the adorable little

---------25:21----------
beeps that it gives me

---------26:01----------
okay and I can also see that whoever did

---------26:04----------
this tried to hide the fact that they

---------26:05----------
ripped the fan connector off of the

---------26:07----------
board I'm guessing that this has been

---------26:09----------
somewhere else before you see that

---------26:11----------
because that just came right off and

---------26:15----------
there are no pets

---------26:17----------
lovely so let's try and reconnect the

---------26:21----------
fan connector be nice

---------26:36----------
and then I'm gonna have to epoxy it down

---------26:39----------
there because it's there's no pads for

---------26:42----------
the anchor pins wow this is one

---------26:47----------
looking connector

---------27:13----------
it should be using a smaller iron for

---------27:15----------
this

---------27:35----------
a connector is screwed let's see if

---------27:39----------
we've made any progress

---------27:47----------
so what I'm looking for his fan spin era

---------27:49----------
I will be surprised that the fan ever

---------27:52----------
spins on this thing but with what that

---------27:55----------
looks like should it could work and I

---------27:56----------
probably wouldn't even get a fan spin

---------27:57----------
let's see

---------27:59----------
any progress

---------28:17----------
hmm no dice all right let's see is pp 3

---------28:24----------
V the pp 3 v 3s v go huh fans not

---------28:29----------
spinning because that's frigging

---------28:31----------
connector I'm probably just gonna have

---------28:33----------
to replace it alright let's see I didn't

---------28:37----------
turn it on because the CPU is not

---------28:38----------
getting warm so let's go back and see if

---------28:40----------
PP 3 V 3 s 5 is present shall we that's

---------28:49----------
pp 3 V 3 S 5 gotten anything pp 3 V 3 s

---------28:57----------
5 is supposed to be present on the input

---------28:59----------
of this I see so it's there alright an

---------29:04----------
able there P P 1 vo 5 is there okay so

---------29:09----------
we've made some progress here this is

---------29:10----------
stuff that I didn't have a minute ago

---------29:11----------
which begs the question is this thing

---------29:14----------
just turning on and I don't see the fan

---------29:15----------
spin because the fan connector is that

---------29:18----------
 up and seeing as I didn't burn my

---------29:20----------
face when I touched the when I did I

---------29:23----------
didn't burn my face when I touched my on

---------29:25----------
my chin to the CPU I'd say that it's not

---------29:29----------
on let's see shove the fan in there try

---------29:35----------
turning it on one more time from the

---------29:37----------
tweezers

---------29:59----------
no dice

---------30:09----------
all right so down the list and let's

---------30:11----------
continue troubleshooting here

---------30:23----------
okay let's go down the list what are the

---------30:29----------
other rails I guess I should

---------30:31----------
double-check and make sure that PP 5 vs

---------30:33----------
3 is still there

---------30:51----------
hmm

---------30:55----------
is not

---------31:01----------
pp 3v3 is there PP 5 vs 3 is absent yeah

---------31:10----------
that's usually supposed to actually this

---------31:11----------
is one of those older ones it's not

---------31:12----------
gonna show up until you at the power

---------31:13----------
button so I have to hit the

---------31:15----------
quote-unquote power button let me just

---------31:18----------
put some better solder joints on the

---------31:21----------
power button

---------31:31----------
these are used up okay

---------31:38----------
now plug it back in

---------31:53----------
nice firm press there to turn it on

---------32:03----------
well

---------33:23----------
you see what dumbass did here check out

---------33:26----------
what dumbass did cent n trip to feedback

---------33:35----------
that was stupid I'm not editing

---------33:38----------
that out no need to edit that out people

---------33:41----------
should see that I'm an idiot

---------33:43----------
alright let's try this again plug in the

---------33:47----------
MagSafe I plug in a fan and a hit power

---------33:59----------
yeah I'm a idiot I'm a

---------34:03----------


---------34:05----------
total idiot I bridged it but

---------34:09----------
yeah that was it so that you 7200 was

---------34:12----------
the issue

---------34:12----------
it was intermittently working I was

---------34:16----------
actually getting hot in the beginning

---------34:17----------
and I'm just remembering it now I should

---------34:19----------
have noticed that immediately but I

---------34:20----------
noticed that 40 minutes in because I

---------34:21----------
have no brain anymore and that's that so

---------34:25----------
as always I hope you learn something any

---------34:27----------
luck this is actually in sync but see

---------34:30----------
and man I don't know I still feel I

---------34:35----------
still feel better about myself than I do

---------34:37----------
about that dude that can draw a line

---------34:38----------
that drew the schematic but that's it

---------34:41----------
for today
