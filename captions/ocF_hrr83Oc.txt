---------00:00----------
okay so today I'm going to be going over

---------00:01----------
a MacBook Air that has no keyboard and

---------00:04----------
no trackpad now I'm not going to start

---------00:07----------
from the beginning because frankly I

---------00:09----------
work a lot slower when I do everything

---------00:11----------
on camera so I'm going to go over what

---------00:12----------
my thought process was I'm going to go

---------00:14----------
over how it is I solve the problem here

---------00:15----------
but it's kind of half solved already so

---------00:18----------
this is a MacBook Air that has no

---------00:20----------
keyboard no trackpad so the first thing

---------00:22----------
that I do was a look at the computer

---------00:24----------
just common sense to try to figure out

---------00:26----------
what is connected to what and I notice

---------00:28----------
that the keyboard connects to the

---------00:29----------
trackpad then the trackpad connects to

---------00:31----------
the motherboard via a cable so if the

---------00:33----------
keyboard and the trackpad are not

---------00:35----------
working it's most likely not that the

---------00:37----------
keyboard in the trackpad or bad it's

---------00:39----------
most likely that either the trackpad is

---------00:41----------
bad the cable is bad or the board is bad

---------00:44----------
now I tried a different trackpad

---------00:47----------
trackpad cable and keyboard combination

---------00:50----------
here and I had the exact same issue so

---------00:52----------
that's when you just go over to the

---------00:53----------
schematic and again a little bit of

---------00:55----------
brain usage over here so what I did and

---------00:58----------
I open this up and I measure and all

---------01:01----------
these points to see what I get

---------01:03----------
so this is the trackpad connector so we

---------01:06----------
have SMC lid the USB trackpad data lines

---------01:10----------
and a bunch of other stuff here so what

---------01:12----------
I do is I open up OpenOffice and I write

---------01:14----------
down the measurements that I get on a

---------01:17----------
known good board the voltage I read each

---------01:19----------
pin and also when the computer is often

---------01:22----------
there's no power applied no power from

---------01:24----------
battery no power from DC n board I also

---------01:27----------
measure diode mode measurements or

---------01:28----------
resistance to ground on the good one and

---------01:31----------
then I compare it with the [ __ ] one so

---------01:32----------
this over here is actually a different

---------01:34----------
[ __ ] one but the [ __ ] one that I'm

---------01:35----------
working on right now is this one and I

---------01:37----------
notice when I got down to pin 10 its I'm

---------01:40----------
getting one point nine volts at pin 10

---------01:42----------
so I look at pin 10 over here and it

---------01:45----------
says pp 3 v 3 S 4 which should be 3.3

---------01:48----------
volts when the computer is in an S for

---------01:50----------
State or up so the way power states work

---------01:53----------
at F ICP b3 b3 s 4 that voltage should

---------01:57----------
be there when it's in an S 4 state s3

---------01:58----------
state or an Esso state and so that's pp

---------02:01----------
3 B 3 3 point 4 over 3 point 3 volts and

---------02:04----------
I follow it up and I see that that comes

---------02:06----------
from our 48:30 now I know that pp 3 v 3

---------02:10----------
pp 3 b3 s 4 has to be present on this

---------02:12----------
computer it

---------02:13----------
turning on PP 3 v 3s OPP 3 V 3 s 3 PP

---------02:17----------
350s for all of those are required for

---------02:20----------
this computer to actually work and

---------02:21----------
function if P B 3 B 3 is for were

---------02:23----------
missing nothing here would work so logic

---------02:25----------
would lead me to believe that this

---------02:27----------
resistor over here ow

---------02:29----------
I mean this resistor over here is bad so

---------02:33----------
what I'm going to do over here is I'm

---------02:34----------
going to go over to the board view

---------02:35----------
software and type in our 48:30 and we're

---------02:38----------
going to find where that is on the

---------02:39----------
motherboard now on the motherboard our

---------02:41----------
4830

---------02:43----------
is over here and it's listed over here

---------02:45----------
as a zero ohm resistor meaning no

---------02:47----------
resistance so it says zero ohms meaning

---------02:51----------
no resistance so what I'm going to do is

---------02:54----------
I'm going to measure it and I'm going to

---------02:56----------
try my best to see if it's possible to

---------02:57----------
get that on camera probably won't be but

---------03:00----------
what the hell let's see what I can do

---------03:02----------
okay so I'm going to switch back to the

---------03:07----------
camera view here we go resistance damn

---------03:21----------
receptionist and the salesperson look

---------03:22----------
like they're about to murder one another

---------03:25----------
well they're arguing a foreign language

---------03:28----------
that's how you know it's [ __ ] up when

---------03:30----------
you when you hear people arguing in

---------03:32----------
languages that are not English but

---------03:33----------
they're English speakers you're arguing

---------03:36----------
is kind of universal in every language

---------03:38----------
like you know when somebody is arguing

---------03:40----------
with somebody it doesn't matter what

---------03:42----------
they're speaking it doesn't matter if

---------03:43----------
you speak the language at all you just

---------03:45----------
kind of know it's nits like it's in

---------03:49----------
arguing irritation has no language well

---------03:56----------
are they going to kill each other I have

---------03:57----------
no idea what it's over I have no

---------04:00----------
interest in finding out to be honest

---------04:01----------
with you right now

---------04:02----------
because I got a board to fix okay there

---------04:07----------
we go so that is going to be this

---------04:11----------
resistor over here it's supposed to be

---------04:15----------
zero ohms and the multimeter says that

---------04:17----------
it's thirty-seven thousand ohms yeah I

---------04:23----------
wonder why I don't have a [ __ ]

---------04:24----------
keyboard in the trackpad

---------04:26----------
all right so let's fix this [ __ ] I could

---------04:30----------
just put a wire there but that's kind of

---------04:33----------
ghetto but I could if I wanted to I

---------04:36----------
could definitely totally put a wire

---------04:40----------
there let's see I could put a fuse

---------04:50----------
there's a bunch of different things I

---------04:51----------
could put there

---------05:27----------
that was a little more annoying to take

---------05:29----------
that off then I'm used to

---------05:46----------
hey old solder is gone

---------05:54----------
remember you want to be efficient keep

---------05:56----------
the board you're working on another

---------05:57----------
microscope when you're stealing

---------05:59----------
components don't have it don't put it

---------06:01----------
under the microscope because then you're

---------06:02----------
moving [ __ ] around all the time

---------06:03----------
it's inconvenient when you're ripping

---------06:07----------
apart off of a donor board it doesn't

---------06:08----------
have to go under the microscope it's not

---------06:13----------
like you need precision or rip things

---------06:14----------
off you need precision to put things on

---------06:48----------
zero ohms and we put this thing back

---------06:59----------
together and see what we get

---------07:01----------
by the way again fav all these people

---------07:04----------
let's say you know oh we got a lot of

---------07:06----------
comments particularly from this one one

---------07:09----------
guy in the last video that I did a few

---------07:12----------
videos ago actually on how you know

---------07:15----------
you're not qualified your pissant

---------07:18----------
compared to the Apple certified centers

---------07:19----------
that have the right tools to do this you

---------07:21----------
don't understand how any of this really

---------07:23----------
really works

---------07:25----------
Apple quoted 750 bucks for this

---------07:28----------
you saw under the microscope this this

---------07:30----------
doesn't even have liquid damage I mean

---------07:32----------
it doesn't have liquid damage it's

---------07:34----------
literally one resistor that's destroyed

---------07:36----------
750 a week and guess what no data I love

---------07:42----------
it I just I love it I love how they do

---------07:44----------
that it's like not only are we going to

---------07:47----------
take a week charge you 750 but no date

---------07:51----------
ah

---------07:51----------
like if because that's just really the

---------07:54----------
kick in the balls on top of it I mean

---------07:56----------
it's enough of a kick in the balls that

---------07:57----------
the company that you bought this [ __ ]

---------07:59----------
from for 1700 bucks is not going to help

---------08:03----------
you at all and it's going to take a week

---------08:06----------
and they are getting rid of your data oh

---------08:11----------
it's yeah oneness 100 it's one on the

---------08:15----------
iPhone 6 error 53 video oneness 100 a

---------08:18----------
bunch of comments coming from someone

---------08:21----------
that's not an Apple authorized service

---------08:22----------
center that's completely meaningless I

---------08:24----------
have worked at authorized sales and

---------08:26----------
service locations for blah blah blah you

---------08:29----------
need a job within an authorized service

---------08:31----------
blah blah blah again you know what the

---------08:34----------
all you know what I'm going to do if I

---------08:35----------
work at an Apple Authorized Center I'm

---------08:37----------
going to take this board I'm going to

---------08:39----------
chuck it into a bin it's going to get

---------08:41----------
thrown away and that's going to be a big

---------08:43----------
[ __ ] waste authorized repair it's a

---------08:47----------
joke it really really is a joke for so

---------08:50----------
many different things it's just a sad

---------08:52----------
joke sad sad joke and I'm going to turn

---------08:57----------
this on and you're going to see that it

---------08:58----------
actually works my favorite comments here

---------09:00----------
service text tip

---------09:02----------
do not replace surface-mount components

---------09:03----------
because it's too time-consuming again

---------09:06----------
authorized repair authorized repair is

---------09:10----------
dumb it really is so I'm going to plug

---------09:13----------
this in and you're going to see that I

---------09:14----------
have a working keyboard which I didn't

---------09:17----------
have before because I am NOT an idiot

---------09:19----------
and because I'm unauthorized and because

---------09:21----------
I actually have a clue how to use the

---------09:23----------
[ __ ] brain that's in my head to

---------09:25----------
connect two and two to get four it's

---------09:29----------
just such it's such horseshit it really

---------09:31----------
is for [ __ ] this entire business is just

---------09:33----------
horseshit like the entire consumer

---------09:37----------
electronics repair business is just the

---------09:40----------
that's a steaming pile

---------10:07----------
plugged it in let's hold down my option

---------10:11----------
key

---------10:24----------
hold down option

---------10:36----------
it finished it's RTC reset and what do

---------10:43----------
you know the option key worked the mouse

---------10:47----------
is moving yeah we're all idiots in the

---------10:52----------
unauthorized repair community

---------10:53----------
I can stupid businessman
