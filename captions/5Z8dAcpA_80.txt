---------00:00----------
here we have a MacBook that is a claimed

---------00:01----------
no power problem let's take a look at

---------00:03----------
this MacBook all right this is using 200

---------00:06----------
milliamps which means either short to

---------00:08----------
ground on PP h g3 hot or no cpu vcore oh

---------00:10----------
nevermind we are at 12 point 6 volts so

---------00:13----------
you're not short-circuited just yet PP 5

---------00:15----------
es 5 present PP 5 vs 4 present PP 5 vs o

---------00:26----------
present CPU v core missing alright so we

---------00:33----------
don't have a short circuit we have a

---------00:34----------
missing power rail situation so let's

---------00:36----------
open up t 8 - 0 - 3 4 7 6 board view all

---------00:40----------
rights the CPU VR enabled that's going

---------00:42----------
to enable v core and it seems like that

---------00:44----------
actually comes from the CPU so the CPU

---------00:47----------
is going to enable itself wow that's

---------00:52----------
something

---------01:00----------
you're not telling the CPU to turn on

---------01:03----------
why are you not telling the CPU to turn

---------01:05----------
on little bored mmm it all says power

---------01:07----------
good present interesting office power

---------01:11----------
good is not present my it salsas power

---------01:15----------
good not present okay so we have to

---------01:17----------
figure out why else's power good is not

---------01:19----------
present before we figure out the CPU v

---------01:20----------
core issue

---------01:21----------
so what rails are gonna be required for

---------01:23----------
all says power good we need PP v ESO DP

---------01:29----------
v es I was there all right we need P P 3

---------01:33----------
V 3 s Oh didi 3 s I was there we need P

---------01:38----------
P 1 V 5 s so give you one of your 5 s I

---------01:43----------
was there crap

---------01:44----------
alright what else do we need we need P 1

---------01:48----------
v 5s oh you already checked that though

---------01:53----------
we need PG 5 v s4 RS 3 I believe I

---------02:00----------
already checked that one it has to be

---------02:02----------
there or else oh he wouldn't be getting

---------02:03----------
PP 5 year BP yeah 5v so all right P P 1

---------02:10----------
vo 5 soo has to be present and then DDR

---------02:13----------
I guess to be denied impress myself

---------02:14----------
let's see P P 1 vo 5 s o after this this

---------02:21----------
board will go to Paul who's not here

---------02:26----------
today's which means it'll go back to me

---------02:29----------
that's not good

---------02:35----------
and it's 1.1 that's present so let's

---------02:38----------
check DDR egg DDR egg P good and what

---------02:46----------
rel is this this is gonna be something

---------02:49----------
created by you 7400 let's check DD let's

---------02:54----------
check you 7400 alright so you're going

---------03:02----------
to create DDR P P 1 V 3 v let's check

---------03:12----------
that rail keep u 1 V 3 v

---------03:21----------
one fee 3/5 is 2 point 7 volts an

---------03:25----------
interesting all right let's check that

---------03:27----------
area let's see what we get

---------03:29----------
oh hello little chip that's green when

---------03:32----------
the rest of the board is nice and clean

---------03:34----------
what do you know so it looks like we

---------03:37----------
were missing CPU v core when I looked

---------03:40----------
the enable wasn't present now

---------03:43----------
I also noticed that all says power good

---------03:46----------
wasn't present I figured CPU V core is

---------03:48----------
gonna turn on at the end I figured we

---------03:49----------
were at the end since we had SL where

---------03:51----------
else we had an SL rail present however

---------03:53----------
this is one of those very rare cases

---------03:55----------
where even though we were in an Esso

---------03:58----------
state we were missing an s3 rail

---------04:00----------
typically g3 hot rails have to be

---------04:02----------
present then s5 then is 4th and s3 than

---------04:04----------
SL I was in an Esso state because we

---------04:07----------
have us over else yep one of my Asturias

---------04:10----------
is not right

---------04:11----------
and that was causing all this power good

---------04:14----------
to be missing so I checked all says

---------04:15----------
power good all says Powell goo is

---------04:16----------
missing I go down the list of rails and

---------04:18----------
on this board that was seemingly very

---------04:20----------
clean there is actually a little bit of

---------04:23----------
green and that's no good so we are going

---------04:26----------
to just take that and repeal get some

---------04:34----------
flux over there

---------04:45----------
this MacBook will spin the fan

---------05:00----------
didn't someone think you swearing this

---------05:02----------
3-weeks thing Paul is sick

---------05:04----------
somebody has to fix MacBooks while Paul

---------05:06----------
is sick MacBooks demand to be fixed

---------05:17----------
[Applause]

---------06:23----------
there's my WIC

---------08:19----------
so someone's employed plants and flowers

---------08:21----------
but all y'all put the jack so the audio

---------08:26----------
open circuit

---------08:28----------
oh poor MacBook yeah

---------08:39----------
what you do

---------08:42----------
oh that's own of the Krusty

---------08:51----------
and it spins with dad we move on to the

---------08:55----------
next MacBook
