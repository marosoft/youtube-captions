---------00:00----------
let's open the bottom of this MacBook

---------00:01----------
and see what the liquid damage inside

---------00:03----------
looks like as you can see here there is

---------00:06----------
a little sticker and that sticker says

---------00:08----------
Geek Squad this little Wi-Fi wire over

---------00:11----------
here is supposed to be routed in this

---------00:13----------
little channel it's supposed to stay in

---------00:16----------
that channel and then go to the Wi-Fi

---------00:18----------
card instead of being routed in the

---------00:20----------
channel it's been pushed out see how

---------00:23----------
it's going around here not the way the

---------00:26----------
wire is supposed to go wire is supposed

---------00:28----------
to go inside the channel I feel so bad

---------00:30----------
for this MacBook let's get our t5

---------00:32----------
screwdriver and take the screws out of

---------00:35----------
this MacBook the first thing we're gonna

---------00:36----------
do is see if it's been long screwed it

---------00:38----------
appears that they did not long screw the

---------00:40----------
MacBook as can be seen here they did not

---------00:43----------
put the long screw in the short hole

---------00:44----------
they didn't put any screw in the hole

---------00:46----------
can't long screw the machine if you

---------00:49----------
don't put the screws in yeah they're

---------00:53----------
thinking different alright what did they

---------00:55----------
do to you little MacBook how did they

---------00:57----------
hurt you

---------00:58----------
why thank God first you oh oh oh here

---------01:04----------
are the screws aha

---------01:06----------
they could oh this is smart look at that

---------01:10----------
they were storing them under the fan

---------01:13----------
great job Geek Squad great job

---------01:17----------
alright so under there we go there's our

---------01:20----------
screw Oh

---------01:21----------
upsy-daisy this MacBook appears to come

---------01:28----------
with a note due to a may concern this

---------01:31----------
MacBook Air 2015 was water damaged by a

---------01:34----------
cup of water the size of a Starbucks

---------01:36----------
Grande what's a Grande I hope data

---------01:40----------
recovery is possible

---------01:41----------
I pray data recovery as possible smiley

---------01:43----------
face Sincerely Yours visa first things

---------01:47----------
first we put the microscope over the

---------01:50----------
board first thing we see any tiny hints

---------01:56----------
of corrosion by the DC and board this is

---------02:01----------
a DC head board they would not be

---------02:03----------
reusing oh man I'm yawning yawning is

---------02:07----------
contagious now let's take a look at the

---------02:09----------
DCN cable that's definitely what you

---------02:11----------
should keep inside the customers

---------02:13----------
computer

---------02:13----------
oh yeah sure that's gonna make it better

---------02:16----------
let's take a look by the LCD backlight

---------02:18----------
area little bit gross LCD connector

---------02:24----------
definitely gross I'll use pins even

---------02:26----------
making contact with the board huh here

---------02:31----------
those pins are roasted let's take a look

---------02:34----------
at the LED driver's side on the other

---------02:36----------
side of the board an LED driver which is

---------02:40----------
responsible for LCD backlight is

---------02:42----------
actually looking good over here and the

---------02:45----------
thunderbolt area over here has seen

---------02:47----------
better days but a little bit of cleaning

---------02:50----------
will make that thunderbolt area just

---------02:52----------
fine I have no problem with this Thunder

---------02:55----------
both area my real problem is going to be

---------02:58----------
with pins 3 & 4 on the LCD connector

---------03:01----------
these are now if anybody wonders why

---------03:03----------
those are the first to corrode those are

---------03:05----------
for LCD backlight LCD backlight is the

---------03:08----------
highest voltage in this connector

---------03:09----------
everything else is gonna be 1 2 3 volts

---------03:12----------
signaling so minor corrosion you got you

---------03:14----------
25 to 27 volt backlight line this is

---------03:17----------
what's going to get corroded first due

---------03:19----------
to their being the highest voltage now

---------03:21----------
when you learn about voltage and basic

---------03:23----------
electronics they're gonna say that this

---------03:24----------
is the potential or potential difference

---------03:26----------
when we talk about voltage here think of

---------03:29----------
it as voltage is the potential to F up

---------03:32----------
your MacBook if you spill water on it so

---------03:34----------
the highest voltage line means the

---------03:36----------
highest potential to F up your MacBook

---------03:38----------
which means that's into the highest

---------03:39----------
potential to get screwed up that's been

---------03:41----------
3 & 4 and the other part that's the most

---------03:43----------
screwed up is going to be this DC on

---------03:46----------
board I'm not even gonna bother

---------03:47----------
replacing the connector on this because

---------03:49----------
again did this board over here this is

---------03:52----------
worth money this thing is not worth

---------03:56----------
enough for us to give a crap about so

---------03:58----------
first things first let's replace that

---------04:00----------
LCD connector with another one we're

---------04:03----------
gonna remove that LCD connector from

---------04:05----------
this board and make it look great again

---------04:08----------
it's get a nice clear view in the

---------04:09----------
microscope there we go

---------04:14----------
easy breezy why are you at work here's a

---------04:17----------
coffee I'm at work because MacBooks need

---------04:20----------
to be fixed and if I don't fix the

---------04:22----------
MacBooks who will somebody has to think

---------04:25----------
of the little MacBooks and it clearly

---------04:27----------
doesn't appear to be you MacBooks need

---------04:30----------
to be fixed as long as there needs to be

---------04:32----------
MacBooks fixed Luis will be at work

---------04:34----------
someday we're gonna live in a world

---------04:36----------
where MacBooks no longer need to be

---------04:38----------
fixed because people will stop buying

---------04:39----------
them or somebody else will be here to do

---------04:42----------
him when that day comes Luis will not be

---------04:45----------
at work now I'm gonna use this quick hot

---------04:47----------
air station which by the way we're going

---------04:50----------
to have quicks back in stock tomorrow

---------04:52----------
not just in - in 110 volts we're also

---------04:55----------
gonna have the 220 230 volt versions

---------04:57----------
back and we're also gonna have bent

---------04:59----------
nozzles back in stock tomorrow so if

---------05:01----------
you've been waiting to get a 220 volt

---------05:02----------
quick we are going to be selling them

---------05:04----------
again and we also are gonna have to bet

---------05:06----------
nozzles back in stock again for anybody

---------05:08----------
interested back to our regularly

---------05:13----------
scheduled programming

---------05:54----------
so we removed the connector as you can

---------05:56----------
see the pins responsible for LCD

---------05:58----------
backlight 3 & 4 appear to be at best

---------06:03----------
dirty

---------06:04----------
at worst missing when it comes to 4 & 3

---------06:06----------
respectively let's see if we can save

---------06:09----------
any of those I'm gonna use this hakko

---------06:11----------
fx-888 the BCM to tip one of my favorite

---------06:17----------
tips when it comes to wicking or doing

---------06:20----------
any sort of LCD connector on a macbook I

---------06:23----------
liked the BCM to tip me a while to find

---------06:27----------
a tip that i genuinely enjoy I'm very

---------06:30----------
picky when it comes to my tips so now

---------06:35----------
we're gonna add some let it solder here

---------06:39----------
and we're gonna suck up all that nasty

---------06:42----------
lead-free solder unfortunately we did

---------06:45----------
not use the right amount of flux so it's

---------06:47----------
not flowing as freely as I'd like it to

---------06:49----------
we're gonna use a more appropriate

---------06:51----------
amount of flux here

---------07:01----------
now see how when I went over this with

---------07:04----------
the solder and the flux how pins three

---------07:07----------
and four started to show up again that

---------07:09----------
means that my pins were not actually

---------07:10----------
destroyed rather it appears that my pins

---------07:14----------
were likely discovered with a layer of

---------07:16----------
dirt this is great news this means that

---------07:20----------
there's a chance that I may be able to

---------07:22----------
get those pins back without having to

---------07:24----------
run a jumper wire let's see what we can

---------07:27----------
do if we can make those some happy

---------07:29----------
little pins a little bit of gentle

---------07:32----------
scraping never hurt anybody

---------07:34----------
just scrape scrape scrape scrape and we

---------07:38----------
got a knot a nice flux and a board

---------07:40----------
reading some nice and let's solder the

---------07:42----------
iron's nice and hard not going over too

---------07:45----------
hard but we are scraping and it looks

---------07:48----------
like we brought the pad back beautiful

---------07:50----------
now we're gonna go over this with some

---------07:52----------
nice good wick good wick is the top

---------07:56----------
number one recommended wick by Jesse

---------07:59----------
Jones at iPad rehab and it's sold on

---------08:05----------
store dot Rossmann group com this wick

---------08:09----------
has a nice flux built in it rolls like

---------08:12----------
butter it's so beautifully smooth watch

---------08:15----------
this look at that Oh baby oh look at

---------08:19----------
those flat pads oh yeah those are some

---------08:23----------
nice flat pads Wow beautiful and

---------08:28----------
especially if you just run it over the

---------08:30----------
pads that had the damage and do a little

---------08:32----------
bit of this it'll be even pick up some

---------08:34----------
of the dirt that the soldering iron

---------08:36----------
didn't pick up oh my god folks do you

---------08:38----------
see this dad is Magic right there

---------08:42----------
utter magic beautiful wow those are some

---------08:51----------
beautiful pads maybe not perfect but

---------08:54----------
nothing a solder blob can fix next up

---------08:56----------
we're gonna clean that section of the

---------08:57----------
board I'm gonna take a q-tip combined it

---------09:02----------
with a little bit of alcohol a little

---------09:06----------
bit of alcohol do let's wipe that stuff

---------09:09----------
off let's pretend there was no damage

---------09:12----------
there at all

---------09:21----------
it appears there's a mouse in my office

---------09:23----------
a mouse just knocked over the two RMA

---------09:28----------
boxes I have for EM scope Wow

---------09:33----------
that's one determined Mouse he really

---------09:38----------
doesn't want to see me get my money back

---------09:39----------
for those lenses oK we've cleaned now we

---------09:47----------
just got to get ourselves a new

---------09:48----------
connector before we get the new

---------09:50----------
connector I'd like to clean the board so

---------09:53----------
we put some alcohol there the alcohol is

---------09:55----------
going to evaporate with some hot air so

---------10:00----------
I have some hot air there the hot air is

---------10:01----------
gonna clean off the alcohol

---------10:15----------
see also D connector has been placed on

---------10:17----------
our board let's get the microscope and

---------10:19----------
perfect focus there

---------10:20----------
I had a small amount of flux and flux

---------10:29----------
lovely beautiful flux mmm flux good ad

---------10:44----------
sense the tip of our iron like so didn't

---------10:50----------
get started now the first thing I'm

---------10:53----------
gonna do is I'm gonna hold the connector

---------10:54----------
down you want the connector to be flat

---------10:56----------
on the board you don't want there to be

---------10:59----------
a gap between the kick of the pins and

---------11:01----------
the pads see how easy that drag asada is

---------11:05----------
with a B cm to the BCM to tip make

---------11:10----------
soldering LCD connectors so easy for the

---------11:14----------
longest time I was using that that bent

---------11:16----------
tip but the joy of this one is just an

---------11:20----------
especially when you have to do the

---------11:22----------
anchor pads

---------11:23----------
watch how easy these go

---------11:34----------
just the right amount of solder yeah

---------11:38----------
beautiful

---------11:40----------
push down okay gotta add a little bit of

---------11:47----------
solder to that

---------12:13----------
you know this is a nice solder joint

---------12:16----------
over on this one see but this one has a

---------12:20----------
little bit too much on it I'm gonna try

---------12:22----------
and fix that real quick and it's gonna

---------12:25----------
empty all the solder on my iron by

---------12:28----------
putting it into the this it's a hack

---------12:33----------
this tip cleaner that I've got and see

---------12:38----------
if we can get rid of all the excess

---------12:40----------
there don't need all that excess we

---------12:46----------
don't need excess excess iPhone

---------12:50----------
excessive

---------13:02----------
all right that seems pretty good now

---------13:05----------
we're gonna go back to the thunderbolt

---------13:06----------
area of this board the cd32 11 cd32 11

---------13:11----------
is familiar to cd32 15 - involved in the

---------13:14----------
thunderbolt circuit the chip by Texas

---------13:17----------
Instruments it deals with muxing we're

---------13:21----------
gonna make that ship look happy again

---------13:23----------
add a little bit of Amtech nc5 v 9 v 2 t

---------13:26----------
efflux available at store dot Rosman

---------13:28----------
group comm LCD connector pins are

---------13:31----------
bridged indeed they are pins 3 & 4 are

---------13:34----------
very bridged they're supposed to be

---------13:36----------
there both for LCD backlight

---------13:44----------
now those capacitors over there will

---------13:46----------
likely still work it'll still function

---------13:48----------
this will still be a Macbook but I don't

---------13:53----------
think that they should stay there they

---------13:54----------
don't look like very happy capacitors I

---------13:58----------
think it's time for them to go it's

---------14:05----------
gonna touch up the joints around this

---------14:07----------
chip and chip itself is gonna be fine

---------14:09----------
just a not in that advanced age of

---------14:12----------
corrosion just then that needs a little

---------14:14----------
bit of touching up stage and then

---------14:21----------
replace those capacitors next to it that

---------14:25----------
have seen better days now I do use a lot

---------14:29----------
of solder but keep in mind all the

---------14:30----------
excess solder is going to get sucked up

---------14:32----------
onto my iron so it's no big deal

---------14:48----------
all right you got to go you got to go

---------14:51----------
you all got to go actually

---------14:54----------
sorry campus sitters we have standards

---------15:00----------
here

---------15:21----------
also sadly this user is likely going to

---------15:24----------
have decreased Wi-Fi reception so this

---------15:27----------
is what happens when you route the cable

---------15:28----------
improperly but here's the funny part

---------15:31----------
I shouldn't say funny I should say sad

---------15:32----------
here's what geek squad did check this

---------15:35----------
out people so right here you'll see that

---------15:40----------
this is where the screw hole is where

---------15:43----------
you would screw the bottom case into the

---------15:45----------
macbook see the screw holes now right by

---------15:49----------
the screw hole area you may notice that

---------15:51----------
the cables for Wi-Fi look a little

---------15:53----------
flattened and kind of destroyed this

---------15:58----------
happened because after miss routing the

---------16:01----------
cable they managed to accurately route

---------16:04----------
it right over the screw hole which they

---------16:06----------
then put a screw through they put his

---------16:09----------
screw through the cable for Wi-Fi and

---------16:17----------
gave it back to the customer unfixed

---------16:37----------
[ __ ] disgraceful looks like this

---------16:40----------
MacBook could still use some more work

---------16:41----------
pp 3 V 4 2 does not appear like its

---------16:44----------
present

---------16:54----------
we're not getting a light in the charger

---------16:56----------
but we don't have 18 volts by the pp 3 V

---------16:59----------
4 2 circuit pp 3 V 4 2 is the first rail

---------17:01----------
required in order to get a green light

---------17:03----------
in the charger as you may know from any

---------17:05----------
of my older one wire circuit videos when

---------17:08----------
measuring over here we're getting

---------17:10----------
nothing absolutely nothing going into

---------17:13----------
the diode so we can look around the q7

---------17:15----------
t10 area cousin my guess is that q70 10

---------17:18----------
which is going to allow charger power to

---------17:20----------
go through into the input of the pp 3

---------17:22----------
before 2 circuit is not working first

---------17:25----------
thing we're gonna do is measure the

---------17:26----------
voltage going in to q70 10 which is

---------17:29----------
going to be on pin 1 of C 7 T 12 or pin

---------17:33----------
one of our seven t12

---------17:35----------
so let's give that a measurement and see

---------17:38----------
it what it is that we get on input we

---------17:40----------
get 18 volts now let's see we get on the

---------17:44----------
output we get 0 q70 10 is not opening q7

---------17:54----------
t 10 over here is a p-channel mosfet i

---------17:56----------
would highly suggest watching my video

---------17:58----------
series on what is a transistor so that

---------18:00----------
you get an idea of how they work and how

---------18:02----------
they open in my basic electronics video

---------18:05----------
playlists long story short a p-channel

---------18:07----------
MOSFET is going open when the voltage on

---------18:10----------
the gate where it says g is lower than

---------18:13----------
the voltage on the source so we have 18

---------18:16----------
volts in the source I would expect there

---------18:18----------
to be a considerable amount less voltage

---------18:20----------
on the gate in order for it to allow

---------18:22----------
voltage to go through so this is like a

---------18:24----------
little switch where the source is gonna

---------18:26----------
send voltage to the drain only if the

---------18:28----------
voltage on the gate is correct it's like

---------18:30----------
an electronic switch so we have a little

---------18:33----------
path to ground here where our 70 11 and

---------18:36----------
D 70 12 are going to let some of the

---------18:38----------
power go through that's the idea

---------18:41----------
our 70 10 and our 70 11 are going to

---------18:44----------
send some voltage to the gate so you can

---------18:47----------
have 18 volts in the gate but then the

---------18:49----------
diode is going to drop the voltage by

---------18:52----------
sending some of that to ground so let's

---------18:54----------
take a look at D 70 12 and see if all

---------18:57----------
this stuff is good on this board so I am

---------19:00----------
going to unplug the board real quick so

---------19:04----------
that we can get it closer look under the

---------19:07----------
microscope

---------19:08----------
at that section and see why this is not

---------19:11----------
turning on and bring this board back to

---------19:13----------
its former glory prior to it being seen

---------19:15----------
by Geek Squad

---------19:28----------
I am gone all right now we should be

---------19:33----------
able to make a couple of basic

---------19:34----------
measurements I'm gonna plug this in and

---------19:37----------
let's see what we get now remember I

---------19:40----------
need the voltage on the gate pin 4 to be

---------19:44----------
less than the voltage in the source

---------19:45----------
another problem you're gonna notice here

---------19:47----------
thanks to Paul Daniels is terrible

---------19:49----------
software is that q70 10 on the board

---------19:52----------
looks different than it does in the

---------19:54----------
board view on the board we have a chip

---------19:57----------
that has four pins on the bottom and

---------19:59----------
four pins on the top but when you look

---------20:01----------
in the schematic and in paul daniels x

---------20:03----------
purple software you'll see that you have

---------20:05----------
one pin on the left and three pins on

---------20:07----------
the right this doesn't make sense

---------20:09----------
but if you've ever seen the way the

---------20:11----------
toilet water spends in australia you'll

---------20:13----------
get an idea that they don't really know

---------20:14----------
they're up from there down very well

---------20:15----------
it's fine we can forgive them and I'm

---------20:18----------
going to show you a trick on how it is

---------20:20----------
that you can use Australian software

---------20:23----------
even if you live someplace where the

---------20:24----------
toilet water spins in the proper

---------20:26----------
direction in order to figure out where

---------20:28----------
everything is placed on the board so

---------20:30----------
over here it shows us that the gate

---------20:33----------
which is pin four also connects to pin 2

---------20:37----------
of c70 12 so if we look at C 7 T 12 we

---------20:42----------
can click pin 2 and that is where we can

---------20:46----------
measure the voltage from the gate so

---------20:48----------
even though I can't tell how the hell

---------20:50----------
this over here relates at all to the

---------20:53----------
picture made by Paul Daniels is crazy

---------20:55----------
software what we can do is say hmm

---------20:58----------
according to this schematic the gate

---------21:01----------
attaches to pin 2 of C 7 T 12 so we then

---------21:06----------
find C 7 T 12 we then click on pin 2 and

---------21:10----------
now we can measure the voltage on the

---------21:11----------
gate so let's see what voltage it is

---------21:13----------
that we get on the gate

---------21:24----------
it appears the gate is 18.3 volts while

---------21:27----------
the source is 18 point 5 volts that is

---------21:31----------
not much of a difference as I said we

---------21:33----------
need there to be some sort of

---------21:34----------
considerable difference between the

---------21:36----------
voltage and the gate and the voltage and

---------21:38----------
the source P channel MOSFET is not going

---------21:40----------
to open unless the voltage and the gate

---------21:42----------
is considerably lower than the voltage

---------21:44----------
in the source which that is not at all

---------21:47----------
that's not even 5% that's not going to

---------21:49----------
cause it to open so what is it that is

---------21:52----------
going to bring that voltage down d7 t12

---------21:54----------
is what's gonna bring that voltage down

---------21:56----------
folks and that's gonna be if it has a

---------21:58----------
path through our seventy eleven let's

---------22:01----------
take a look at our 70 11 and d7 t12

---------22:04----------
let's make sure that the pathway where

---------22:06----------
our seven the 11 makes its way over to

---------22:10----------
d7 t12 is intact let's take a look on

---------22:14----------
the board and see if there's anything

---------22:17----------
that is looking wrong over here so first

---------22:21----------
thing we're gonna do is unplug the

---------22:23----------
charger because if the charger is

---------22:25----------
plugged in it's not gonna work properly

---------22:27----------
then we're going to put the multimeter

---------22:29----------
into resistance mode and we're going to

---------22:32----------
see if the top of this resistor makes

---------22:34----------
its way to the diode like it's supposed

---------22:37----------
to and it does see that zero ohms we

---------22:45----------
look on the schematic in the board view

---------22:46----------
into with the resistor which is right

---------22:49----------
here is supposed to make its way to this

---------22:54----------
right here

---------22:55----------
in this pin and two of the diode and it

---------23:01----------
appears to do just that we have zero

---------23:03----------
ohms there we can also see that that

---------23:06----------
resistor which is supposed to be 10

---------23:07----------
kilohms is 10 kilo ohms and I know that

---------23:11----------
because if it wasn't 10 kilo ohms then

---------23:14----------
we would not have any voltage on the

---------23:15----------
gate of q70 10 the issue here is going

---------23:18----------
to be the diode the diode is not working

---------23:21----------
as a result of the diode not working

---------23:23----------
properly it's not allowing the

---------23:25----------
transistor to open which is not allowing

---------23:27----------
PP 3 V 4 to to make its way to the board

---------23:29----------
which is not allowing this to work so

---------23:31----------
we're going to replace that diode once

---------23:33----------
you replace the diode I'll have a very

---------23:35----------
happy little board

---------23:37----------
a happy little board let's go ahead and

---------23:43----------
replace that diode now shall we so we're

---------23:47----------
gonna take that diode and we're gonna

---------23:52----------
put a little bit of flux on that diode

---------23:59----------
and we're going to solder that right off

---------24:04----------
of the board bye-bye diode he's nice

---------24:09----------
knowing it you're gone you're never

---------24:12----------
coming back

---------24:14----------
damn just like that

---------24:18----------
removed we're going to take another

---------24:20----------
diode and put it on the board

---------24:26----------
notice the diode similar to Paul Daniels

---------24:30----------
of software is laughing at me if we zoom

---------24:34----------
in on this diode you'll see that I'm

---------24:36----------
quite serious if you look at the diode

---------24:39----------
what is that that it says right there

---------24:43----------
look at that diode look at that see that

---------24:47----------
right there

---------24:49----------
ha that mother

---------24:56----------
that's how you know that it was the bad

---------24:58----------
component the bad component that's

---------25:00----------
keeping the MacBook from turning on is

---------25:02----------
the component that's laughing at you now

---------25:05----------
we're gonna turn this MacBook on and

---------25:07----------
it's most likely going to work little

---------25:12----------
[ __ ] diode thinking again laughs [ __ ]

---------25:15----------
mother oh crap we're still on as you can

---------25:19----------
see we're getting a light and if I were

---------25:22----------
to plug the fan in you'd see that we

---------25:24----------
also get a fan spin let's see if this

---------25:26----------
little MacBook has it in it the Buddha

---------25:28----------
chime dong give an Apple logo on your

---------25:32----------
screen check it out not only does the

---------25:40----------
MacBook turn on not only does it

---------25:42----------
recognize a charger not only does it

---------25:44----------
have a backlight on its screen but the

---------25:46----------
issue that the customer was most

---------25:48----------
concerned about which is that their data

---------25:50----------
which is in

---------25:51----------
an SSD wrapped in a geek squad skipper

---------25:53----------
was gone is not a problem their data is

---------25:57----------
there another MacBook saved from the

---------25:59----------
jaws of a terrible franchise or a

---------26:03----------
terrible large company if only these mat

---------26:06----------
books made it to people like us first

---------26:09----------
the Michael Lowell predicts the Chris

---------26:10----------
Long's the Tim Herman's the Paul Daniels

---------26:13----------
the Jesse Jones is the mark Schafer's

---------26:16----------
don't send your math book to Geek Squad

---------26:19----------
don't send your MacBook to you break I

---------26:21----------
fix don't send your MacBook to any one

---------26:23----------
of these large franchises that has more

---------26:25----------
money in branding than brains thank you

---------26:28----------
very much for watching and as always I

---------26:30----------
hope you learned something by the way

---------26:32----------
best buy you owe this woman in new Wi-Fi

---------26:35----------
antenna
