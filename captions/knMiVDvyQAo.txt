---------00:00----------
alright so today we're going to be going

---------00:01----------
over a macbook pro retina that doesn't

---------00:04----------
turn on this is an 820 4924 let's try to

---------00:08----------
see if we can get an idea of what's

---------00:09----------
going on here so it gives me a light in

---------00:12----------
the charger but the fan doesn't spend

---------00:14----------
which tells me that pp3 v42 must be

---------00:16----------
present so we're just going to continue

---------00:17----------
on and look around this board over here

---------00:20----------
for a little bit okay unplug some of the

---------00:30----------
stuff that doesn't have to be plugged in

---------00:31----------
for this put this on my side table here

---------00:41----------
get this on the other monitors I can see

---------00:44----------
what you see beautiful nice flickering

---------00:48----------
$80 acer monitor that i'm now using so I

---------00:50----------
don't just like I can see what you see

---------00:54----------
that that's that's the studio here let's

---------00:57----------
take a look at this board ok where is

---------01:01----------
our liquid you tell me when you see the

---------01:05----------
liquid damage all right I only got a

---------01:12----------
little bit of water how did it up

---------01:18----------
with only a little bit of water

---------01:21----------
everybody has to stress how little water

---------01:23----------
they got in it's dead I mean like you

---------01:27----------
can lie to yourself all you want about

---------01:29----------
the amount of whatever you got in there

---------01:30----------
but it is dead so does it really matter

---------01:34----------
does it really matter that you make sure

---------01:38----------
that I know just how little water you

---------01:40----------
got in there well you got enough in

---------01:44----------
there to make dead so it doesn't

---------01:46----------
it doesn't matter I would love to see

---------01:53----------
like the Dwayne Johnson from the 90s to

---------01:55----------
customer service on these it was only a

---------01:57----------
little bit it doesn't matter how much

---------01:59----------
water you guys think you gun oh man i

---------02:03----------
would pay good money to see that how

---------02:06----------
much water do you think you got in there

---------02:07----------
just a little it doesn't matter you

---------02:10----------
think you

---------02:11----------
in there all right so we have this area

---------02:15----------
over here disgusting this area over here

---------02:20----------
disgusting and this area over here

---------02:22----------
disgusting also that so let's just going

---------02:26----------
to create this split view so that you

---------02:28----------
can see my screen in addition to the

---------02:30----------
microscope and open bra okay so now what

---------02:33----------
I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna browse

---------02:37----------
around well how does some slow ass

---------02:40----------
 seriously ones like one frame

---------02:43----------
for second hello that's worth

---------02:48----------
 what the open broadcaster oh I

---------02:53----------
get it since I'm trying to capture the

---------02:54----------
screen at the same time and the screen

---------02:56----------
captures still up up to the

---------02:58----------
point where it only gives me a few

---------02:59----------
frames per second it's now actually well

---------03:02----------
that is lame as hell seriously see when

---------03:06----------
I go to the microscope capture its fluid

---------03:09----------
when I go to the screen capture I get

---------03:12----------
this is to look it's not even

---------03:16----------
the CPU limitation i'm using 12% cpu

---------03:18----------
down here as you can see in the

---------03:20----------
Mouse is moving thing look at this it's

---------03:23----------
never used to happen before what the

---------03:25----------
 did i do but now if i try to do

---------03:27----------
this oh well that is some painfully slow

---------03:30----------
video that sucks that sucks all

---------03:35----------
right let's try window capture show you

---------03:39----------
which yes i do screw that it's

---------03:40----------
all right let's try window capture

---------03:43----------
window capture land rex and we're going

---------03:49----------
to choose the test link land rex window

---------03:51----------
capture cursor okay okay that seems to

---------03:56----------
be a little bit better but we're going

---------04:00----------
to put the star tech card above that and

---------04:02----------
bam here we go okay it's a little bit

---------04:05----------
more inconvenient so if i want to show

---------04:07----------
you the schematic i have to always open

---------04:08----------
this and click back and forth which

---------04:10----------
sucks but for now this will do until I

---------04:12----------
figure out why open broadcasters being

---------04:14----------
an [ __ ] no no you know no insults

---------04:17----------
towards open broadcaster it's free and

---------04:19----------
does amazing stuff I don't need 100

---------04:20----------
bucks to it I should donate some more

---------04:22----------
it's a good software it's just sometimes

---------04:23----------
it drives me nuts

---------04:25----------
so we have this area over here and let's

---------04:28----------
check out what that is on the board view

---------04:32----------
ok so this nasty area here is DC in

---------04:37----------
voltage sense oh I don't give a

---------04:38----------
about sensors right now Apple is

---------04:40----------
obsessed with knowing the exact voltage

---------04:42----------
and current and blob every single little

---------04:44----------
part of the computer and the only one

---------04:46----------
that really matters to me when it

---------04:47----------
doesn't turn on is current sensing on a

---------04:49----------
hardware level not on the software level

---------04:51----------
where you know does does OS 10 get to

---------04:54----------
know what voltage we are I mean when the

---------04:56----------
ISL 6259 the chip that actually controls

---------04:58----------
the charge you want to know what the

---------05:00----------
wants to know how much current reason

---------05:02----------
that's the only time I really care let's

---------05:04----------
see what else is nasty so you got this

---------05:06----------
nasty stuff over here and that's for

---------05:09----------
sensing back light output voltage I

---------05:12----------
don't this thing's not even turning on

---------05:13----------
back like and suck it this over here is

---------05:20----------
backlight PWM for the keyboard oh my I

---------05:23----------
don't give a about that right now

---------05:25----------
you don't even turn on back like current

---------05:28----------
sensing resistor don't care about that

---------05:30----------
the computer doesn't turn on so again

---------05:32----------
what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying

---------05:33----------
to ignore all the that doesn't

---------05:35----------
matter I'm trying to figure out what

---------05:36----------
does matter because this is this is

---------05:38----------
important this is worth mentioning this

---------05:40----------
board is highly populated it is a lot of

---------05:42----------
different components on it a lot of

---------05:43----------
different circuits if I try to figure

---------05:45----------
out what's going on with every single

---------05:48----------
one at once I my brain is just going to

---------05:50----------
explode so what I try to do is I try to

---------05:52----------
break it down into sections and I want

---------05:54----------
to figure out which section is the

---------05:56----------
section where there's too much stuff

---------06:00----------
going on on on this board for me to

---------06:01----------
actually go over the entire thing so

---------06:03----------
what I do is I try to break it down into

---------06:05----------
sections and what I do is I want to

---------06:06----------
figure out which section is most

---------06:08----------
relevant to the problem that I have

---------06:10----------
right now so if I see to this corrosion

---------06:12----------
on the USB circuit and I'm

---------06:14----------
troubleshooting no backlight USB can

---------06:16----------
suck it will figure out USB later let's

---------06:17----------
focus on what we're focusing on right

---------06:19----------
now let's break it down into small

---------06:21----------
blocks so that we can then try to make

---------06:23----------
those small blocks make sense rather

---------06:25----------
than look at a 72 page schematic and try

---------06:27----------
to keep that in the end of the buffer

---------06:29----------
and our brain all at once so I'm going

---------06:31----------
to try let's see what we can do to make

---------06:32----------
this make sense before we do that we get

---------06:35----------
myself some more more this really good

---------06:37----------
blueberry juice

---------06:38----------
is every now and then I treat myself

---------06:41----------
every now and then you know it's not

---------06:42----------
it's not every day because this shit's

---------06:44----------
expensive but I'll buy a container of

---------06:46----------
the almond milk which isn't that

---------06:48----------
expensive it's like five bucks and I'll

---------06:54----------
get this and I'll get a like four or

---------06:56----------
five things of blueberries and those

---------06:57----------
things are expensive it's like

---------06:59----------
six bucks but yeah man it's such a nice

---------07:02----------
dessert and I'll put a bunch of the I'll

---------07:06----------
put all the blueberries in there with

---------07:07----------
the container of flat of the almond milk

---------07:09----------
and it is just it is better than sex hmm

---------07:23----------
there's two damn good man too damn good

---------07:29----------
makes an excellent dessert absolutely

---------07:32----------
excellent dessert except for when the

---------07:33----------
straw gets stuck back hmm Oh amazing

---------07:45----------
what a dessert okay back to work here

---------07:52----------
back to work man that is good that is

---------07:57----------
good pp 3 V 4 2 capacitors let's switch

---------08:02----------
back to my scene that I created here all

---------08:06----------
right so we have some corrosion by a

---------08:07----------
capacitor from between pp3 v42 and

---------08:10----------
ground I don't give a about

---------08:12----------
smoothing right now a happy b three

---------08:14----------
before two anyway so this is totally

---------08:16----------
irrelevant it's not like it's shorting

---------08:18----------
anything it's not really okay here we go

---------08:21----------
what's that hmm and that is for what's

---------08:29----------
that area a clock signal this is the

---------08:39----------
clock chip sis clock Jen well gee do we

---------08:45----------
want corrosion on the clock chip a lot

---------08:47----------
of people think the clock chip is for

---------08:48----------
setting the time and they'll go well I

---------08:49----------
don't care about setting the time right

---------08:51----------
now how do you think all these chips

---------08:53----------
actually no to work the way o'clock

---------08:56----------
works in most computers is this chitin

---------08:58----------
to think of it like see can I give it

---------09:01----------
like a political debate that doesn't

---------09:03----------
have a moderator it doesn't work because

---------09:04----------
everybody just starts screaming at one

---------09:06----------
another all at the same time and nobody

---------09:07----------
actually gets to make a point the way a

---------09:09----------
political debate works when it makes

---------09:11----------
sense when it's actually something that

---------09:12----------
people can listen to and learn from this

---------09:14----------
person gets the talk then this person

---------09:16----------
gets the robot then this person gets to

---------09:19----------
rebut then this person gets to talk

---------09:21----------
somebody says you get this much time to

---------09:23----------
talk then you get this much time to talk

---------09:24----------
in computers work the same way often you

---------09:26----------
have a clock and it'll be a much much

---------09:29----------
faster clock you'll have a 32 kilohertz

---------09:30----------
clock or a 25 megahertz clock the whole

---------09:33----------
idea is the clock is there to say you

---------09:34----------
can talk now now you can talk

---------09:37----------
you can talk now you can talk now you

---------09:38----------
can be a cpu now you can be a process of

---------09:41----------
its whatever the hell it is that they're

---------09:43----------
doing very oversimplified explanation

---------09:45----------
without a clock circuit it's not that

---------09:47----------
the computer's not going to tell time

---------09:49----------
it's that it's not going to work at all

---------09:51----------
so you need a clock or else none of this

---------09:53----------
is going to work then I'll that clock

---------09:55----------
from that ship that goes directly to the

---------09:57----------
PCH and the CPU which is responsible for

---------09:59----------
many of the PM sleep signals that like

---------10:02----------
p.m. underscore sleep on the score s4

---------10:04----------
underscore l and PM underscore sleep

---------10:06----------
underscore st underscore l which are

---------10:08----------
going to tell the computer wake up from

---------10:09----------
an s4 state wake up from an s3 state

---------10:11----------
allow these power rails to turn on a

---------10:13----------
work and without those be signals being

---------10:15----------
present nothing's going to work and the

---------10:17----------
clock chip is needed for that so there

---------10:18----------
we have something that's relevant but

---------10:20----------
with that said let's continue going

---------10:21----------
through our board and see if we can find

---------10:23----------
anything else that's relevant to our

---------10:25----------
issue Oh what oh that that's gross okay

---------10:34----------
this is obviously very relevant very

---------10:37----------
relevant over here let's figure out what

---------10:40----------
that is what's that use 7870 okay so

---------10:48----------
what's going on with you 7870 what is

---------10:50----------
your purpose well now we have to go over

---------10:55----------
to the schematic and oh this is going to

---------10:58----------
suck all right this this is where I have

---------10:59----------
to go and open broadcaster and tell it

---------11:02----------
to change over to the i miss screen

---------11:05----------
capture I like to win screen capture

---------11:07----------
worked i think it was so cool when

---------11:08----------
korean screen capture worked now i have

---------11:11----------
to set it to view the PDF reader and

---------11:14----------
here we go capture cursor all right so

---------11:19----------
where were we we were at you 70 fine

---------11:25----------
where was I what was I doing

---------11:32----------
I'm looking at a clock chip on a

---------11:34----------
motherboard that's not the same as the

---------11:35----------
one that's on the table okay what do I

---------11:39----------
have in the microscope that would be a

---------11:41----------
good hint okay what the hell is that all

---------11:45----------
right so let's go to the board view hmm

---------11:57----------
I'm on a board view for an air it's no

---------12:00----------
good is this the board before this is

---------12:04----------
another boy before an air that's no good

---------12:07----------
another haha okay i was looking at you

---------12:10----------
7870 i lost track this there so you 7870

---------12:15----------
on the retina which would board is this

---------12:20----------
this is an 820 4924

---------12:33----------
you 7870 here we go what is this thing's

---------12:39----------
purpose this thing takes 3.3 volts and

---------12:43----------
turns it into 1.5 volts yeah I'm pretty

---------12:47----------
sure that's important so clock circuit

---------12:50----------
looks messed up and this looks messed up

---------12:52----------
and this is an SL rail so PP 1 B 5s Oh

---------12:55----------
what does that go to what is the point

---------12:57----------
of that that's used by the CPU so the

---------13:05----------
CPU thinks that's important I kind of

---------13:08----------
want my cpu to turn on now don't I so

---------13:11----------
this yeah I mean do you even have to

---------13:15----------
matter this i mean like we would you

---------13:17----------
even bother taking out a multimeter I

---------13:19----------
wouldn't bother taking out a multimeter

---------13:20----------
it seems like a complete waste of time

---------13:29----------
let's get our air filter on you don't

---------13:32----------
want to inhale any of this

---------13:41----------
you

---------13:43----------
let's get a donor board and get to work

---------13:51----------
by the way I'm not using the board view

---------13:53----------
for this model board i'm using the board

---------13:55----------
view for an 820 3476 because there is no

---------13:59----------
board view released for the board that

---------14:01----------
i'm actually working on you may be

---------14:05----------
wondering Louis you work on Apple

---------14:06----------
products right can't you just ask Apple

---------14:08----------
for a push yeah nice fantasy world you

---------14:13----------
live in no it's supposed to be hard are

---------14:18----------
you what are you new to this channel you

---------14:21----------
don't understand how it works you're not

---------14:22----------
allowed to have any of this stuff

---------14:32----------
it doesn't really matter though that's

---------14:35----------
the thing like it makes it harder but

---------14:37----------
that's kind of that's a big part of what

---------14:39----------
actually inspired this channel I mean I

---------14:41----------
know that they like I know that it's

---------14:43----------
difficult and I know that they go out of

---------14:45----------
their way to make it difficult but

---------14:47----------
that's why I go out of my way to make it

---------14:48----------
easy for other people so for every bit

---------14:51----------
of effort in time that they put into

---------14:53----------
making it harder for you to fix

---------14:55----------
motherboards I'm going to put effort in

---------14:57----------
to make sure that it's easier for all

---------14:59----------
the people who watch this stuff to fix

---------15:00----------
motherboards and hopefully I'm doing a

---------15:02----------
bit more to make it easy than they are

---------15:03----------
to make it hard but that's the idea I

---------15:07----------
get a kick out of it

---------15:24----------
really liking this monitor right in

---------15:26----------
front of the microscope I can see

---------15:27----------
exactly what you guys see it is some

---------15:30----------
cheap flickering acer that i bought in

---------15:31----------
2011 but does the job i'm happy with the

---------15:37----------
job that it does

---------15:42----------
if it was like a regular money you know

---------15:45----------
monitor that was actually important I

---------15:47----------
wouldn't be but this is not it's good to

---------15:50----------
keep this stuff receptionist calls me a

---------15:53----------
pack rat I don't throw anything away

---------16:02----------
I have all these monitors here for like

---------16:04----------
shipping workstations and stuff and when

---------16:06----------
I ran the screen supply company and

---------16:08----------
thought I was some awful soldering that

---------16:11----------
was bad don't don't don't do as I just

---------16:13----------
did yeah I have all these monitors and

---------16:17----------
all these like crappy like core2duo

---------16:19----------
Lenovo's from 2006 from all these

---------16:22----------
different ideas that I had that failed

---------16:26----------
well I kept them around they come in

---------16:28----------
handy for things

---------16:41----------
let's get rid of all that excess

---------16:53----------
CP one of the big Mystery's ins I

---------16:56----------
include all these mistakes instead of

---------16:57----------
editing the mountain redoing them

---------16:59----------
because I know that people are going to

---------17:00----------
make them like well what I have people

---------17:02----------
here for the tutoring right I love

---------17:03----------
people here today they come for the

---------17:04----------
motherboard repair tutoring and they'll

---------17:06----------
they'll up and put too much solder

---------17:08----------
on a pad and man they will spend like

---------17:10----------
they will spare they will go if I'm go

---------17:13----------
to lunch or something and I come back

---------17:15----------
it'll be 20 minutes and i'll still be

---------17:16----------
trying to get a perfect amount of solder

---------17:18----------
on that Center pair they think it has to

---------17:19----------
be so artfully perfectly done are you

---------17:22----------
kidding me well if you have too much

---------17:24----------
solder you shove your in there and

---------17:26----------
then you can clean it off later just get

---------17:28----------
what's important done is getting it on

---------17:31----------
the board and flat like so as long as

---------17:34----------
you push down you know you've made some

---------17:36----------
good flat contact you're good sadhus

---------17:38----------
jumps out the side add some flux and

---------17:40----------
clean it up not a big deal at all I want

---------17:46----------
you guys to watch this and understand

---------17:48----------
what isn't is not a big deal everybody's

---------17:53----------
going to screw something up especially

---------17:55----------
if you knew it's realizing that your

---------17:59----------
screw-ups are not fatal that will make

---------18:02----------
you efficient that you're caring too

---------18:07----------
much about the wrong things spending 20

---------18:10----------
minutes to get the exact amount of

---------18:11----------
solder if you're a beginner on the

---------18:13----------
center pad is not important because by

---------18:15----------
then your brain is going to be worn out

---------18:17----------
for the things that actually matter like

---------18:19----------
figuring out what's wrong with the

---------18:21----------
system

---------18:33----------
I think that guy lied to this isn't even

---------18:35----------
he said water pretty sure this is wine

---------18:41----------
yeah that scrape away the wine okay now

---------18:46----------
we go up to that area with the clock

---------18:47----------
chip hmm do I trust that clock chip also

---------18:52----------
another thing by the way I know what

---------18:54----------
some people are thinking is well don't

---------18:56----------
you're not using the scientific method

---------18:57----------
don't you want to know exactly what's

---------18:59----------
wrong like what why are you replacing

---------19:01----------
multiple things at once because now

---------19:04----------
you're never going to know if it was the

---------19:05----------
clock chip or the pp 3v3 it's a PP 1 B 5

---------19:08----------
chip you know what I don't care if you

---------19:12----------
want to be what's the what's the word if

---------19:15----------
you want to be efficient at this you

---------19:19----------
want to be efficient at solving liquid

---------19:20----------
damage where you have a board that has a

---------19:22----------
72 page schematic with hundreds of

---------19:26----------
thousands of little components on you

---------19:27----------
want to be efficient at that you have to

---------19:28----------
get rid of the water damage you have to

---------19:30----------
make it like water wasn't there as

---------19:32----------
quickly as you can right and that means

---------19:37----------
I'm not going to stop and measure and

---------19:39----------
turn things on with every single step

---------19:41----------
I'm just going to try to make it look

---------19:43----------
like the water wasn't there once i'm

---------19:46----------
done with that I keep in mind what well

---------19:48----------
you know what looked bad what was worked

---------19:50----------
on and go from there you have to be

---------19:56----------
efficient with this because again this

---------19:57----------
so did this thousands of components in

---------19:58----------
this little bored you know there's so

---------20:02----------
many it's about condensing the amount of

---------20:06----------
time you put into it so that you don't

---------20:07----------
become fatigued mentally fatigued or

---------20:09----------
exhausted I spend a lot of my day trying

---------20:12----------
to come up with little ways to ensure

---------20:13----------
that I don't become mentally fatigued or

---------20:16----------
exhausted because once you become

---------20:18----------
mentally fatigued exhausted its all this

---------20:21----------
will all start to write somebody just

---------20:25----------
walked in okay back to work so

---------20:30----------
correcting that mess

---------20:34----------
what a mess that is

---------21:00----------
as long as it's flattened the board this

---------21:02----------
works it's not flat on the board then

---------21:04----------
you're kind of screwed because it won't

---------21:08----------
make a good connection you can always

---------21:12----------
correct these little things and then we

---------21:16----------
just go around the parts that had some

---------21:17----------
corrosion some like this stuff over here

---------21:32----------
turn on the hot air

---------22:03----------
let's see if we have any progress so I'm

---------22:07----------
going to plug it in and this is the

---------22:09----------
newer model where the fan doesn't spin

---------22:10----------
when the machine first turns on so the

---------22:18----------
way I tell if it's just turned on since

---------22:20----------
the fan doesn't spend as I measure V

---------22:22----------
Corps I get cpu vico I assume that it's

---------22:25----------
turned on so if i get cpu vcore Here I

---------22:34----------
am

---------22:41----------
well yay it works pretty cool the fan

---------22:50----------
actually did starts spinning which is

---------22:51----------
interesting because usually they don't

---------22:54----------
hmm that is interesting the fan usually

---------22:58----------
doesn't spin when this comes on maybe

---------23:00----------
there was an efi update or something

---------23:01----------
it's possible there was if he Apple

---------23:04----------
figured out that they you know that the

---------23:07----------
fan should spin on a computer that has a

---------23:08----------
powerful processor when you turn it on

---------23:11----------
hey that's something I've been

---------23:14----------
suggesting in the past few videos but

---------23:15----------
what do I know so hopefully you learned

---------23:18----------
something hopefully that was somewhat

---------23:19----------
informative and hopefully you will be

---------23:22----------
able to fix something as a result of

---------23:24----------
watching these videos thank you very

---------23:25----------
much and that's it for today
