---------00:01----------
Heather says I can definitely appreciate

---------00:03----------
someone who knows their way around SMD

---------00:04----------
components Heather say no more

---------00:07----------
this man right here this is a catch this

---------00:12----------
is a catch she's charming he's got

---------00:13----------
manners

---------00:14----------
he wears a beanie okay I mean forget the

---------00:17----------
fact that he wears a beanie that

---------00:18----------
probably works against him

---------00:19----------
he's from Staten Island he's single and

---------00:24----------
he works here he fixes boards find out

---------00:31----------
who took the ethernet cord away and hang

---------00:33----------
them hey everybody how's it going so

---------00:34----------
here we have in a 1706 that is not

---------00:38----------
turning on it says no power let's take a

---------00:39----------
look and see what's going on with it all

---------00:43----------
right so what we're gonna do with this

---------00:44----------
is same that I do with all of them um

---------00:46----------
plug the battery

---------01:02----------
plug in the USB C charger with a USB C

---------01:05----------
amp meter and see what it does 5 volts

---------01:09----------
10 milliamps stuck so never negotiate 20

---------01:14----------
volts with the USB C charger all right

---------01:21----------
so we're stuck at 5 volts let's see if

---------01:23----------
we can figure out why that is take the

---------01:25----------
board out of the case this is a

---------01:26----------
considerably larger pain in the ass to

---------01:28----------
take the board out of the case than the

---------01:29----------
MacBook Air because you got screws under

---------01:32----------
stuff and you have t3 screws and t5

---------01:35----------
screws because it totally makes sense to

---------01:36----------
use two different types of screws on one

---------01:38----------
motherboard its apps cuz you know it's a

---------01:40----------
great idea it wasn't complicated enough

---------01:42----------
it's not bad enough that when you take

---------01:44----------
the bottom cover off this machine it

---------01:46----------
cuts your fingers got to use multiple

---------01:48----------
different types of screws just to make

---------01:51----------
sure the person opening it feels extra

---------01:54----------
valued

---------02:02----------
no John and I'm not going to for an

---------02:05----------
absolute minimum of one to two years

---------02:07----------
because for the first li people treat

---------02:09----------
their stuff nice when they first get it

---------02:10----------
they don't treat it like and it's

---------02:12----------
kinda like shoes people don't treat it

---------02:13----------
like until they start getting

---------02:15----------
scuffs on them and then they treat it

---------02:16----------
like and it eventually breaks and

---------02:18----------
that takes about a year to do and B I

---------02:20----------
don't know the parts are not going to be

---------02:22----------
available so the supply chains it

---------02:24----------
usually takes one or two years for this

---------02:27----------
stuff to be available so when they

---------02:28----------
release the macbook air they released

---------02:30----------
the a 1369 in the my macbook air in 2010

---------02:33----------
and they released the a 1466 macbook air

---------02:36----------
in 2012 they both use the same screen

---------02:39----------
that screen was not available to me

---------02:40----------
until summer of 2013 I you not and

---------02:44----------
that was back when I had a lot of supply

---------02:45----------
contacts from running the supply company

---------02:48----------
that was back when I had access to a lot

---------02:52----------
of LG distributors in South Korea and

---------02:56----------
Taipei most of the people think that

---------02:58----------
stuff originates in China but when it

---------03:00----------
comes to LCD screens it's usually type-a

---------03:02----------
and that was three years three years

---------03:06----------
after the machine was released for me to

---------03:08----------
just be able to buy a screen for it so a

---------03:12----------
lot of people have this misconception

---------03:13----------
that I can get stuff immediately he was

---------03:15----------
there I started to cry I think says

---------03:17----------
Rockford why would you cry over Tim Cook

---------03:19----------
a lot of people think that as soon as

---------03:21----------
something comes out I have Parts I don't

---------03:23----------
care because when something is new

---------03:25----------
nothing's available or the stuff that's

---------03:27----------
available is only used pulls from

---------03:29----------
machines that people bought at retail

---------03:30----------
which means that the prices are insane

---------03:32----------
which means it doesn't make sense it's

---------03:34----------
like when a new iPhone comes out people

---------03:35----------
say are you fixing the iPhone 12 yet no

---------03:38----------
the screen is gonna cost me $400 part by

---------03:41----------
itself if I quote even half that to a

---------03:43----------
customer they're gonna tell me to go

---------03:44----------
 myself so there's just no point

---------03:46----------
hey I remember when the iPhone 5 came

---------03:48----------
out and people were competing to be the

---------03:50----------
first to offer screen repairs on it this

---------03:52----------
one company was buying the screens for a

---------03:54----------
thing of you know two hundred five or

---------03:56----------
$249 an offering screen repair for 300

---------03:59----------
why it's just this big dick contest that

---------04:03----------
makes no sense I'm not gonna buy a

---------04:04----------
screen for $200 so that I have to offer

---------04:07----------
a 250 or $300 screen repair to the

---------04:09----------
customer which is think it's gonna make

---------04:11----------
it's gonna make them tell me to go F

---------04:12----------
myself there's no point in that it's

---------04:14----------
complete and utter waste I'd rather just

---------04:16----------
I don't have it you know for the 16 inch

---------04:21----------
MacBook I don't expect to be able to get

---------04:22----------
screens for that until 2021 I don't

---------04:25----------
expect the schematic or board view to be

---------04:27----------
out for that machine until at least 2021

---------04:34----------
that's the business not to fix just out

---------04:38----------
of interest well in order to get that

---------04:41----------
machine to open it out of interest

---------04:42----------
rather than to fix I would have to

---------04:43----------
purchase one for three thousand dollars

---------04:45----------
from the Apple Store do I look like

---------04:47----------
someone that has such interest in Apple

---------04:49----------
products that when they come out I spent

---------04:50----------
three thousand dollars to open them

---------04:51----------
because Apple products interest me that

---------04:53----------
much really yeah I love Apple product so

---------05:03----------
much that I spent three thousand dollars

---------05:04----------
out of pocket just though just just for

---------05:06----------
the privilege of opening it that's not

---------05:11----------
happening yes sir we're close to ready

---------05:15----------
to get this thing out of here okay now

---------05:20----------
the charge port is I like to keep it

---------05:23----------
screwed into the motherboard itself for

---------05:25----------
a good reason the charge ports come out

---------05:29----------
of the board really easy it's not the

---------05:31----------
old ones where they slide in it's the

---------05:32----------
stupid FPC snapping connectors and the

---------05:35----------
cable itself is very very rigid and the

---------05:39----------
charging cables are very rigid so they

---------05:41----------
come off really easy I'm an apple

---------05:43----------
sheepses Rockford no you're not don't

---------05:45----------
say that don't be a sheep for anybody so

---------05:51----------
to keep me saying I like to have the

---------05:53----------
charge port extrude into the board when

---------05:57----------
I work on it so when I take the board

---------05:58----------
out the charge port is screwed onto the

---------06:01----------
board makes life easy for me

---------06:02----------
so now we can take the Machine take all

---------06:05----------
these little screws I can take these

---------06:09----------
screws and put them in a bag

---------06:14----------
all these stupid little metal covers and

---------06:17----------
plastic covers and other junk so that it

---------06:20----------
doesn't get lost goes here the machine

---------06:22----------
goes off my desk we just keep the board

---------06:24----------
by itself and let's get to work and do

---------06:29----------
our job so we plug it in again and we're

---------06:33----------
gonna do some basic basic measurements

---------06:35----------
nothing crazy so the first thing that we

---------06:39----------
measure for I want to see if we're

---------06:42----------
getting people through the three

---------06:43----------
underscore g3 Hut where is my tip a 303

---------06:48----------
underscore g3 huh

---------06:51----------
that's the rail that's going to power

---------06:53----------
these chips called CD 32 15s now the CD

---------06:57----------
32 15 is a chip that speaks to the

---------07:00----------
charger and requests 20 volts from the

---------07:03----------
charger these chips are powered by pp

---------07:06----------
3v3 underscore g3 huh so if that power

---------07:07----------
rail is not there I'm not going to get a

---------07:10----------
green light I mean I'm not going to get

---------07:12----------
20 volts in the charger same same

---------07:15----------
concept that's the rather that's the

---------07:18----------
show up first so we're gonna look at the

---------07:20----------
board right here this is a CD 32 15 b 33

---------07:26----------
underscore g3 hot should be available on

---------07:28----------
one of those caps right by it right

---------07:30----------
there so let's take a look and oh this

---------07:34----------
is interesting

---------07:36----------
mmm doesn't look very nice down there

---------07:40----------
doesn't look very nice down there it

---------07:45----------
does not look very nice down there at

---------07:46----------
all sounds like half of my dates from

---------07:53----------
the end of 2018 okay so it's plugged in

---------07:57----------
and on pp3 v3 underscore g3 hot we get

---------08:08----------
27 millivolts and I can't tell if this

---------08:12----------
is corrosion or dirt it's really hard to

---------08:15----------
tell actually is this corrosion a dirt

---------08:24----------
thang is this corrosion or dirt or just

---------08:31----------
under-filled stuff is this cap very

---------08:34----------
commonly corrodes liquid loves to get in

---------08:36----------
this little corner this hall sensor I

---------08:40----------
don't know is that just Apple quality

---------08:42----------
solder joints or is this cuz here's the

---------08:44----------
thing uh when I see stuff like this it

---------08:46----------
looks like it could have been corroded

---------08:49----------
I'm you may think it's corrosion and I

---------08:53----------
would wonder was the green stuff well

---------08:55----------
there's no green stuff so that would

---------08:56----------
mean it was cleaned but if it was

---------08:57----------
cleaned it wouldn't be this dusty now

---------08:59----------
perhaps somebody it got corroded then it

---------09:01----------
was cleaned and then that same person

---------09:03----------
that had the wherewithal to clean their

---------09:05----------
machine got all this dust in and again I

---------09:08----------
don't believe what was the most stupid

---------09:09----------
scum customers I don't mean to be rude I

---------09:11----------
don't have the ability to answer that I

---------09:13----------
forget the experience the moment they

---------09:14----------
walk out of the store I'm serious I when

---------09:16----------
I have an aggravating customer

---------09:17----------
experience the way that I maintain my

---------09:19----------
sanity is I just don't remember it now

---------09:22----------
if Steve says you remember this his

---------09:23----------
thing and he starts to tell the story I

---------09:25----------
remember it then I'll remember it but if

---------09:27----------
but at the moment I'm done dealing with

---------09:30----------
a jackass on the phone or here it just

---------09:32----------
it leaves my mind I don't let it you

---------09:33----------
know I don't let it take up space in my

---------09:35----------
head because if I did I would lose my

---------09:37----------
mind and I wouldn't be able to get

---------09:38----------
anything done and I would hate the world

---------09:40----------
and hate humanity and the only way you

---------09:41----------
can really say in a service business for

---------09:43----------
a long time is if you retain the you

---------09:46----------
retain the good experiences but you just

---------09:47----------
forget the bad ones I forget most of

---------09:49----------
them to be honest with you

---------09:51----------
so this is so let's just see if there

---------09:55----------
why it is we're missing pp3 v3

---------09:57----------
underscore g3 hot so let's go to the

---------09:59----------
chip that makes it this is going to be

---------10:02----------
the circuit that creates pp3 v3

---------10:05----------
underscore g3 hut let's get that under

---------10:08----------
the microscope here

---------10:11----------
[Music]

---------10:13----------
you know this chip okay

---------10:17----------
so the first thing we want to do see if

---------10:20----------
it's being told to make that power round

---------10:22----------
so we have it over here well you have a

---------10:24----------
bunch of different things on this chip

---------10:26----------
and it says over here PM e NP 3v3 g3 hot

---------10:31----------
en is gonna stand for enable hopefully

---------10:35----------
you can see that there you go enable e n

---------10:38----------
right there so let's see what we get on

---------10:40----------
pin 10 alright see you forgot our enable

---------10:44----------
it's gonna be the pen that's up here

---------10:56----------
0.03 millivolts isn't that great

---------10:59----------
alright see where that enable comes from

---------11:01----------
me going the schematic in the board view

---------11:02----------
will use Paul Daniels his lovely

---------11:04----------
software to right-click on that enable

---------11:05----------
and see that it comes from you 7,000 u

---------11:13----------
7,000 as an IAS l9 2 3 9 similar to what

---------11:16----------
the ISL 9 2 6 2 5 9 used to do on the

---------11:19----------
older model MacBooks let's take a look

---------11:21----------
at that ship and see what it looks like

---------11:24----------
also very clean hmm let's see what

---------11:28----------
happens if we re hot that ship doesn't

---------11:33----------
we can always try replacing it

---------11:51----------
Christian said 10/10 would if I were a

---------11:53----------
girl

---------12:01----------
that's reassuring all right

---------12:10----------
let's give that chip summary hotting

---------12:12----------
action

---------13:10----------
okay plug it in five volts 10 milliamps

---------13:15----------
that is Oh nine two three nine is bad we

---------13:18----------
need to replace it with a new one and

---------13:19----------
where we can we get a new chip stored

---------13:22----------
out Rossmann group.com okay we're gonna

---------13:25----------
get rid of that ship and have to be get

---------13:27----------
rid of that chip we're gonna put on a

---------13:28----------
nice new one from store dot austin group

---------13:33----------
calm

---------13:44----------
when you rent you're paying the property

---------13:46----------
taxes anyway I don't pay property tax I

---------13:50----------
pay rent now maybe what you mean to say

---------13:52----------
is that the the issue of property tax is

---------13:56----------
included in my rent but I have looked at

---------13:58----------
a lot of places and even the ones that

---------14:00----------
are even you know a quarter of the way

---------14:02----------
decent even the stuff that's a barely

---------14:06----------
yeah

---------14:07----------
they you're still paying a ridiculous

---------14:10----------
amount of money like I paid two thousand

---------14:14----------
bucks a month and I have 1,100 1,100

---------14:17----------
square foot apartment and it takes me 11

---------14:19----------
minutes to get to work in Manhattan

---------14:20----------
which is a ridiculously good commute I'm

---------14:23----------
spoiled there with a commute but I'm

---------14:25----------
very spoiled with my commute how many

---------14:28----------
people that pay 2,000 a month for 1,100

---------14:30----------
square feet have a 11 minute commute

---------14:32----------
into Manhattan but if I wanted to buy a

---------14:37----------
house I would be looking at spending

---------14:41----------
let's say I got a $600,000 house I'd go

---------14:44----------
to a 40-minute commute I'd have a 10 to

---------14:47----------
20 thousand dollar property tax and I'd

---------14:49----------
probably have a shitty air-conditioned

---------14:51----------
space than I have now it just it doesn't

---------14:53----------
make sense at all

---------15:04----------
depends on the home that you get ping

---------15:05----------
Sinha there are places you can get with

---------15:10----------
the property taxes only around 10,000

---------15:12----------
but you're you're really scraping the

---------15:15----------
bottom of the barrel there those those

---------15:17----------
that those places are gonna be gutter

---------15:18----------
trash and you're going to be spending

---------15:20----------
one or two thousand dollars in your

---------15:21----------
mortgage for it after putting a down

---------15:22----------
payment at which point you're paying as

---------15:24----------
much as I do now and just doesn't make

---------15:26----------
any damn bit of sense so

---------16:22----------
Oh keys

---------16:26----------
jeez

---------16:29----------
oh come on no no no no no for the last

---------16:37----------
time no no no no no no no no no we have

---------16:49----------
this an O button here and every time you

---------16:51----------
hit it it says no in different ways

---------16:59----------
channeling it right now

---------17:03----------
no no no no no no I mean by the last

---------17:17----------
time yeah I don't know if that's a piece

---------17:23----------
of the last chip that broke off when I

---------17:25----------
removed it or a piece of the last trip

---------17:27----------
that broke off when that chip itself

---------17:28----------
broke but you could see these these

---------17:31----------
glass looking chips are ridiculously

---------17:33----------
delicate and on the end of my exacto

---------17:35----------
knife there's actually a piece of what I

---------17:37----------
believe is the old chip the last time no

---------17:48----------
all right six hundred milliamps that

---------17:50----------
means that we're getting a different

---------17:52----------
response than before which is great but

---------17:56----------
it never goes 220 volts also six hundred

---------17:58----------
milliamps is way more than 200 that's

---------18:02----------
strange

---------18:04----------
that's actually very strange that

---------18:06----------
doesn't make sense this this is no good

---------18:10----------
okay what the f

---------18:15----------
someone said chip is upside down is it

---------18:19----------
no way no no Oh son of a

---------18:37----------
that's it excellent dad that's a quality

---------18:39----------
troll right there he waited until after

---------18:41----------
I powered it on to do that that's that's

---------18:45----------
11 start rolling right there when the

---------18:48----------
chip is on the board say it's upside now

---------18:50----------
so I put the the old chip on my mat and

---------18:53----------
I put the old chip on my mat upside down

---------18:55----------
apparently

---------19:06----------
luckily how much damage could you

---------19:09----------
possibly do at 5 volts I'm fine I'm fine

---------19:16----------
we tried to tell you you just said it

---------19:19----------
now you're all talking about property

---------19:22----------
taxes before it is that you just wanted

---------19:28----------
to see something smoke let's be honest

---------19:30----------
that's fine I understand it

---------20:03----------
all right be right back and get my grab

---------20:07----------
another one

---------20:07----------
[Music]

---------20:34----------
yeah

---------20:44----------
thank you Lord Haven thank you very much

---------20:47----------
I hope you have a happy holiday filled

---------20:53----------
with honest contractors and the void of

---------20:59----------
property taxes and Karan's and real

---------21:03----------
estate brokers

---------21:21----------
hmm rapid cool technology

---------21:30----------
all right I have a good feeling about

---------21:32----------
this when the chip was on upside down it

---------21:35----------
took 600 ml lamps I only needed to take

---------21:37----------
200 milliamps anything's better than

---------21:39----------
what it was taking before you piece of

---------21:46----------
 we're literally right where

---------21:51----------
we started Tenma lamps if we are handy

---------21:56----------
email Dan at Rosslyn Group calm and ask

---------21:59----------
him why we're out of stuff when he's the

---------22:00----------
inventory man we should be out of

---------22:03----------
nothing ever okay so let's see is this

---------22:06----------
still wait really we're still missing it

---------22:10----------
enable nice dodge okay we have five

---------22:16----------
volts wait so if we have five volts

---------22:19----------
there do we have PP 3v3 no where is P P

---------22:23----------
3 P 3 that's

---------22:35----------
now 20 volts so this is uh this this

---------22:39----------
dream is a troll nothing is

---------22:42----------
gonna work for me this evening is it you

---------22:45----------
effing piece of okay let's see so

---------22:48----------
over here we have five volts on the

---------22:53----------
enable for pp3 v3 underscore g3 odd

---------22:55----------
alright let's go over this like an

---------22:58----------
infant to do this very quickly because I

---------23:05----------
want to get the out of here and get

---------23:07----------
some food

---------23:08----------
all I had today was a Westville sandwich

---------23:10----------
and some frozen and I could use

---------23:13----------
some food so de6 902 what do we have

---------23:17----------
here on the output what's on output 5

---------23:22----------
volts or 5 volts would definitely be

---------23:24----------
going into my chip all right what do we

---------23:27----------
have over here on Ehlo 6900 or are 6915

---------23:31----------
let's see we got there

---------23:45----------
0.03 0.05 all right that's enough that I

---------23:48----------
think I may actually have a short and

---------23:53----------
look at that 1.8 ohm short and I know

---------23:56----------
exactly what the is shorted it's a

---------23:58----------
little piece of from before that

---------23:59----------
always dies right by the NAND oh I

---------24:02----------
should have tweezed you off and I had

---------24:04----------
the chance you bastard

---------24:05----------
it's you it's you you despicable piece

---------24:08----------
of but

---------24:19----------
rip yeah you little you and

---------24:24----------
 your family every damn time and now

---------24:31----------
every damn time alright so this is

---------24:37----------
interesting we had two problems with

---------24:38----------
this board the first problem is that our

---------24:39----------
ISL 9039 have went bad and the second is

---------24:42----------
that little cap that likes to hide right

---------24:45----------
underneath this shield for the NAND also

---------24:48----------
died that cap is a very common culprit

---------24:50----------
to cause PP 3v3 underscore g3 han-sik

---------24:53----------
can become a short-circuited very common

---------24:55----------
on the a2 0-0 0 to 3 9 motherboard and I

---------24:58----------
want to point it out because you may

---------24:59----------
actually miss this in the thermal camera

---------25:00----------
you see this piece of metal even if you

---------25:03----------
have a thermal camera the thermal camera

---------25:05----------
is going to reflect a lot of anything

---------25:08----------
that's metal and the capacitor over here

---------25:10----------
is going to get hot but you're not going

---------25:11----------
to think that it's bad because you're

---------25:13----------
gonna have this metal piece over here

---------25:14----------
and this metal piece over here is going

---------25:16----------
to be in the way so you won't see it and

---------25:18----------
you may if you use the thermal camera as

---------25:19----------
your main means of finding the short

---------25:21----------
you're not gonna get it so now that PP

---------25:23----------
3v3 underscore g3 honson no longer

---------25:24----------
shorted this chip over here is gonna be

---------25:27----------
allowed to speak to the charger and

---------25:28----------
negotiate 20 volts with it and then it's

---------25:29----------
gonna be able to get the power it needs

---------25:31----------
to power the system because number 5

---------25:33----------
volts is not good enough 5 volts is for

---------25:35----------
charging a cell phone 5 volts is for

---------25:37----------
charging a GoPro that's not gonna do

---------25:38----------
anything but that's what it puts out

---------25:40----------
initially just because this is a

---------25:42----------
charging protocol that works with many

---------25:44----------
different things if you send five volts

---------25:46----------
something expecting 20 nothing bad is

---------25:48----------
gonna happen if you send 20 volts

---------25:49----------
something expecting five something

---------25:51----------
terrible is gonna happen so it obviously

---------25:53----------
it's gonna start at the lowest common

---------25:54----------
denominator which is 5 volts because

---------25:56----------
that is something that that's not going

---------25:58----------
to blow up everything else once you got

---------26:00----------
5 volts it's going to allow the system

---------26:03----------
to create a rail called peepees review 3

---------26:04----------
underscore g3 hot and that rail is going

---------26:07----------
to power this chip over here see where

---------26:09----------
it says VN 3.3 volts that's going to

---------26:11----------
power this trip which is a USB C port

---------26:13----------
controller and that USB C port

---------26:15----------
controller is going to speak to the

---------26:17----------
charger so if we go to the other side of

---------26:19----------
the machine over here you'll see that

---------26:21----------
this is where the charge port plugs in

---------26:23----------
see if I look at you on the desk see

---------26:25----------
this right here this is the charge port

---------26:27----------
this is where it plugs in this is the

---------26:29----------
charge port right where it plugs in that

---------26:31----------
connector

---------26:32----------
if we click right over here you'll see

---------26:34----------
BAM speaks of the chip so the charger is

---------26:37----------
gonna speak to the Machine via the CD

---------26:41----------
3215 USB C port control and that chip

---------26:43----------
needs to be turning on in order for this

---------26:44----------
system to work which means people here M

---------26:45----------
squared you throughout must be present

---------26:46----------
which means it must be getting enabled

---------26:47----------
by the u 7008 K is all 93 nine which

---------26:50----------
also makes me 300 G Fiat must be present

---------26:52----------
as well as not being short-circuited to

---------26:54----------
ground which means taking off the little

---------26:55----------
cap right by the NAND on the bottom of

---------26:57----------
the CD 32 15 is it on the right side and

---------26:58----------
then the system works again you have a

---------27:01----------
working macbook and happy customer some

---------27:04----------
money in your pocket that's it for today

---------27:05----------
as always I hope you learned something

---------27:07----------
see you in the next video bye
