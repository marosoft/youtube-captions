---------00:00----------
all right so today I'm going to be going

---------00:01----------
over an eight to zero 29:36 that after a

---------00:04----------
liquid spill was not seeing the battery

---------00:06----------
and I've traced it down to the SMC if

---------00:08----------
you want to learn a little bit more

---------00:10----------
about how I do troubleshooting when you

---------00:12----------
cannot see the battery I have an entire

---------00:13----------
video on this channel dedicated to

---------00:15----------
battery recognition and battery charging

---------00:17----------
issues I'd highly suggest you watch that

---------00:19----------
what I'm going to be doing today is I'm

---------00:21----------
going to be showcasing a new product

---------00:22----------
that I'm going to be selling which is an

---------00:24----------
mtech solder paste so up until now very

---------00:28----------
often if you wanted to buy this stuff

---------00:30----------
you would have to buy this big tub I

---------00:32----------
tried to convince them to put it into

---------00:34----------
these these things here these are just a

---------00:37----------
basic little 35 gram syringes and we're

---------00:42----------
going to be using this instead of my

---------00:43----------
standard old solder paste that I usually

---------00:45----------
use which was this is this Custer crap

---------00:48----------
here I shouldn't say crap because Custer

---------00:49----------
makes good stuff it's just it's it's

---------00:51----------
good stuff it really is but this is

---------00:54----------
better and the thing is you can't get

---------00:56----------
this on Amazon but you can get this on

---------00:57----------
Amazon so I've just kind of been

---------00:58----------
cheeping out and buying this stuff

---------01:00----------
because it was just easy but it's good

---------01:03----------
just it don't work the same so we're

---------01:05----------
going to go over replacing the SMC on

---------01:06----------
this board which is one of my least

---------01:08----------
favorite jobs to do and particularly

---------01:10----------
because again I don't know if the SMC

---------01:12----------
I'm taking off of the donor board works

---------01:14----------
and above all the most fun part here is

---------01:16----------
that I don't have the proper stencil and

---------01:18----------
the great part about the consumer

---------01:19----------
electronics business is of course you

---------01:21----------
know you can't buy parts for any of this

---------01:22----------
stuff it's all you know stolen

---------01:24----------
non-supported blah blah blah and a

---------01:26----------
little stencil that I knew is from China

---------01:28----------
if I order the stencil by the time it

---------01:29----------
gets here the customer will long have

---------01:31----------
since filed

---------01:32----------
you know the one-star yelp review in

---------01:33----------
screens about thrown around and all that

---------01:35----------
stuff so I need to make do it the one

---------01:37----------
that I have and pray that after I'm done

---------01:39----------
with this repair I remember to purchase

---------01:41----------
the proper stencil so let's go over

---------01:43----------
replacing this smc and we're going to

---------01:46----------
take the SMC off of a donor board which

---------01:47----------
again I have no idea if this boy is good

---------01:50----------
I have no idea of the SMC on here is

---------01:52----------
good but that's what we do here when we

---------01:54----------
try to repair products that with no

---------01:56----------
support from the manufacturer so I'm

---------01:58----------
going to turn on my air filter here and

---------02:01----------
let's get started so first things first

---------02:04----------
is removing the old SMC so this is going

---------02:07----------
to be the old SMC

---------02:08----------
over here let's just get you in the

---------02:12----------
microscope so you can see what I'm

---------02:13----------
looking at we're going to turn on my JB

---------02:16----------
cjt a which is going to take this off

---------02:18----------
with quickness so first things first is

---------02:21----------
to get some flux under it it'll make

---------02:23----------
removing the old SMC a little bit easier

---------02:26----------
and the more you make a miserable job

---------02:28----------
easier the better life will be for

---------02:31----------
everybody involved so I guess you know

---------02:35----------
yeah it's some flux there I saw my mean

---------02:40----------
a fuckton get my air filter positioned

---------02:43----------
right behind the microscope so check

---------02:44----------
this out see how air filter board air

---------02:48----------
filter board no breathing of this ship

---------02:50----------
and we get the JBC JTA on gonna put my

---------02:54----------
air up a little bit here I'm going to my

---------02:56----------
air a little higher than usual 81%

---------02:58----------
because this is a big chip and off we go

---------03:05----------
we're going to start from further away

---------03:07----------
now remember the if the board is cold

---------03:09----------
even as I'm heating the chip in the pads

---------03:11----------
the board is going to absorb that heat

---------03:13----------
and take it away so the chip is going to

---------03:15----------
be getting burned and the chip is still

---------03:18----------
not going to come off the board so you

---------03:20----------
kind of want to preheat it you'll be

---------03:21----------
able to tell if you've preheated it

---------03:23----------
because the flux is going to slowly flow

---------03:26----------
away so I have a flux and I'm getting

---------03:30----------
under my chip and getting under my chip

---------03:32----------
which is great but then eventually it'll

---------03:35----------
be a little very small puddle of it

---------03:37----------
around the chip and that's how we'll

---------03:39----------
know that I'm ready to take off my my

---------03:41----------
SMC

---------03:48----------
now I know this JBC is powerful enough

---------03:50----------
to take this thing off and damn near 15

---------03:52----------
seconds but I'm not I don't want to rape

---------03:54----------
the board like that I don't want to pull

---------03:57----------
a wild pcs ISM and you know run up on

---------04:00----------
 with a Wagner heat gun

---------04:03----------
why do pcs like that plays I don't know

---------04:06----------
how they sleep at night like I

---------04:08----------
really I get messages almost every week

---------04:10----------
from people who went there and I truly

---------04:13----------
honestly do not understand how the

---------04:15----------
they sleep at night

---------04:16----------
like they teach people how to destroy

---------04:18----------
things and that's their that's their

---------04:20----------
business model like it's here's how to

---------04:25----------
 up but there was one person

---------04:28----------
actually quoted there as saying and I'm

---------04:29----------
not kidding I'm not I'm not making this

---------04:31----------
 up you know if a motherboard needs

---------04:33----------
a jumper wire it's not fixable like you

---------04:37----------
know re are you kidding me I

---------04:40----------
mean do you know how much money I have

---------04:42----------
made off of this do you know how many

---------04:44----------
like you know many care how many cases

---------04:48----------
of wellness core not the regular lowness

---------04:51----------
but the Wellness court cat food was paid

---------04:52----------
for off of this I mean just that alone

---------04:56----------
not parts not anything else that's

---------04:58----------
really those people are some of the most

---------05:00----------
ignorant in the consumer

---------05:02----------
electronics repair business just make

---------05:06----------
sure as many people as you know know and

---------05:08----------
again even if you don't have the money

---------05:10----------
to learn you know people like myself and

---------05:13----------
Jessa we put a lot of even iFixit vien

---------05:15----------
not ifixit.com the i fix at the end like

---------05:18----------
they put out a lot of free content that

---------05:20----------
you can use if you have no money

---------05:22----------
available to learn this stuff we put out

---------05:24----------
a lot of content that shows exactly what

---------05:26----------
type of tools you need what you need to

---------05:28----------
do with the diagnostic processes are so

---------05:30----------
don't we we offer paid tutoring as well

---------05:32----------
but there's a lot of free resources out

---------05:34----------
there that well it's not hands-on where

---------05:36----------
you're actually you know working on

---------05:38----------
stuff it's the stuff that we're showing

---------05:40----------
you is stuff that actually works it's

---------05:42----------
not like that baku

---------05:45----------
rework station or using wagner heat gun

---------05:47----------
on a motherboard that so what i'm doing

---------05:49----------
here is i'm just going to remove the old

---------05:51----------
leaded lead free solder because that's

---------05:52----------
going to be a little harder to wick i

---------05:54----------
also want to take a little bit of a look

---------05:56----------
over at this probe point over here

---------05:59----------
cause you know that doesn't look as nice

---------06:00----------
as I'd like it to and I'd like to make

---------06:02----------
it look as nice as I can for all I know

---------06:04----------
that's why this I'm not gonna look on

---------06:06----------
the board view to see if that's why it

---------06:07----------
doesn't recognize a battery for all I

---------06:09----------
know that's something totally unrelated

---------06:10----------
but it's just good to remove every sign

---------06:13----------
of liquid damage that you see when

---------06:14----------
you're working on one of these boards

---------06:16----------
that's what I so before you even get to

---------06:19----------
using your brain and using the schematic

---------06:22----------
it's a good habit to get into to just

---------06:24----------
you know try to remove all the traces

---------06:27----------
that liquid was there if you're doing

---------06:28----------
that then things will go well for you so

---------06:31----------
let's all right so we're in focus so now

---------06:35----------
that I have leaded solder on there I'm

---------06:38----------
going to use this this beveled tip that

---------06:41----------
I have from hackle and this tip is going

---------06:43----------
to make it nice and easy for me to

---------06:45----------
remove all this old solder I don't reuse

---------06:47----------
the old balls there there are some

---------06:49----------
people that say you know remove it with

---------06:51----------
flux and then try to solder that SM C on

---------06:53----------
top of there and and I don't have the

---------06:57----------
life of luck required to make like

---------06:59----------
that work like I've done it and it's

---------07:02----------
work but then I've done it in the

---------07:03----------
hazards in any if I feel kind of stupid

---------07:05----------
having to do it again so all right so we

---------07:10----------
got this done now the next step up ahead

---------07:14----------
is going to be I'm going to clean the

---------07:15----------
board of all that old and we're

---------07:18----------
going to put the board aside because

---------07:19----------
after this we're not going to be doing

---------07:20----------
work on the board we're going to be

---------07:21----------
doing work putting little balls on our

---------07:23----------
SMC so I have my clean room wiper and my

---------07:28----------
99% alcohol I folded the clean room

---------07:31----------
wiper but I'm not using a clean room

---------07:32----------
wiper by itself I folded it about four

---------07:34----------
or five times over this if I want

---------07:36----------
flux getting on my hands you don't want

---------07:38----------
to stop any of these chemicals like the

---------07:40----------
branson you see or any of that you

---------07:41----------
don't want any a lot of what we work

---------07:42----------
with you get on your skin you know in an

---------07:44----------
ideal world I actually get up and use

---------07:46----------
those nitrile gloves right now but I'm

---------07:48----------
not because I'm setting a bad example

---------07:50----------
please don't do what I'm doing

---------07:53----------
okay so we're going to move that aside

---------07:55----------
now we're going to take the SMC off of

---------07:57----------
the donor board please tell the board

---------08:01----------
that I need to fix oh you have no idea

---------08:03----------
how many times the donor boards I get

---------08:05----------
look worse than the board I need

---------08:06----------
to fix it it's such this one

---------08:11----------
it's more important for me to have flux

---------08:13----------
on there because I actually want this to

---------08:15----------
come off without ripping pads without

---------08:17----------
destroying the SMC so this one I'm going

---------08:21----------
to preheat for a bit starting up the JBC

---------08:26----------
okay let's get started here so I'm just

---------08:33----------
going to preheat the board

---------08:34----------
[Music]

---------09:12----------
all right so now I feel like it's okay

---------09:14----------
for me to start getting a little bit

---------09:16----------
closer help this new capture hardware is

---------09:20----------
doing its job got a new card that allows

---------09:23----------
me to record without any kind of funky

---------09:26----------
stuff happening in the color space and I

---------09:28----------
also took this as an opportunity to

---------09:29----------
start capturing in 42 - okay SMC is off

---------09:33----------
looks like it was a clean grab good

---------09:36----------
stuff good stuff now we have to clean

---------09:41----------
this little pile of so we're going

---------09:44----------
to put the chip in my in my chip holder

---------09:48----------
yeah

---------09:49----------
ask David Ritchie's at advance three

---------09:51----------
works where to get this thing from

---------09:52----------
because I have no idea where the he

---------09:54----------
gets them from I bought mine from him

---------09:56----------
and I got some solder blob stuck in

---------09:59----------
there and some flux which is why this

---------10:00----------
thing is not moving nicely I really

---------10:03----------
should take better care of my equipment

---------10:05----------
sometimes yeah oh this looks gross that

---------10:08----------
is you ever see this video by a frank

---------10:12----------
about marsupials this kind of looks like

---------10:15----------
the inside of the pouch that he shows in

---------10:16----------
the video oh this makes me sick oh yeah

---------10:24----------
I'm deaf I definitely have to maintain

---------10:25----------
this thing better that's gross let's

---------10:28----------
focus on something else while I'm

---------10:29----------
putting the chicken okay yeah David

---------10:35----------
Ritchie's at advanced 3 Works has a lot

---------10:38----------
of these little things that I don't

---------10:39----------
really know where to get and I don't

---------10:41----------
feel like hunting them down so it's

---------10:44----------
worth paying the middleman for you to

---------10:45----------
just be able to say hi I have this board

---------10:47----------
and I need a little thingy to hold it do

---------10:49----------
you know what I mean and he goes yes and

---------10:51----------
then he sends me a PayPal invoice and

---------10:54----------
then I pay it and then he sends it to me

---------10:56----------
and then life is life is peachy bag but

---------11:02----------
no way I get this directly oh what a

---------11:05----------
pain a middleman you can waste your own

---------11:08----------
 time you feel me like I want to

---------11:12----------
spend my I don't even want to spend time

---------11:13----------
fixing boards necessarily I kind of want

---------11:15----------
to spend time telling you somebody else

---------11:17----------
what's wrong with them to fix them so

---------11:18----------
that I can go do other stuff but I sure

---------11:20----------
as do not want to spend time

---------11:22----------
hunting

---------11:23----------
 down in China like let know let

---------11:26----------
that go to somebody who's who wants to

---------11:28----------
be an expert in that you know all right

---------11:31----------
same same concept here let's get rid of

---------11:33----------
all the lead free and it's going to make

---------11:36----------
it a little easier to wick it take my

---------11:39----------
wick I have the wick here yeah I feel

---------11:43----------
like this looks better than my old

---------11:44----------
capture setup it was worth it I'm

---------11:46----------
spending like another six or seven

---------11:47----------
hundred bucks on cards which is just so

---------11:49----------
I could get dumped the mage well dongles

---------11:51----------
and either black magic and a star tech

---------11:53----------
one but there's no color space

---------11:54----------
conversion I don't know what it is like

---------11:56----------
I mean I know that there's absolutely

---------11:57----------
nothing I'm doing here there's nothing

---------11:59----------
I'm doing here that would actually be

---------12:00----------
benefited by like by color space

---------12:02----------
differences it's just I saw it and it

---------12:05----------
just one day I saw that the camera

---------12:07----------
looked different when it was plugged

---------12:08----------
directly into the monitor than it did

---------12:09----------
being captured and then into the monitor

---------12:10----------
even when I was recording a raw video

---------12:12----------
feed and that that just seems that did

---------12:17----------
not seem right and it just I don't know

---------12:20----------
there's a little part of me that it's ly

---------12:21----------
demands perfection and these things that

---------12:23----------
don't actually matter that I and I've

---------12:27----------
probably wasted a lot of money in life

---------12:28----------
giving a crap about things that don't

---------12:30----------
matter like how something

---------12:33----------
handles a 42 color source from this

---------12:36----------
camera hello space video from this

---------12:38----------
family yeah

---------12:47----------
sexy isn't all right so now what I'm

---------12:49----------
going to do is I'm going to take the

---------12:50----------
wrong stencil cuz I don't have the right

---------12:54----------
one oh god this is a dirty stencil jeez

---------13:01----------
I need ya I got spoiled because most of

---------13:04----------
the SMC's I've been replacing have

---------13:05----------
actually been from this guy on ebay

---------13:06----------
that's been selling them with the balls

---------13:08----------
attached and likey you bet your ass if

---------13:11----------
somebody's going to sell this stuff with

---------13:12----------
balls attached that I am NOT going to

---------13:14----------
 around with attaching balls to

---------13:15----------
stuff I'd still be cleaning this the

---------13:18----------
flux and the balls is very simple I just

---------13:20----------
put the highest temperature the highest

---------13:21----------
AR on my station I blow all this crap

---------13:24----------
away and then a little wiper with

---------13:27----------
alcohol

---------13:36----------
cleans off all the nasty stuff

---------13:45----------
[Music]

---------13:46----------
well while it's still hot and boiling

---------13:47----------
after that you can toss it in the

---------13:48----------
ultrasonic cleaner if your ultrasonic is

---------13:51----------
on and hot at the time now this is the

---------13:56----------
wrong the wrong extent so I'm going to

---------13:59----------
have some extra balls somewhere

---------14:16----------
like figuring out the problem can be fun

---------14:18----------
but this is really just manual labor

---------14:20----------
that is then there's ultimately no fun

---------14:22----------
to it for me and I got it still clean

---------14:28----------
out this yeah come on

---------14:35----------
let's do this again this is about as

---------14:37----------
clean as I'm getting this old POS so

---------14:39----------
what I'm going to do here is I'm just

---------14:41----------
going to tape it down onto them onto the

---------14:43----------
SMC area now I don't place the stencil

---------14:47----------
and then put the and then put the tape

---------14:49----------
down because that doesn't that that's

---------14:51----------
just a bad idea because it's going to

---------14:53----------
move around so I put the tape on the

---------14:55----------
stencil and then I move it to

---------14:57----------
approximately where I want it to be

---------14:59----------
I'm not going to tape it down incredibly

---------15:01----------
hard I saved the taping it down

---------15:02----------
incredibly hard to the end because I may

---------15:04----------
want to move it as I go I do my best to

---------15:06----------
not touch any of the disgusting flux

---------15:08----------
that's left over on this clamp and they

---------15:11----------
fail

---------15:37----------
[Music]

---------15:50----------
all right so this is all going to be

---------15:52----------
taped down push down show you're nice

---------15:56----------
and push down there all right now what

---------15:59----------
we do is you're going to take some

---------16:00----------
solder paste and we're going to put it

---------16:01----------
across all this stuff

---------16:03----------
so here's solder paste and whoa hey

---------16:06----------
there's something in there oh I didn't

---------16:10----------
clean it all the way mother mother

---------16:15----------
flower

---------16:20----------
mother flower get out of there yeah

---------16:32----------
you

---------16:42----------
okay

---------16:43----------
now take two we're going to put my

---------16:48----------
solder paste in there

---------16:54----------
this little syringe thingy is not

---------16:56----------
included and I would love to tell you

---------16:58----------
where to buy the extra piece there's an

---------17:00----------
extra fine needle for the syringe and I

---------17:01----------
have no idea where it comes from

---------17:03----------
somebody actually sent me these as a

---------17:06----------
gift and I'm on my last one right here

---------17:08----------
so when I'm out of it I'll have no idea

---------17:10----------
where to get this it just it's a little

---------17:12----------
you know see this is the end of the

---------17:14----------
syringe and then it has this long fine

---------17:17----------
needle that goes on to it and I have no

---------17:20----------
idea where you get this from you know I

---------17:23----------
mean it's one of those things were like

---------17:25----------
I don't know what the tube is because

---------17:26----------
the tube doesn't say on it any like type

---------17:28----------
of standard I'm not familiar with it

---------17:30----------
because I'm just a lowly you know

---------17:33----------
electronics tech I'm not like a you know

---------17:35----------
 college graduate worked at large

---------17:38----------
corporation ordering standardized

---------17:41----------
materials person so I have no idea what

---------17:44----------
this is I would be totally willing to

---------17:46----------
pay for it but I look up syringe thing

---------17:48----------
and I'm gonna find you a bunch of them

---------17:50----------
and if I know if what I buy is

---------17:51----------
actually going to fit how do you know

---------17:54----------
when you're buying stuff on the internet

---------17:56----------
that it fits your little syringe thing

---------17:57----------
how do you ask for help on these matters

---------17:59----------
how do you tell somebody hi I have this

---------18:02----------
type of syringe thing do you have a

---------18:03----------
needle thing that fits my syringe thing

---------18:06----------
one of those it's one of those like

---------18:08----------
where I know what I want I just have no

---------18:10----------
 clue how to get I should

---------18:12----------
probably put 10 or 20 minutes of time

---------18:14----------
into figuring that out someday but

---------18:15----------
instead I will put that time into

---------18:16----------
editing a YouTube video because well

---------18:19----------
this is just kind of more fun

---------18:25----------
teaching you guys how to do this stuff

---------18:27----------
is far more productive in my opinion

---------18:29----------
than then getting them you know getting

---------18:33----------
another set of syringe tips plus that's

---------18:37----------
boring anyway alright so we're in there

---------18:40----------
I think we're good to go now I'm going

---------18:44----------
to turn the air way down on the JBC

---------18:46----------
hot-air station the air cannot be high

---------18:49----------
when you're doing this because then them

---------18:50----------
so here's the problem that I was having

---------18:52----------
with the Kester EP 256 I'm not going to

---------18:57----------
say it's a bad solder paste it's

---------18:58----------
actually a good solder paste it's just

---------18:59----------
not the best solder paste because it has

---------19:02----------
a tendency the tendency with it for the

---------19:04----------
balls to kind of jump out like it ball

---------19:06----------
would jump out now in the middle I

---------19:08----------
expect that to happen because this this

---------19:11----------
is not the right stencil for this SMC

---------19:13----------
just keep that in mind I'm using the

---------19:14----------
wrong stencil because I don't have the

---------19:15----------
proper stencil so these balls over here

---------19:17----------
don't have a solder pad under those of

---------19:19----------
course then those are going to jump out

---------19:20----------
I expect that naturally to happen what I

---------19:23----------
don't expect to happen are the balls

---------19:24----------
that are inside the butt the solder

---------19:27----------
paste that's inside of the stencil holes

---------19:29----------
where there's a pad on the SMC under it

---------19:32----------
those I don't expect to jump out so this

---------19:34----------
stuff overall I've noticed just a little

---------19:36----------
bit more stable in terms of you know

---------19:37----------
balls randomly jumping out

---------19:44----------
you

---------19:49----------
I'm at 360 C and and 50% there on the

---------19:53----------
JBC JT a

---------19:59----------
very reasonable temperature

---------20:04----------
from a you know control temperature from

---------20:07----------
the from the interface you control

---------20:09----------
temperature with your hands you control

---------20:11----------
temperature with distance with angle so

---------20:15----------
if I want an area to get hotter I go

---------20:18----------
closer and I change the angle at which

---------20:19----------
I'm pointed at it I want an area to get

---------20:22----------
cooler I take the iron away or I point

---------20:25----------
it slightly in a different direction and

---------20:28----------
the ball just tried to combine and turn

---------20:31----------
into another ball that was actually from

---------20:33----------
my bad cleaning so I can't really hey

---------20:35----------
get out of it shoo

---------20:37----------
that has nothing to do with the actual

---------20:39----------
product that has to do with me sucking

---------20:41----------
at cleaning the stencil we're just going

---------20:45----------
to grab that excess

---------20:53----------
I actually went better than I thought it

---------20:55----------
would and grab that little excess ball

---------20:58----------
over here as well

---------21:03----------
there we go now some of it is not

---------21:08----------
perfectly melted like the stuff at the

---------21:10----------
bottom this wasn't a particularly great

---------21:12----------
job that I did but see this is the good

---------21:15----------
stuff about having good equipment good

---------21:17----------
tools and good materials is that I

---------21:19----------
actually did do a really this was a

---------21:21----------
pretty bad job like by anybody who does

---------21:24----------
this for a living they would look at

---------21:25----------
what I did and what I've done here and

---------21:26----------
say that this sucks

---------21:27----------
and even though I did a job it still

---------21:30----------
worked like you can get away with a

---------21:32----------
greater level of idiocy when you're

---------21:34----------
using better tools than you can when

---------21:36----------
you're not using the good tools I don't

---------21:38----------
have to worry about how much I suck as

---------21:40----------
much as I would if I was using you know

---------21:44----------
scrap your stuff and the ability to suck

---------21:48----------
is a really really nice luxury I would

---------21:52----------
say let's get those bottom balls that

---------21:56----------
didn't melt all the way

---------22:01----------
you

---------22:09----------
okay I'm gonna remove the stencil now so

---------22:13----------
first I'm going to remove the tape nice

---------22:14----------
and slow thing is you don't want to rip

---------22:17----------
balls that are you don't want to rip off

---------22:19----------
the stencil

---------22:19----------
if the stencil has kind of gotten cold

---------22:22----------
around the balls because when it gets

---------22:24----------
cold it's going to it's going to

---------22:26----------
contract and then the ball it's going to

---------22:29----------
rip the ball off and take the pad with

---------22:32----------
it so I'm not going to heat it

---------22:33----------
necessarily to melt solder I'm just

---------22:34----------
going to keep put some heat on this just

---------22:36----------
so that it expands a little bit and

---------22:40----------
allows the stencil to come off without

---------22:42----------
ripping anything good stuff and the

---------22:46----------
stencil just got sucked into my air

---------22:47----------
filter great I have to pick that out

---------22:49----------
later so now a couple of items of

---------22:51----------
concern are going to be this little ball

---------22:53----------
that wants to combine with another ball

---------22:56----------
that little ball there is a little too

---------22:58----------
big

---------22:58----------
those are both concerns that I'll be

---------23:00----------
able to address in a second first I'm

---------23:02----------
going to do just even everything out so

---------23:04----------
I have every ball on there as I'm going

---------23:06----------
to put some flux

---------23:12----------
and with the flux I mean that now I'm

---------23:14----------
going to put the temperature in the air

---------23:15----------
a little higher because I don't have to

---------23:17----------
worry about things jumping the balls are

---------23:18----------
already stuck and since the balls are

---------23:21----------
already stuck onto the pads you know

---------23:23----------
they're gonna they're going to kind of

---------23:24----------
stay there so I don't know if to worry

---------23:25----------
about jumping as much or at all really

---------23:30----------
do this and the balls are going to even

---------23:33----------
themselves out very nicely see how

---------23:36----------
everything's kind of sliding its way

---------23:37----------
into place that has something stuck

---------23:43----------
there that shouldn't be there

---------23:46----------
and now we're good oh good

---------23:52----------
okay yeah this one could look a little

---------23:55----------
nicer the one on the corner there could

---------23:58----------
look a little nicer Oh beautiful I think

---------24:04----------
that this is a sexy set of balls so now

---------24:07----------
we're going to go back to our board and

---------24:10----------
we're going to solder this on and pray

---------24:12----------
that again there's a lot of praying

---------24:13----------
involved to you so I took this off of a

---------24:15----------
piece of dead board now I have to

---------24:17----------
kind of hope that the piece of dead

---------24:19----------
board wasn't dead because it had a dead

---------24:21----------
SMC if the piece of that board was

---------24:23----------
dead because it had a dead SMC then I've

---------24:25----------
wasted a good amount of my time

---------24:27----------
now it's suck I'll be awful so let's see

---------24:32----------
so let's get orientation here the

---------24:34----------
orientation of the SMC is luckily it has

---------24:38----------
this this over here which this is a dead

---------24:41----------
giveaway of orientation and in just in

---------24:48----------
case you forget it let's put on the chip

---------24:51----------
for you so you can't so we're going to

---------24:53----------
add some flux here

---------25:05----------
I'm going to take my chip and I'm going

---------25:07----------
to try to wipe off some of this excess

---------25:09----------
junk on it with another cleanroom wipe

---------25:13----------
and then you'll see how I handle the

---------25:17----------
xxxx plus the excess flux that I have on

---------25:20----------
the board there I'm going to move the

---------25:22----------
chip around and then push it nice and

---------25:23----------
flat on the board and while while the

---------25:32----------
chip is in the clamp the top side of the

---------25:34----------
chip accumulates in the but a lot of

---------25:36----------
flux because it's upside down when I was

---------25:40----------
adding a bunch of flux to the bottom as

---------25:42----------
I was reheating the balls so getting off

---------25:47----------
the excess of that comes in handy all

---------25:52----------
right

---------25:55----------
now I have my chip here's what I'm doing

---------25:57----------
see what I'm doing I want that I don't

---------25:58----------
want there to be more flux on one set of

---------26:00----------
balls than another so I'm just going to

---------26:02----------
kind of move it around like this I want

---------26:04----------
to make sure the flux is on every single

---------26:06----------
ball and I want to make sure the flux is

---------26:09----------
on every single pad then once I get it

---------26:17----------
somewhere near Center and again Apple

---------26:19----------
doesn't have markings on boards like

---------26:20----------
every other company in existence so you

---------26:22----------
kinda have to guess where it goes which

---------26:23----------
is but again we're dealing with

---------26:25----------
Apple products here we're not dealing

---------26:26----------
with the products that are in them

---------26:28----------
designed with with us in mind we're

---------26:30----------
dealing with products that are designed

---------26:32----------
with making our lives harder in mine so

---------26:34----------
we're going to find the middle of it by

---------26:37----------
once you push down and you notice that

---------26:39----------
it's not moving around much when you

---------26:41----------
when you when you vibrate your hands a

---------26:42----------
little bit you'll know that every single

---------26:44----------
ball is touching the center of one of

---------26:48----------
those pads now the other thing is I want

---------26:50----------
that chip to be flat on the

---------26:51----------
board I don't want it to be floating on

---------26:53----------
a little sea of flux that on so I put

---------26:56----------
pushing down is very important to me

---------26:58----------
okay and now at this point we pray that

---------27:03----------
it is in the right space again these

---------27:06----------
boards are unmarked there's no way to

---------27:07----------
know now it's going to jiggle around a

---------27:10----------
little but you have to understand that

---------27:12----------
jiggling around is actually going to be

---------27:13----------
the you know the what this the pad has

---------27:16----------
some space to it so that since the pad

---------27:18----------
has some space through it there is

---------27:19----------
always going to be a little bit of

---------27:20----------
jiggling around but you don't want there

---------27:23----------
to be so much tickling around that you

---------27:24----------
can move the SMC a lot out of place so

---------27:29----------
now from here we're going to solder it

---------27:34----------
wish me luck that this piece of

---------27:35----------
works because again only you could have

---------27:38----------
seen the board I took this off of so

---------27:40----------
we're going to preheat the board and I

---------27:43----------
don't want to overheat the chip I don't

---------27:44----------
want to burn the chip so if the board is

---------27:46----------
hot then if the board is hot then I will

---------27:48----------
need less heat from the hot air station

---------27:49----------
the side of the chip you see let's say

---------27:53----------
the board itself is let's say let's say

---------27:55----------
the board is like 15 Celsius or

---------27:57----------
something right and I need to heat the

---------27:59----------
chip to like 230 or 250 or 290 well

---------28:03----------
let's well the board is going to be

---------28:04----------
dragging the temperature down towards it

---------28:06----------
so if the board is 15 Celsius I'm going

---------28:08----------
to have to heat this at 400 Celsius or

---------28:10----------
3of look just to get the make up for the

---------28:13----------
fact that the board is going to be

---------28:14----------
absorbing my heat away so I have this at

---------28:15----------
400 the board is going to be absorbing

---------28:18----------
my heat and bringing my temperature down

---------28:19----------
at 200 so I but if the board itself is

---------28:22----------
at 200 then I can use the iron that's

---------28:24----------
something like you could use the iron at

---------28:26----------
something well you know 230 and it will

---------28:29----------
solder the chip so what I do is I just I

---------28:31----------
heat everything very slowly because I

---------28:35----------
want the board itself to be nice and

---------28:37----------
nice and toasty I don't want us I don't

---------28:42----------
want to burn anything

---------28:43----------
[Laughter]

---------28:47----------
not even close to solder melting

---------28:49----------
temperature make sure that my chip is

---------28:52----------
flat on the board

---------28:52----------
good now eventually you're going to see

---------28:55----------
a little flux puddle is going to is

---------28:58----------
going to go away it's not going to be as

---------29:00----------
much flux in the flux puddle and once

---------29:01----------
that happens you'll know that you're

---------29:03----------
safe to go in on the chip that flux

---------29:06----------
puddle is not going to run your chip

---------29:08----------
away

---------29:14----------
I'm still not close enough for actual

---------29:16----------
soldering to take place here

---------29:23----------
I'm still preheating but now I'm

---------29:25----------
preheating the chip in addition to the

---------29:26----------
board you saw it moved a little right

---------29:28----------
you saw that and it just moved into

---------29:30----------
place but now I need to know that the

---------29:32----------
center ball is melted which is why I'm

---------29:33----------
going to get really close and make it

---------29:35----------
dance by moving around and changing the

---------29:37----------
angle that I'm pointing at you see how

---------29:38----------
it's dancing that's how I know that the

---------29:41----------
center balls have melted in addition to

---------29:42----------
the old to the outer balls now I'm going

---------29:45----------
to let everything dry you can see all

---------29:46----------
little things around the dry and this is

---------29:50----------
the part where we tell a little prayer

---------29:51----------
so I'm not sure if you're religious or

---------29:53----------
not I'm not particularly religious but I

---------29:55----------
like to pray to the you know to the the

---------29:58----------
parts been God that that the the SMC

---------30:00----------
that I just drew is is a good one

---------30:05----------
do it again this stuff is not yeah it's

---------30:10----------
not like I'm buying this just these

---------30:11----------
parts from Apple it's not like any

---------30:13----------
company is actually going to sell this

---------30:14----------
stuff to you you just kind of have to

---------30:16----------
hope and pray that you didn't just waste

---------30:20----------
40 minutes of your life you know that's

---------30:22----------
really what it is that's why this

---------30:25----------
industry sucks

---------30:28----------
okay so

---------30:40----------
alcohol is cold so click cooling down

---------30:43----------
the trip a little bit okay now at this

---------30:46----------
point first thing I want to do is see if

---------30:47----------
I'm back where I started so in battery

---------30:50----------
recognition whatever owl I just want to

---------30:53----------
know that I'm back where I started

---------30:54----------
because believe it or not when you're

---------30:56----------
when you're taking parts off of off of

---------30:58----------
boards that look like complete that

---------31:00----------
that's actually a celebration so if

---------31:03----------
you're literally you think if you're

---------31:05----------
back if I'm back where I started and I

---------31:07----------
don't have battery recognition I will

---------31:09----------
actually still be a little happy I mean

---------31:12----------
I would be happier that if I was better

---------31:15----------
than where I started sure but again you

---------31:18----------
can't be greedy so I'm going to put a

---------31:22----------
fan on it I'm going to see if the fan

---------31:23----------
spins so I have a green light and the

---------31:33----------
fan actually spun so at the very least

---------31:37----------
I'm back where I started

---------31:39----------
you can you believe that that's a

---------31:41----------
natural genuine honest smile not even

---------31:44----------
from fixing anything just from being

---------31:45----------
back to where I started this is such a

---------31:48----------
 pathetic industry I mean really

---------31:49----------
alright so now what I'm going to do here

---------31:52----------
is I'm going to grab a battery and we're

---------31:56----------
going to really not this battery we're

---------32:02----------
going to grab a better battery that's of

---------32:07----------
course that's another tradition we have

---------32:08----------
here so we look at apart we figure that

---------32:10----------
that's a part that's god-awful and

---------32:11----------
because you don't have any means to test

---------32:13----------
it at the time it just goes back in the

---------32:14----------
slot thus continuing the trend so I'm

---------32:18----------
going to plug this one in and let's see

---------32:20----------
if the light turns orange mofo oh yeah

---------32:29----------
as you can see here the light turned

---------32:32----------
orange can you see that

---------32:40----------
all right happy so yeah that's a

---------32:47----------
demonstration of this Amtech solder

---------32:49----------
paste this Amtech solder paste is a

---------32:52----------
great alternative to using little balls

---------32:53----------
the reason I think that this is better

---------32:55----------
than using little balls and actually

---------32:57----------
buying 0.3 millimeter balls is when you

---------32:59----------
put all the point three millimeter balls

---------33:01----------
inside the stencil and you start heating

---------33:03----------
them

---------33:03----------
here's the two things are going to

---------33:05----------
happen the first thing that's going to

---------33:06----------
happen is you're going to see that each

---------33:07----------
one of those holes actually has space

---------33:09----------
for one and a half balls so you're going

---------33:11----------
to find yourself with a little set of

---------33:12----------
tweezers going dink dink dink dink for

---------33:16----------
about five or ten minutes after you put

---------33:17----------
the solder balls down there and you're

---------33:19----------
going to be taking out all the excess

---------33:20----------
solder balls from the holes which is a

---------33:22----------
 nightmare and second thing that

---------33:24----------
happens with them is they love they like

---------33:26----------
nothing more in lights to jump out of

---------33:28----------
the hole and combine with another ball

---------33:29----------
whereas the solder paste with the solder

---------33:31----------
paste does it it's like in there at this

---------33:33----------
pace and then you'll see it zoom it kind

---------33:35----------
of turns over like a pokeball capturing

---------33:37----------
a pokemon it does this but it doesn't go

---------33:39----------
zinc and jump out of the stencils like

---------33:41----------
they'd say this is the stencil you have

---------33:43----------
the ball and the stencil in it go they

---------33:45----------
have the solder paste and it kind of

---------33:46----------
goes zinc which is nice the solder ball

---------33:49----------
will usually do something like them

---------33:51----------
zum-zum and you don't know if it's going

---------33:54----------
to jump out or not it just man it it's

---------33:55----------
just with bigger stuff with it with like

---------33:58----------
a graphics chip or a CPU solder balls

---------34:00----------
great that's a good way to go but with

---------34:02----------
the small stuff I will not torture

---------34:03----------
myself with buying little balls it's

---------34:05----------
some pretty good stuff and I will be

---------34:08----------
selling it I'm going to put a link in

---------34:10----------
the description to where you can buy

---------34:11----------
this so now not only do we sell mtech

---------34:13----------
flux we also sell Amtech solder paste

---------34:17----------
and thank you for watching hopefully you

---------34:19----------
have some successful repairs like this

---------34:21----------
one here again I'm still surprised said

---------34:24----------
if you sell the boards that these came

---------34:26----------
off I mean like like if you saw with

---------34:30----------
these things look like you would

---------34:31----------
you would understand why I'm so happy

---------34:33----------
and when anything works but that's it

---------34:35----------
for today thank you very much for

---------34:36----------
watching
