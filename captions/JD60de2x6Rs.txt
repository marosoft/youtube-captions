---------00:00----------
I see green green hey everybody how are

---------00:08----------
you all doing today so we're gonna get

---------00:10----------
started working on and get another

---------00:11----------
MacBook today and there's the MacBook

---------00:15----------
y'all happy to see that little MacBook

---------00:17----------
that's what I thought isn't it a

---------00:20----------
beautiful beautiful MacBook by the way I

---------00:23----------
wanted to say thank you very much the

---------00:24----------
Charlie Chan for these beautiful nitrile

---------00:26----------
gloves nitrile gloves have returned my

---------00:30----------
normal supplier does not have nitrile

---------00:32----------
gloves and all the places that I usually

---------00:35----------
buy them from our sold out or price

---------00:36----------
gouging so he got me a set of purple

---------00:39----------
gloves looked like a happy little Disney

---------00:41----------
character I love it

---------00:42----------
thank you I appreciate it let's see if

---------00:47----------
we can fix this MacBook Air for the

---------00:48----------
first thing we're gonna do is turn on my

---------00:50----------
power supply just get my power supply

---------00:53----------
software on

---------00:55----------
can you please repair in New York City

---------00:57----------
Louis no I can't I cannot fix New York

---------01:00----------
City at all nor can anybody else so we

---------01:03----------
have 25 percent of the renters have not

---------01:05----------
paid their rent since March that's with

---------01:09----------
and now keep in mind we have a

---------01:10----------
moratorium on evictions right now which

---------01:13----------
is pretty much a joke since there's no

---------01:15----------
moratorium on property taxes so the

---------01:17----------
landlords are gonna leave take a jump on

---------01:19----------
at the moment that they are back it can

---------01:21----------
start a victim again and we also have

---------01:24----------
the cares Act giving people I believe

---------01:26----------
six hundred dollars a week and

---------01:27----------
unemployment during the time that they

---------01:30----------
can't work once evictions are back and

---------01:34----------
the $600 a week unemployment is taken

---------01:36----------
away and the lock downs are still in

---------01:38----------
session and even to walk downs and most

---------01:40----------
of those companies may not be coming

---------01:41----------
back oh man you've got a nice little

---------01:45----------
recipe there for an absolute absolute

---------01:48----------
utter chaos and that's gonna be

---------01:50----------
interesting I feel genuinely bad for

---------01:52----------
what's gonna be happening to the city

---------01:53----------
over the next few months but I cannot

---------01:55----------
imagine that any of it is gonna be good

---------01:58----------
hi yeah I'm a again I'm one of those

---------02:00----------
people were I'm a pessimist but I also

---------02:02----------
hope I'm wrong I actually enjoy being

---------02:04----------
proven wrong as a pessimist because if

---------02:06----------
I'm proven wrong as a pessimist that

---------02:08----------
means that something good happens so I

---------02:10----------
really really hope that I am proven

---------02:13----------
wrong

---------02:13----------
anyway let's see what this MacBook does

---------02:14----------
20 mil amps 23 mil a mess and it settles

---------02:18----------
at 23 B see how it's going back and

---------02:19----------
forth twenty-two twenty-three twenty-two

---------02:20----------
twenty-three twenty-two twenty-three

---------02:22----------
twenty-two twenty-three

---------02:22----------
it's not a large range but it's enough

---------02:24----------
that I can see that the MacBook is

---------02:27----------
trying to do something so let's take the

---------02:29----------
board out of the case and see if we can

---------02:31----------
figure out what it is that's causing it

---------02:33----------
to jump up and down like that wow it's

---------02:35----------
been a while since I've been on camera

---------02:37----------
that's me using a t8 screwdriver on a

---------02:39----------
MacBook Air that that's pretty stupid

---------02:42----------
okay can we at least pretend that I

---------02:44----------
remember how to fix a MacBook yep

---------02:49----------
totally dinosaur why do you use a ball

---------02:51----------
mouse I use this because my desk does

---------02:54----------
not have a lot of space on it so if I

---------02:55----------
had a mouse having to do this it's like

---------02:57----------
oh hit my soldering iron oh I hit my mat

---------02:59----------
but if I have this I can I can go all

---------03:02----------
around the screen just like this the

---------03:04----------
problem is that this log of tech is a

---------03:06----------
piece of [ __ ] so this is the m5 70 don't

---------03:08----------
buy this this thing sucks I have gone

---------03:10----------
through several of them it's not it's

---------03:14----------
not a good product so it has this thing

---------03:16----------
where even if you clean the sensors and

---------03:18----------
replace the ball then all of that it'll

---------03:21----------
lose accuracy over time and become more

---------03:22----------
and more aggravating and it's really

---------03:25----------
something we're like again I like I've

---------03:27----------
cleaned it sorry about that I had to

---------03:29----------
handle some business with my CPA working

---------03:31----------
on a potential 501 c3 that works and

---------03:35----------
supports people in the repair industry

---------03:38----------
through providing classes education

---------03:42----------
guides in all areas not simply just

---------03:47----------
MacBook board repair like on my channel

---------03:48----------
but something that would supply that

---------03:50----------
where it would pay for people who are

---------03:53----------
the best in class in the field to create

---------03:54----------
manuals and guides and videos and how to

---------03:57----------
do all different types of things whether

---------03:59----------
it's screen refurbishing or iPhone data

---------04:02----------
recovery or all different types of

---------04:04----------
little things as well as more effective

---------04:08----------
lobbying like I'd really like to ramp up

---------04:11----------
things like getting Google to allow

---------04:14----------
AdWords getting Google to allow repair

---------04:16----------
people back on the AdWords platform

---------04:17----------
again and getting legislation move

---------04:21----------
forward faster than the pace of a snail

---------04:24----------
and

---------04:24----------
you know we'll see someone reached out

---------04:27----------
and said they were interested in

---------04:29----------
donating to the cause and how would you

---------04:32----------
know what would someone pretty much

---------04:33----------
reached out and said what would you do

---------04:35----------
if you had a real budget for this I

---------04:36----------
wrote them up yeah you know just the

---------04:38----------
basic little list of what it is that I

---------04:40----------
would do if I had a real budget for it

---------04:42----------
and I now we're going to find out if

---------04:44----------
they were pulling my leg I don't think

---------04:46----------
they're pulling my leg they seem like a

---------04:47----------
nice good nice person but then again you

---------04:49----------
know money is money money is money

---------04:51----------
so we'll see what they do that we'll see

---------04:55----------
what they do there I don't know if air

---------04:59----------
pods are fixable

---------04:59----------
you shouldn't fix don't know they they

---------05:01----------
sound like [ __ ] well what the [ __ ]

---------05:03----------
you're doing with our pods make things

---------05:04----------
ever give her that [ __ ] get yourself a

---------05:06----------
nice set of eating marks or something

---------05:07----------
anyway so let's take a look over this

---------05:10----------
board and see if there's anything that

---------05:11----------
stands out as obvious as to why it is we

---------05:15----------
have 23 milliamps so this is an 8 - 0 -

---------05:19----------
2 0 0 165 MacBook Air basic basic board

---------05:22----------
turn on multimeter my wife got them for

---------05:26----------
free that's too expensive way too

---------05:29----------
expensive you pay too much for those all

---------05:30----------
right so I'm just going to go down the

---------05:31----------
basic list of power rails so you know

---------05:34----------
one of the main ones that is here is the

---------05:36----------
pp bus of G 3 hot 8.6 steady all right

---------05:43----------
pp 3 V 4 2 is present because we have a

---------05:45----------
light on our charger what is the CP a

---------05:47----------
CPA is a certified public accountant

---------05:50----------
certified professional accountant

---------05:51----------
certified does my taxes for me BC that I

---------05:55----------
don't [ __ ] them up all right so you have

---------05:58----------
TP PV RT C g3 huh

---------05:59----------
we have PP 5vs5 we here is where we

---------06:04----------
messed PP 5 es 4

---------06:12----------
so this is gonna be a good old missing

---------06:15----------
p.m. sleep s4l these are medium gloves

---------06:17----------
Charles thank you very much

---------06:19----------
everybody a round of applause in the

---------06:21----------
chat to mr. Charles who found these

---------06:23----------
gloves and was generous enough to buy

---------06:26----------
them for us I could not find these

---------06:27----------
things anywhere I gave up trying to sign

---------06:30----------
nitrile gloves night real nitrile night

---------06:35----------
try nitrile I don't know how I don't

---------06:37----------
know how you pronounce it the ones that

---------06:39----------
don't suck

---------06:40----------
you know latex leaves powder on you

---------06:43----------
vinyl is it breaks real easy but night

---------06:45----------
to die yes these don't break easy

---------06:49----------
all right so you're open up a schematic

---------06:52----------
and aboard view and we are going to take

---------06:55----------
a look at some things so this is

---------06:59----------
probably going to be your standard PM

---------07:00----------
sleep best for all missing disaster P 5

---------07:04----------
vs 4 RS 3 and and this is P 5 vs 4 RS 3

---------07:13----------
and here which comes from s4 pal which

---------07:19----------
comes from PM sleeve s4l PM sleep s4l

---------07:23----------
comes from the PCH PM sleep s4l yep

---------07:35----------
so let's see what that is it's it's

---------07:39----------
gonna be missing cuz it's always that's

---------07:41----------
always what's missing let's just confirm

---------07:45----------
this is what Paul would call not fair

---------07:48----------
Paul would look at this board and say

---------07:51----------
that's not fair

---------07:54----------
Paul would be correct and when he says

---------07:56----------
that that's not fair by the way see a

---------08:02----------
little indent over there on pin two on

---------08:05----------
the right see how there's an indent is

---------08:07----------
actually able to hit pin two without the

---------08:09----------
microscope isn't that kind of cool yep

---------08:13----------
zero volts on p.m. sleep and it's not

---------08:16----------
jumping up and down either it's just

---------08:17----------
straight up dead aren't you happy folks

---------08:20----------
that there's a missing p.m. sleep s4l on

---------08:22----------
the desk yay ah very dusty pube seaboard

---------08:42----------
remember corrosion in my you 1950 area

---------08:45----------
can be a cause and I don't see corrosion

---------08:51----------
I just see a lot of dust but wait that's

---------08:53----------
a green thing what is that green thing

---------08:55----------
do you guys see what I'm looking at

---------08:58----------
that's some green [ __ ] right there

---------09:02----------
that's some green I see green green you

---------09:12----------
gotta admit that's kind of hard to see I

---------09:14----------
guess I didn't know to look there from

---------09:16----------
previous cases I really wouldn't have

---------09:18----------
looked there this is what we call the

---------09:25----------
hell Mary this is what we call to please

---------09:31----------
be this because if it's not this I don't

---------09:32----------
know what it is and I give up Green is

---------09:40----------
the color of Hope yes it is yes it is

---------09:42----------
folks thank you

---------09:53----------
the camera is not focusing the camera is

---------09:56----------
not with focus as I do so it's I'm not

---------10:02----------
focusing your problem is not with the

---------10:04----------
camera it's with me

---------10:29----------
oh man

---------10:31----------
New York City is so [ __ ] like it's so

---------10:36----------
[ __ ] I don't really know exactly what

---------10:38----------
to do about it I don't see your recovery

---------10:42----------
to this I really don't 25% have not paid

---------10:45----------
rent since March that's with with the

---------10:49----------
care is acting the $600 in unemployment

---------10:51----------
now maybe that's because that actually

---------10:53----------
isn't enough to pay rent in this city

---------10:55----------
maybe that's because there were a bunch

---------10:56----------
of [ __ ] stipulations that kept

---------10:58----------
people from getting it I mean if the

---------11:00----------
stipulations for that or even the

---------11:01----------
quarter as ridiculous as the PPP [ __ ]

---------11:03----------
then I can only imagine but yeah like

---------11:11----------
regard man that that's a mess that is

---------11:14----------
such a mess

---------11:16----------
like this city was already barely

---------11:19----------
hanging on by a thread there because for

---------11:24----------
all you hear about all the wealth in

---------11:25----------
this city there's a lot of wealth but

---------11:27----------
there's also way more like way more

---------11:30----------
broke people that are barely clinging on

---------11:33----------
with your 2000 or $3000 shitty tiny

---------11:36----------
apartments and yeah you may say that

---------11:40----------
some of those people are gonna leave you

---------11:41----------
may say that some of those people will

---------11:43----------
be leaving the city well then we're

---------11:45----------
gonna be staying and just becoming more

---------11:48----------
disagreeable shall I say disagreeable

---------12:11----------
don't worry leave it to me I know how to

---------12:12----------
fix New York dye spectrum die I take

---------12:18----------
your dollar and I light it on fire

---------12:35----------
Coleco says wealthy only used New York

---------12:37----------
to launder invest money you know there's

---------12:39----------
a really interesting article on this it

---------12:40----------
was the New York real estate is a new

---------12:43----------
Swiss bank account and it really is

---------12:44----------
because a lot of the housing here

---------12:46----------
because typically the more conservative

---------12:48----------
argument is well you have way too many

---------12:51----------
restrictions and regulations that make

---------12:53----------
it difficult to build new housing if you

---------12:55----------
built new housing you would have a

---------12:56----------
housing problem and point taken if you

---------12:58----------
make it more difficult to build housing

---------12:59----------
they'll be less housing less housing

---------13:00----------
means housing shortage housing shortage

---------13:02----------
mean price go up price go up mean it

---------13:04----------
however you also have the issue that

---------13:06----------
when new housing is created it winds up

---------13:09----------
being marketed to people that don't live

---------13:12----------
here at prices that people live here

---------13:14----------
would never be able to afford in their

---------13:16----------
lives and I mean even if it was at

---------13:20----------
prices they can afford here it doesn't

---------13:22----------
even matter because it wind up being

---------13:23----------
bought up by by people who were

---------13:27----------
laundering money in other countries like

---------13:29----------
New York is a big like this is this has

---------13:32----------
been a spot for years to launder your

---------13:34----------
money from another country and just

---------13:38----------
drink some water before we try this up

---------13:46----------
[Applause]

---------13:51----------
that's why even when there is a real

---------13:52----------
estate crash it's not something that

---------13:54----------
particularly excites me because it's all

---------13:56----------
gonna get if there's even a minor dip in

---------13:58----------
prices it's it's gonna be bought up by

---------14:00----------
people who are looking to wash dirty

---------14:03----------
cash not people who live here

---------14:11----------
okay so we've got 23 MLMs and we did not

---------14:16----------
solve our problem did we we did not

---------14:19----------
solve our problem one bit hmm

---------14:24----------
he's our SSD shorting pp 3 v 3s o to

---------14:28----------
ground perhaps maybe maybe not that

---------14:31----------
would be interesting if it was let's see

---------14:33----------
one way to find out right

---------14:35----------
oh no refurbish board uh why not notice

---------14:44----------
the sooner it says that far you on it it

---------14:49----------
has Apple and a little sticker this is

---------14:51----------
gonna be a refurb isn't it you're an

---------14:54----------
apple refurb board aren't you yeah

---------15:00----------
that's what Erica would do she wouldn't

---------15:02----------
make that little noise she makes these

---------15:05----------
very strange noises of like a like a

---------15:08----------
cartoon creature or something knowing

---------15:13----------
this is an Apple refurb board means

---------15:15----------
knowing that anything can be screwed up

---------15:17----------
on it so

---------15:25----------
Oh what is the first thing that you see

---------15:28----------
there really

---------15:30----------
you left corrode minor sign a corrosion

---------15:34----------
on the SMC recent resistor so that's not

---------15:36----------
gonna be it you guys we

---------15:58----------
all right let's look for hints tell me

---------16:01----------
if you see anything what do you see

---------16:21----------
okay you see a reworking of the

---------16:23----------
Thunderbolt area

---------16:39----------
it's flux on the board do you even

---------16:42----------
ultrasonic Apple do you even ultrasonic

---------16:45----------
Apple the gloves and currently rocking

---------16:51----------
our yellow I hate the latex gloves latex

---------16:55----------
is the worst followed by vinyl then you

---------16:58----------
get nitrile which are much better oh man

---------17:07----------
ok so I'm gonna guess if there was

---------17:09----------
rework here that they did something with

---------17:10----------
a Thunderbolt circuit so I'm gonna take

---------17:12----------
a look at Thunderbolt power rails later

---------17:42----------
wait a second what is this [ __ ] I can't

---------17:46----------
even tell if that's pubes or damage like

---------17:48----------
what is this okay so that's just really

---------17:52----------
nasty pubes but it looks bad doesn't it

---------19:26----------
[Applause]

---------20:52----------
hiss whoa whoa here you go

---------20:57----------
bada-bing so you have corrosion around

---------21:01----------
the looks like that that hair by the

---------21:05----------
clock chip was it so this MacBook was a

---------21:08----------
refurbished MacBook so it looks like it

---------21:10----------
was one of the Apple refurbished ones

---------21:11----------
and it looks like they missed the fact

---------21:16----------
that there was a corrosion by the SMC

---------21:17----------
reset resistor minor nastiness Bayou

---------21:20----------
1950 they left the flux on the board

---------21:22----------
they left the effing like I don't want

---------21:25----------
to hear any of this I use too much flux

---------21:26----------
[ __ ] you know what I may use 30 CC's of

---------21:29----------
flux for every board repair it but you

---------21:30----------
know what I do after I'm done with it it

---------21:32----------
goes in an ultrasonic cleaner for about

---------21:34----------
two to four minutes washes everything

---------21:35----------
off at 60 Celsius with Branson EC then

---------21:38----------
it goes into a vat of alcohol then it

---------21:40----------
gets dry it off by air then it gets put

---------21:42----------
in an oven for about 230 Fahrenheit for

---------21:45----------
half an hour to an hour and then we

---------21:47----------
reassemble it that's it for today and as

---------21:49----------
always I hope you learn something
