---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna be

---------00:01----------
working on a MacBook Air that is dead

---------00:02----------
and doesn't turn on this is an

---------00:05----------
interesting one so this is somebody who

---------00:06----------
came here about six months ago because

---------00:09----------
they they had up their operating

---------00:10----------
system install and installed a bunch of

---------00:12----------
 that they weren't supposed to so we

---------00:13----------
fixed that for them and then they come

---------00:15----------
back about seven or eight months later

---------00:16----------
and the machine is a hundred percent

---------00:18----------
absolutely positively dead and guess who

---------00:22----------
gets blamed for it yeah no absolutely

---------00:26----------
not

---------00:26----------
so let's see so let's go over what could

---------00:28----------
be possibly be wrong here so this is a

---------00:30----------
MacBook Air board this is the eight to

---------00:32----------
zero dash 3209 so I'm going to plug in

---------00:35----------
the charger here and see what we find

---------00:36----------
now as I've said in many other videos on

---------00:39----------
this channel which you should watch

---------00:40----------
before watching this one because I'm not

---------00:41----------
gonna go over every single little thing

---------00:43----------
from the beginning because I got a lot

---------00:44----------
of stuff to do but I have done that in

---------00:46----------
other videos the PP + g3 hot rail is the

---------00:49----------
primary rail for most of the machine and

---------00:51----------
that's supposed to be eight point four

---------00:53----------
volts in a MacBook Air you'll see that

---------00:55----------
in the schematic and on this one it's

---------00:56----------
point six nine six so what's going to

---------00:59----------
cause that to happen let's see if it's a

---------01:01----------
short to ground so I put the multimeter

---------01:02----------
in ohms mode and let's see if when I get

---------01:05----------
here so there is zero point zero two

---------01:10----------
almost aground on my main power rail hmm

---------01:14----------
that's no good so let's put this thing

---------01:16----------
on and see if anything actually gets hot

---------01:19----------
now I remember when there's a shirt to

---------01:21----------
ground um PB Maestri three hot PP brush

---------01:23----------
D three hot powers a lot of different

---------01:25----------
things and one of the things that it

---------01:26----------
powers is the buck converter for the CPU

---------01:28----------
so let's say one of the high side

---------01:30----------
MOSFETs and again if you don't know how

---------01:31----------
buck converter works you should look at

---------01:33----------
my videos where I've talked about how a

---------01:34----------
buck converter works before we get to

---------01:35----------
this one so let's say one of those is

---------01:37----------
shorted so it's a the whole idea with a

---------01:39----------
buck converter is the transistor is

---------01:40----------
going to switch on and then off and then

---------01:42----------
on and off and then on and then off and

---------01:44----------
that eight volts you can have a pulse of

---------01:46----------
eight than zero the Nathan zero the

---------01:47----------
Nathan zero and through an inductor and

---------01:49----------
a bunch of capacitors that eight and

---------01:50----------
zero 8 and 0 and 0 will be averaged out

---------01:52----------
to something like 1 volt let's say that

---------01:55----------
that transistor is stuck it's on all the

---------01:57----------
time because it's broken what's going to

---------02:00----------
happen is it's going to send the entire

---------02:02----------
8 volts through so that's why I'm not

---------02:04----------
gonna just plug in the power supply here

---------02:05----------
and see if anything gets hot because on

---------02:07----------
the a20 3209 board you very often have

---------02:09----------
one of the high side CPU MOSFETs go bad

---------02:12----------
and you'll be able to tell because

---------02:13----------
you know again the thing is this is a

---------02:15----------
smart mission little machine it knows

---------02:17----------
that there's a short circuit so it's

---------02:19----------
going to limit the charger power so that

---------02:20----------
PP buys g3 hot is only putting out 0.5

---------02:23----------
volts

---------02:27----------
nothing is hot yet hmm let's see now if

---------02:33----------
I were to remove that CPU heatsink but

---------02:35----------
the CPU get hot that's one way cuz they

---------02:38----------
here's the thing if I just shove 8 volts

---------02:40----------
in there you know what's gonna happen if

---------02:42----------
that's going straight to the CPU my CPU

---------02:44----------
will see 8 volts my board will be dead

---------02:47----------
and then the person who blamed me for

---------02:49----------
killing their board because I you know I

---------02:52----------
had the audacity to remove mackeeper

---------02:54----------
from their computer they'll actually be

---------02:56----------
right I will have killed it and I am NOT

---------02:58----------
going to give this person that

---------02:59----------
satisfaction

---------03:02----------
customer customer the things like I get

---------03:05----------
it cuz I've had a lot of issues with

---------03:06----------
webhosts and Dru recently where I had a

---------03:09----------
web developer do something and then

---------03:10----------
right after they do it something else

---------03:11----------
doesn't work and like that and it seemed

---------03:14----------
like at 157 and stopped working and 156

---------03:17----------
is when you SSH 10 it's like out of

---------03:19----------
here but but stuff like this you really

---------03:22----------
you're gonna have people that they

---------03:24----------
really hold you responsible for

---------03:25----------
everything I mean like you install open

---------03:27----------
office in 2012 in 2017 their power

---------03:30----------
supply dies that computer guy

---------03:32----------
you know it's one of the it happens a

---------03:35----------
lot yeah CPU is getting warm and it's

---------03:41----------
not the caps that are next to the CPU

---------03:43----------
either or is it oh is it so the CPU is

---------03:52----------
oh you're boiling I didn't even have to

---------03:57----------
inject voltage here let's go over to my

---------04:00----------
short detection test by the way you may

---------04:01----------
notice that this looks a little better I

---------04:03----------
got some new capture Hardware recently

---------04:04----------
unfortunately I only bought one just to

---------04:06----------
see how it works the whole idea is

---------04:08----------
there's a color space the issues so my

---------04:11----------
original HDMI dongle wasn't able to deal

---------04:13----------
with the 4 2 2 color that comes out of

---------04:15----------
the camera in the microscope camera so

---------04:17----------
it was limiting and estimating things

---------04:19----------
I'm not smart enough to know how this

---------04:21----------
works but what I do know is that the

---------04:22----------
$300 USB dongle that I have actually

---------04:24----------
works worse than $189 Blackmagic thing

---------04:27----------
so when I used an HDMI splitter just to

---------04:30----------
see what it would look like in the

---------04:31----------
picture-in-picture directing the TV and

---------04:33----------
through the capture hardware the

---------04:34----------
Blackmagic looks exactly the same as the

---------04:36----------
direct output from the camcorder to the

---------04:38----------
monitor whereas the major well thing I

---------04:41----------
had doesn't look exact but what do you

---------04:43----------
expect for a HDMI device anyway

---------04:45----------
so let's take a look over here and let's

---------04:48----------
do a little bit of short detection so my

---------04:51----------
method of short detection again I am a

---------04:52----------
cheapskate I don't buy free spray I'm a

---------04:54----------
 cheapskate I'm not gonna spend

---------04:55----------
20 bucks on a little can of no so

---------04:58----------
what I do is I just put alcohol all over

---------05:00----------
the board and then I look for the region

---------05:02----------
that the alcohol disappears from first

---------05:05----------
hmm where is it sizzling hmm what is the

---------05:11----------
cause of my short is it that capacitor

---------05:18----------
or that is sizzling it's actually kind

---------05:21----------
of hard to tell there because it could

---------05:22----------
be the left one of the right now

---------05:23----------
it's you see I a DUI and spending

---------05:27----------
money on freeze spray I am a cheapskate

---------05:29----------
I'm not gonna buy I'm not buying an

---------05:32----------
x-ray machine I'm not buying a FLIR cam

---------05:34----------
I am sticking to alcohol because it will

---------05:37----------
evaporate instantly so mm which

---------05:40----------
capacitor is up my board

---------05:46----------
so I actually could have run voltage

---------05:48----------
through there and I wouldn't have killed

---------05:49----------
anything but still it's always good to

---------05:50----------
be safe and again that was burning even

---------05:53----------
at the 0.5 volts that I had see you saw

---------05:55----------
that the voltage that I had on PP buzz

---------05:57----------
g3 huh the voltage that I was getting

---------05:59----------
was actually it was 0.5 volts 0.5 volts

---------06:04----------
is not aligned it was still enough for

---------06:05----------
you to see that there was a short there

---------06:06----------
so let's get my Weller station hot here

---------06:08----------
so that I can remove that thing and we

---------06:10----------
are gonna remove that thing so here we

---------06:13----------
go so let's get the Weller hot nice and

---------06:15----------
ready now that's a big capacitor so it's

---------06:17----------
gonna be a little bit of a pain in the

---------06:18----------
ass to get off so I'm gonna get the

---------06:19----------
Weller turned up nice and high make sure

---------06:24----------
that I keep this unplugged this nozzles

---------06:27----------
a little probably a little too big I

---------06:29----------
should put on the smaller one oh well

---------06:35----------
come on get my cap off hey I almost

---------06:39----------
forgot to turn on the air filter whoa

---------06:41----------
that's a big no-no around here no

---------06:43----------
soldering without the air filter

---------07:00----------
this boy these boards are really hard to

---------07:02----------
remove things from it absorbs heat much

---------07:05----------
better than their older models I don't

---------07:08----------
know if that's really good thing all

---------07:12----------
right so now that I'm not gonna be able

---------07:14----------
to side of that with the standard micro

---------07:16----------
pencil that I have here

---------07:17----------
I need the bigger iron so I'm gonna

---------07:22----------
unplug this one be shut the up with

---------07:37----------
a hack I decided to make this

---------07:39----------
thing do that I really I want to meet

---------07:41----------
the person who decided to make this

---------07:43----------
thing beep I want to force them to sleep

---------07:45----------
in a room with this I want to tie them

---------07:48----------
to a chair oh shut your mouth

---------07:53----------
it also doesn't like when you switch

---------07:54----------
irons that's its way of telling you to

---------07:56----------
buy the eff m203 instead of the 951 and

---------07:59----------
just switching irons all the time watch

---------08:02----------
it'll shut up in a second it will shut

---------08:06----------
up there we go

---------08:13----------
didn't have to do anything just you just

---------08:16----------
have to wait it out you know it's like

---------08:19----------
marriage

---------08:26----------
all righty

---------08:31----------
okay we've got some solder over there

---------08:34----------
sold dirt I mean solder I don't want to

---------08:37----------
piss anybody off now and let's grab a

---------08:42----------
capacitor let's find a boy that has

---------08:47----------
those capacitors left on them this is

---------08:50----------
going to be a tough one I've stolen

---------08:53----------
almost every capacitor in that area from

---------08:55----------
every board you can imagine this is a

---------08:58----------
very common problem having donor boards

---------09:02----------
is a good thing it makes life a lot

---------09:03----------
easier

---------09:35----------
seriously you're not polarized are you

---------09:44----------
that would really suck since

---------09:54----------
you know what I'm a [ __ ] and I freak I

---------09:59----------
don't it'll actually take me less time

---------10:01----------
to walk over here then it would have

---------10:02----------
find the schematic and see if that's

---------10:04----------
polarized I know I'm being an idiot

---------10:08----------
I should just look in the schematic to

---------10:09----------
see if it's polarized and if so what way

---------10:11----------
but it will literally take me less time

---------10:13----------
to simply walk over here and look at

---------10:15----------
another board that is the same type in a

---------10:18----------
wall to open the PDF then open the board

---------10:20----------
view then find that cab then in control

---------10:22----------
F I mean just saying it takes time can

---------10:24----------
you imagine actually doing it would just

---------10:26----------
be so much wasted time

---------10:39----------
so what is your orientation

---------10:49----------
okay em in the lower right corner so I

---------10:56----------
would have had the orientation wrong why

---------10:58----------
isn't it a good thing that I checked and

---------11:01----------
again if it's not polarized it won't

---------11:04----------
really matter oh well let's blow this on

---------11:09----------
the board

---------11:24----------
so once it blows its way on the board

---------11:26----------
then I push it down because I want to

---------11:27----------
make sure that it's actually not just

---------11:29----------
floating on the side or again it's

---------11:30----------
really important to have things flat on

---------11:31----------
the motherboard because if they are off

---------11:33----------
the motherboard then it's easier to

---------11:35----------
knock them off get some it gives you

---------11:37----------
leverage to knock it off we don't want

---------11:40----------
leverage to knock our components off of

---------11:42----------
the board that's not a good thing at all

---------11:57----------
but isn't that a pain-in-the-ass area to

---------11:59----------
get to just wanna you make the joint

---------12:03----------
look a little nicer get rid of the

---------12:06----------
excess under there so there's already

---------12:07----------
some flux and yeah don't go nuts

---------12:12----------
touching it up no reason to go nuts

---------12:14----------
touching the joint that's a big problem

---------12:17----------
there's actually this great article

---------12:19----------
online that I want to feature in another

---------12:20----------
video it's on IPC certifications and how

---------12:25----------
I why the guy thinks that the entire

---------12:27----------
idea behind IPC certification is crap

---------12:29----------
and not really just why IPC

---------12:31----------
certification is crap I shouldn't say

---------12:32----------
that but while a lot of the rework

---------12:34----------
industry is really kind of full of

---------12:35----------
the whole idea is that a lot of the

---------12:38----------
times they're telling you to rework

---------12:40----------
joints that look that aren't

---------12:42----------
cosmetically perfect but that are

---------12:43----------
electrically sound and really good

---------12:45----------
joints the whole idea being that you're

---------12:48----------
going to rework a joint and that the

---------12:50----------
joint that you're reworking is a joint

---------12:52----------
that is fine but by heating it you're

---------12:54----------
now heating the component attached to it

---------12:57----------
again and the more you heat the

---------12:58----------
component the greater likelihood it is

---------13:00----------
that it's going to fail so you're making

---------13:01----------
stuff that looks nice but it's actually

---------13:03----------
a ticking time bomb compared to before

---------13:04----------
and you're actually paying a rework err

---------13:06----------
labor to sit there and rework joints

---------13:09----------
that would have otherwise been goods

---------13:10----------
you're increasing the cost of the

---------13:11----------
product that you're selling which is

---------13:12----------
crap and oh come on give me a green

---------13:17----------
light you had one before you mofo there

---------13:22----------
we go it was just being a troll as you

---------13:24----------
can see fan here is spinning see well

---------13:28----------
you can't see cuz there you go fan is

---------13:34----------
spinning so we fixed the problem and you

---------13:37----------
know I was just the capacitor shorted to

---------13:39----------
ground on the line I had again I didn't

---------13:40----------
even open the schematic to do this I

---------13:42----------
haven't opened the schematic or the

---------13:43----------
board view I guess I should do that

---------13:45----------
because at the end of the video I always

---------13:47----------
like to give you a little recap of what

---------13:48----------
it is we did to actually fix the problem

---------13:50----------
so that would be a nice thing to do here

---------13:52----------
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

---------13:53----------
switch over to the view where you can

---------13:55----------
see what's on my computer screen let's

---------13:57----------
find the capacitor that capacitor was I

---------14:01----------
believe this one C 76 20 so C 76 20 so

---------14:10----------
this is a

---------14:11----------
for the CPU vc cio 1.05 sol regulator so

---------14:16----------
this is the power line that comes on the

---------14:18----------
cpu before v cores presence so the

---------14:20----------
certain parts of the cpu turn on before

---------14:22----------
V core turns on and this is one of them

---------14:23----------
and PP VIN s oh whatever let's see where

---------14:28----------
that comes from

---------14:28----------
so that is a sub rail of pp VIN make

---------14:32----------
sure this is still gone yeah alright if

---------14:34----------
it's a sub rail of PPV ns5 bla bla bla

---------14:37----------
bla bla bla is a sub rail of pp bus G 3

---------14:40----------
hop pp best G 3 hot is the rail that we

---------14:42----------
shorted to ground this is G 3 hot

---------14:44----------
meaning always present rails why they

---------14:46----------
call it G three hottest beyond maybe

---------14:48----------
always present meaning it should

---------14:49----------
probably always be there it's his

---------14:51----------
voltage 8.4 my voltage on was 0.5 and

---------14:55----------
that's again this is I've gone over this

---------14:57----------
problem in a few other videos it's a

---------14:58----------
basic basic short to ground it's not

---------15:02----------
always going to be that capacitor it's

---------15:03----------
not always going to be that that is

---------15:05----------
shorted to ground on this board you will

---------15:06----------
always have to figure out what the

---------15:08----------
problem is for yourself you can't apply

---------15:10----------
my solution to your problem because you

---------15:12----------
may have a different problem than the

---------15:14----------
problem I have again what I'm trying to

---------15:15----------
get across with these videos it's not

---------15:17----------
that you do monkey-see monkey-do you're

---------15:18----------
like oh I'm gonna remove the same

---------15:19----------
capacitor lewiston my board will turn on

---------15:21----------
what if that's not the capacitor that's

---------15:23----------
wrong on your board what I'm trying to

---------15:24----------
do is I'm trying to get you used to

---------15:26----------
analytical thinking and problem solving

---------15:28----------
so that regardless of what your problem

---------15:29----------
is even if your problem is different

---------15:31----------
from my problem that you can solve it

---------15:32----------
for your house itself so hopefully this

---------15:34----------
has helped you
