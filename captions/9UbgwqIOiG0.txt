---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna be

---------00:01----------
working on a board that has no backlight

---------00:02----------
and no image and when you take a look in

---------00:04----------
the microscope do you really have to

---------00:07----------
think about why that is so yeah that's

---------00:12----------
that's nasty that is nasty

---------00:17----------
absolutely garbage so now the no

---------00:23----------
backlight is going to be caused by here

---------00:27----------
no image is gonna be caused by here and

---------00:30----------
let's just follow this back a little bit

---------00:31----------
so they have two pins of the LCD Kinect

---------00:35----------
I think I'm not even gonna open the

---------00:36----------
schematic for this I would be insulting

---------00:37----------
your intelligence by bothering so these

---------00:40----------
are gonna be the two pins that are used

---------00:41----------
for powering the LCDs image that's gonna

---------00:44----------
be used for the backlight now if you

---------00:46----------
follow these back they go to this

---------00:48----------
component and now what do you know this

---------00:49----------
component looks destroyed so this is an

---------00:52----------
inductor that's on the line that powers

---------00:55----------
the image circuitry so all that stuff

---------00:56----------
has got to go

---------00:57----------
so let's start it's getting rid of it

---------00:59----------
and just in case you weren't able to see

---------01:00----------
that since the microscope camera only

---------01:02----------
shows you a portion of what I see not

---------01:04----------
the whole thing

---------01:05----------
see this see you this over here leads

---------01:10----------
back here see that inductor no good so

---------01:14----------
let's zoom in on the inductor for a

---------01:15----------
moment you can see what I mean that is

---------01:20----------
no good and I will have to wait for this

---------01:24----------
damn hot air station heat up anyway so

---------01:25----------
while I'm waiting for the Weller to heat

---------01:28----------
up which I never have to do with the JBC

---------01:31----------
I'll show you on the schematic what's

---------01:36----------
going on so I have to open the schematic

---------01:38----------
for this board view for this model

---------01:40----------
motherboard the eight to zero thirty

---------01:43----------
it's not the h20 34:37 I think it's the

---------01:46----------
newer one but it's so close it doesn't

---------01:48----------
even really make a difference it's not

---------01:50----------
gonna make a of a difference they

---------01:52----------
haven't changed anything so la T 304 le

---------01:55----------
304 so see this LCD connector PP 3 V 3

---------02:01----------
that's 3.3 volts s oh when the computers

---------02:05----------
on for the LCD and that is going through

---------02:09----------
l-lady 304 which again I don't have to

---------02:13----------
measure

---------02:14----------
it's just bad so we're going to remove

---------02:16----------
this and see what happens

---------02:19----------
now obviously there will be no reusing

---------02:23----------
this gentleman's cable this LCD cable is

---------02:27----------
 let's take a look

---------02:31----------
yep I'm pretty sure if this was a

---------02:33----------
wholesale customer they'd try to plug

---------02:35----------
that back in in fact I ain't know if

---------02:37----------
this was a wholesale customer they try

---------02:38----------
to plug the back in that's why it's so

---------02:41----------
great to deal with retail people instead

---------02:43----------
of wholesale people you have no idea how

---------02:47----------
many people would try to plug that thing

---------02:48----------
back in I mean you think you think that

---------02:51----------
if somebody is a repair store that they

---------02:52----------
know better but no you'd think wrong

---------02:59----------
okay this is pretty boiling by now so

---------03:02----------
the stuff should be coming off without

---------03:06----------
any effort

---------04:31----------
don't see how good the micro pencil is

---------04:33----------
it wicking which is the exact opposite

---------04:35----------
of what it's supposed to be used for

---------04:52----------
yeah I should just plug in the big iron

---------04:57----------
yeah that's probably what I'd do if I

---------04:59----------
had a brain I plug in the iron

---------05:04----------
that's meant for these things quiet

---------05:08----------
turning around taking it off wall

---------05:11----------
unplugging this one hitting my thumb on

---------05:14----------
the hack okey plugging in the

---------05:17----------
new one listening to it [ __ ] at me

---------05:20----------
listening to it [ __ ] at me again and

---------05:22----------
beep then finally beep and be done and

---------05:26----------
you know who really wants to do all that

---------05:29----------
I guess I'll do all that because this is

---------05:31----------
not working

---------05:32----------
so hit my thumb ow listen it would beep

---------05:35----------
and [ __ ] at me you grab the new

---------05:38----------
iron burn the side of my hand putting

---------05:41----------
the old one back on them the rack plug

---------05:44----------
the new one in have my thumb on that ow

---------05:47----------
listen to it beep and [ __ ] at me

---------05:49----------
you

---------05:50----------
and very shortly it should finally be

---------05:53----------
ready to start working and shut the

---------05:55----------
up suck my dick hack oh they make some

---------06:00----------
of the most annoying gear in the world

---------06:01----------
really I mean like between putting the

---------06:04----------
key over here like putting the key right

---------06:07----------
where you're gonna plug something in

---------06:08----------
where the incessant beeping for

---------06:10----------
no reason I don't know who does this I

---------06:11----------
don't know if they just if they want you

---------06:14----------
to by welleran JBC you whatever it I

---------06:16----------
don't know who the who comes up with

---------06:17----------
this but whoever does needs to be

---------06:19----------
kicked in the nuts AK alright come on

---------06:25----------
that was a terrible wicking move oh god

---------06:28----------
this wicking is going awful

---------06:37----------
well that went absolutely awful

---------06:40----------
I did everything you're not supposed to

---------06:42----------
do when wicking I mean like everything

---------06:44----------
you're not supposed to do when wicking

---------06:47----------
and I still didn't rip a pad huh this is

---------06:52----------
an iPhone I have no pads left you

---------06:53----------
realize that this are you you're on the

---------06:55----------
same page if this was an iPhone I would

---------06:58----------
have no pads right now and if this was

---------07:01----------
an iPhone I'd be making less money think

---------07:05----------
people will ask me why don't you work on

---------07:06----------
that stuff well if my queue is filled

---------07:12----------
with this stuff and it pays better and

---------07:15----------
it's less of a pain in the dick why do

---------07:18----------
you why would you want me to work on an

---------07:20----------
iPhone again excuse me

---------07:23----------
like what is the what what is your

---------07:27----------
argument I you want me to be miserable

---------07:31----------
that is it nice try mofo nice try but I

---------07:39----------
don't want to be miserable I have no

---------07:42----------
desire I want to be happy

---------08:37----------
let's go

---------08:56----------
pushdown get this straight on the board

---------08:59----------
good do the same on the other side Zang

---------09:03----------
with the anchor push down get you

---------09:06----------
straight on the board

---------09:10----------
okay now that it's soldered you're gonna

---------09:13----------
push resolder make sure it's nice and

---------09:15----------
low and here's for the beautiful part

---------09:20----------
are you ready are you ready are you

---------09:24----------
ready this is the most fun part of the

---------09:29----------
entire job where I get to disobey every

---------09:32----------
single rule in the book on proper

---------09:34----------
soldering and still get a perfect

---------09:37----------
connector this is the fun part I love

---------09:40----------
this part

---------09:42----------
it never gets old i abs and okay here we

---------09:54----------
go

---------10:12----------
them and doctor gets in the way

---------10:16----------
coil it's always the coil coil

---------10:21----------
man

---------10:29----------
tries to ruin my day

---------10:45----------
okay now to do the anchor pins

---------10:57----------
be really careful with the front one

---------10:58----------
remember if the solder flows inside the

---------11:00----------
connector you lose okay next

---------11:27----------
okay and you defuse obviously I need a

---------11:31----------
backlight fuse so let's see it's loosen

---------11:37----------
you up bad

---------12:18----------
yowza

---------12:33----------
okay see I don't have any new fuses left

---------12:38----------
crap see what the do I wait to buy a new

---------12:45----------
one or do I grab one from a donor board

---------12:49----------
let's click around here okay according

---------12:54----------
to the notes he bitched and screamed

---------12:59----------
when we said that this repair would take

---------13:00----------
four hours

---------13:02----------
yeah certified pre-owned fuse for you

---------13:05----------
jackass okay certified pre-owned fuse

---------13:10----------
for you you are too important to wait

---------13:14----------
for this brand new ones that are coming

---------13:17----------
from Mouser tomorrow I love this

---------13:21----------
business you know have it you really

---------13:26----------
don't have the time to do okay

---------13:30----------
certified pre-owned views coming up

---------13:51----------
that's a little too certified preowned

---------13:53----------
for me that's not even certified okay

---------13:56----------
next that's certified burned that's mean

---------14:06----------
even for somebody according to the notes

---------14:09----------
here with a complete jackass that still

---------14:10----------
mean there's a line you know like I

---------14:18----------
treat people the way they treat me but

---------14:20----------
at the same time there's yeah you know

---------14:23----------
there's some things I won't give people

---------14:26----------
so if the fuse is black that is that's

---------14:31----------
just mean I'm not gonna do that

---------15:36----------
all right so now what I have to do is

---------15:38----------
get a screen that's not his to see if

---------15:41----------
this will give me a light image and all

---------15:43----------
that good stuff because I don't I don't

---------15:46----------
I don't trust this one for so I

---------15:49----------
turn the heat down on the welder to cool

---------15:50----------
it off this thing I like the weather

---------15:53----------
sometimes but there one of the things

---------15:55----------
that's really dumb is the thing is too

---------15:56----------
dumb to realize when you turn it off

---------15:58----------
that it needs to run the air for a while

---------15:59----------
so it doesn't overheat so with the

---------16:02----------
standard soldering iron when you turn it

---------16:03----------
off it just instantly turns off because

---------16:05----------
there's you know the element was heated

---------16:07----------
to the front you know the point to make

---------16:09----------
it 700 degrees and that's that now with

---------16:12----------
a hot-air station keep in mind that it's

---------16:14----------
heating itself the hot air station is

---------16:16----------
heating itself so that when there is air

---------16:18----------
blowing through at this much pressure

---------16:21----------
when there's coat you know the rooms

---------16:23----------
cold air blowing right through my hot

---------16:25----------
air that it'll be 700 degrees now when

---------16:28----------
you turn the air off immediately again

---------16:30----------
that little hot air that little a

---------16:32----------
heating element was meant to make the

---------16:34----------
air 700 Fahrenheit when there's air

---------16:36----------
blowing through it that's cold so when

---------16:38----------
you stop blowing that cold air through

---------16:39----------
it now the heating element is gonna go

---------16:41----------
eight hundred nine hundred a thousand

---------16:43----------
twelve under 2,000 it'll burn out so if

---------16:45----------
the thing had half a brain it

---------16:47----------
would know you know let me let me turn

---------16:49----------
when the guy says turn off how about I

---------16:53----------
stay on just running cold air through it

---------16:55----------
for a little while so I don't burn that

---------16:59----------
is not what the engineering genius is it

---------17:01----------
well or decided to do I can have this

---------17:03----------
thing set I could literally have this

---------17:04----------
thing set to 1000 degrees I can hit the

---------17:07----------
stop button and it instantly turns the

---------17:09----------
air off which will the rituals the

---------17:12----------
heating element six ways to Sunday all

---------17:15----------
right so oh I hate how short the MacBook

---------17:19----------
Air screen cable is no god this is

---------17:21----------
annoying as hell when it comes to

---------17:23----------
testing this is so annoying is

---------17:25----------
the I'm not the good one who's gonna be

---------17:27----------
replacing the screen cable Adi

---------17:29----------
this is what employees are for I do I do

---------17:31----------
this and then I do a look there's a

---------17:33----------
little drop-down tab and repair shopper

---------17:35----------
but I make replacing the cable and not

---------17:38----------
ripping the screen and all that

---------17:41----------
while you're getting the bezel off

---------17:43----------
somebody else's nightmare you know I've

---------17:47----------
done enough of these already

---------17:49----------
and if I'm gonna be doing all the boards

---------17:51----------
then I'm sure as not doing the rest

---------17:53----------
of all this stuff so let's see so I turn

---------17:55----------
it on and what do I get I get a fire I

---------17:58----------
know I get an RTC reason because this is

---------18:01----------
one of the turn on turn off turn on turn

---------18:04----------
off turn on turn off and then eventually

---------18:07----------
turn them let's see what I get did it

---------18:15----------
replace the inductor I never replaced

---------18:16----------
the inductor of course I get

---------18:18----------
nothing

---------18:18----------
dah all right that was dumb that was

---------18:23----------
really dumb so remember this little this

---------18:25----------
little inductor that I was supposed to

---------18:26----------
replace three or three volts to the LCD

---------18:30----------
really help if I actually put that on oh

---------18:33----------
yeah I bet this thing it works but the

---------18:35----------
screen would work so much better if was

---------18:36----------
getting three volts instead of zero okay

---------18:40----------
now I gotta wait for the weather to heat

---------18:42----------
up again Oh about this thing when I

---------18:46----------
first got it nothing about this that I

---------18:47----------
you know I'm noticing over time so you

---------18:49----------
notice how the hacker was actually

---------18:50----------
covered over here this section of it

---------18:52----------
right here is covered into that blue

---------18:53----------
stuff this one's not do you know what

---------18:55----------
happens when you put it near things it

---------18:57----------
burns them like your finger or your

---------18:59----------
hands or the top of your tweezers which

---------19:02----------
you're touching and then you touch the

---------19:04----------
tweezers in a bridge just this wasn't

---------19:07----------
really thought through very well but you

---------19:10----------
know these things that I didn't really

---------19:12----------
notice in the beginning but I kind of

---------19:13----------
noticed after extended usage I'm not

---------19:16----------
going back to the fr 801 because the fr

---------19:18----------
way to one is even less powerful in this

---------19:20----------
thing which I'm just yeah it's not that

---------19:24----------
the fr 801 was ever this amazing station

---------19:27----------
it was just that in a sea of it was

---------19:28----------
something I could use but I've kind of

---------19:34----------
graduated to wanting things like the JBC

---------19:36----------
like right now I'm removing a few I mean

---------19:39----------
this inductor right and I can feel that

---------19:41----------
my fingers are getting warmed up

---------19:44----------
incredibly because while it is shooting

---------19:46----------
the heat out it's also moving it

---------19:48----------
everywhere in the area including my hand

---------19:50----------
what what the

---------20:00----------
there's also no curved nozzles for this

---------20:02----------
either I mean the curved nozzles they

---------20:04----------
have like the you know the 1.8 or 2

---------20:06----------
millimeter ones but those ones are you

---------20:08----------
know that they're they're worthless you

---------20:10----------
need four six millimeters to actually

---------20:12----------
get any anything really going the hacker

---------20:16----------
doesn't have that either that JBC does

---------20:18----------
and the thing in the obvious you know

---------20:20----------
the problem with the GBC is that okay

---------20:21----------
that that's that's the hot air station

---------20:23----------
that's actually pretty decent but you

---------20:25----------
know it's $1,800 who's gonna buy a

---------20:27----------
 $1,800 hot air station anybody

---------20:30----------
who can afford to buy that is somebody

---------20:31----------
who can afford to this replace

---------20:32----------
everything for their customers instead

---------20:34----------
of fix it you know they good

---------20:37----------
that's a lot of money and I'm just

---------20:39----------
complaining while I'm waiting for this

---------20:40----------
thing to turn on nevermind me

---------20:42----------
okay so we plug it in and hopefully now

---------20:49----------
I can actually get power going to my

---------20:51----------
damn screen so it's gonna turn on and is

---------20:57----------
it gonna go on fire chime you muffle Oh

---------21:03----------
chimed whoa I see an apple and I see

---------21:09----------
other I see I see the name of the

---------21:12----------
person that I was just insulting and

---------21:14----------
calling in an [ __ ] hey I actually

---------21:16----------
didn't call them an [ __ ] I just said

---------21:18----------
it they're kind of acting like one so I

---------21:20----------
should probably cover that part but see

---------21:22----------
the Apple lit up so hopefully Billy you

---------21:24----------
believe me that there's a picture on the

---------21:26----------
screen that I can't really show you it

---------21:28----------
because it is that a login name okay and

---------21:31----------
that's that and I hope you learned

---------21:33----------
something
