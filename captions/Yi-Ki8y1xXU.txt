---------00:00----------
I got to meet a mentor of mine for the

---------00:01----------
first time a few days ago his name is

---------00:03----------
Duke he is from the Netherlands and we

---------00:05----------
met on a motherboard repair forum where

---------00:08----------
we discussed business and everything

---------00:09----------
about four and a half to five years ago

---------00:12----------
I wish we could say that we were on a

---------00:14----------
similar playing field but he is on an

---------00:16----------
entirely different level Duke is one of

---------00:18----------
those very rare 180 to 190 plus IQ

---------00:20----------
individuals who can do anything from

---------00:23----------
programming to BIOS hacking to

---------00:25----------
professional car repair to piloting an

---------00:28----------
airplane to fixing that airplane if it

---------00:30----------
has a problem to fixing 70 or old TVs

---------00:32----------
when you don't have schematics diagrams

---------00:33----------
or the parts available to them to being

---------00:36----------
best in class at MacBook component-level

---------00:38----------
board repair whatever it is you could

---------00:40----------
he's one of those people where you put

---------00:41----------
him on the desert island and he wouldn't

---------00:43----------
just build a coconut radio he would

---------00:45----------
build a coconut macbook he is just that

---------00:48----------
good and there are a few things that he

---------00:50----------
taught me that kept me in this business

---------00:52----------
and made it feel like what I did

---------00:54----------
actually mattered at times when I just

---------00:56----------
kind of wanted to give up and say screw

---------00:58----------
all this he taught me that following

---------01:00----------
please bro monkey-see monkey-do

---------01:02----------
solutions was the was not the way to

---------01:05----------
accomplish anything in life rather it's

---------01:07----------
to keep your third eye open to always be

---------01:10----------
thinking and analyzing and that it's not

---------01:12----------
as hard as everybody makes it out to be

---------01:13----------
if you're just thinking and analyzing

---------01:15----------
and always looking for answers to

---------01:17----------
problems then those answers will come to

---------01:20----------
you don't simply take the answers that

---------01:22----------
people deliver you just because they

---------01:23----------
deliver it to you and expect that it'll

---------01:25----------
work if you keep your third eye open

---------01:27----------
you'll see what everybody else missed

---------01:29----------
even the trillion dollar company the

---------01:31----------
second thing he taught me which was very

---------01:32----------
important is that it doesn't matter the

---------01:35----------
job that you have even if it is a

---------01:36----------
low-level

---------01:37----------
grimy job what matters is that you care

---------01:40----------
about it that you care about putting

---------01:42----------
things back together properly that you

---------01:43----------
care about things working properly that

---------01:45----------
you care about gaining a better

---------01:47----------
understanding of how everything works in

---------01:49----------
your particular field so that you can do

---------01:51----------
something even better every single day

---------01:54----------
regardless of how low you perceive your

---------01:56----------
craft to be take pride in it and it was

---------01:59----------
on those nights when it's 3:00 or 5:00

---------02:01----------
in the morning and I want to bang my

---------02:03----------
head against the wall because it's been

---------02:04----------
the tenth day in a row I've been trying

---------02:05----------
to solve a single problem that I was

---------02:08----------
inspired to keep trying at it and keep

---------02:11----------
moving forward as I listened to him

---------02:13----------
discuss how

---------02:13----------
he figured out this see 777 one defect

---------02:16----------
in the 2018 nine MacBook Pro how he

---------02:18----------
figured out the 2010 defect that causes

---------02:20----------
kernel panicking in the 2010 15 inch a

---------02:24----------
twelve eighty six how he figured out

---------02:25----------
that two thousand twelve a 1398 MacBook

---------02:28----------
Pro defect where you eighty nine hundred

---------02:30----------
comes desolder from the boarding courses

---------02:31----------
kernel panics how he figured out the two

---------02:33----------
thousand thirteen issue that would

---------02:35----------
result in them the eight two zero thirty

---------02:38----------
six sixty two boards randomly crashing I

---------02:41----------
give him credit because he figured all

---------02:43----------
these out on his own doing the same

---------02:45----------
thing that I'm trying to teach all of

---------02:46----------
you how to do which is hit your head

---------02:47----------
against the wall until 3:00 in the

---------02:50----------
morning looking at a diagram looking at

---------02:52----------
a circuit looking at a board thinking to

---------02:53----------
yourself if somebody else made this then

---------02:56----------
I can figure this out and so long as I

---------02:58----------
keep my eyes open even if I'm just a

---------03:00----------
normal person outfitted with normal

---------03:02----------
tools I can figure this out too Duke

---------03:04----------
doesn't use any fancy microscopes he

---------03:06----------
doesn't use a microscope at all he does

---------03:08----------
most of his hot air rework with a paint

---------03:10----------
stripper in spite of that he manages to

---------03:12----------
keep a very good income and a ridiculous

---------03:15----------
rate of turn of good repairs that go

---------03:18----------
through without Mooney requiring any

---------03:20----------
warranty work just because he's really

---------03:22----------
good at his job and and it was really

---------03:26----------
helpful to me to have a mentor like that

---------03:28----------
when I decided to switch over from doing

---------03:31----------
component level work on old audio gear

---------03:34----------
to component level rework on entirely

---------03:37----------
different systems and seeing that he was

---------03:39----------
successful at it and that he was going

---------03:40----------
through a lot of the same issues that I

---------03:42----------
would go through when I was trying to

---------03:43----------
figure out faults on new boards reminded

---------03:45----------
me that this is the right way to do it

---------03:48----------
this is the path to learning and this is

---------03:49----------
the path to success that and this is

---------03:52----------
what I should be showing everybody else

---------03:54----------
how to do so that hopefully you can all

---------03:57----------
share in the success that people like

---------03:58----------
Duke have had and just really excited

---------04:01----------
honored happy that he was able to visit

---------04:03----------
and I thought I'd share some of the the

---------04:05----------
boards that we worked on while he was

---------04:07----------
here so I just want to say thank you

---------04:08----------
very much to Duke for inspiring me to

---------04:10----------
keep doing what I'm doing and I can only

---------04:12----------
hope that what I'm doing is gonna keep

---------04:13----------
inspiring all seven hundred

---------04:14----------
thousand-plus of you to try and figure

---------04:18----------
things out like this as well and make

---------04:19----------
things work again for other people and

---------04:21----------
get people inspired to actually care

---------04:23----------
about their job however menial it is

---------04:26----------
because if every single person in the

---------04:28----------
world is put in a little bit more effort

---------04:29----------
to care about what it is they did and

---------04:32----------
doing it well then imagine how much

---------04:34----------
better the world could be for all of us

---------04:35----------
so with that said let's get on to the

---------04:37----------
video

---------04:38----------
can you see if my audios all right yeah

---------04:40----------
hello flex board view because he would

---------04:44----------
never use that never use anything other

---------04:46----------
than flex board view here it's the best

---------04:48----------
right absolutely the best you definitely

---------04:50----------
don't have land rekt still on your

---------04:51----------
computer no no no no that's already gone

---------04:53----------

---------04:58----------
picked at random [ __ ] [ __ ] this

---------05:01----------

---------05:16----------

---------10:53----------
the battery try this again someone said

---------10:56----------
your balls are showing really yeah

---------10:59----------
they're pretty huge but is your pp+ 8.1

---------11:02----------
or 8.5 well

---------11:05----------
we have a green light and it says 1.8

---------11:11----------
right now so we do not have PP bus and 3

---------11:18----------
volt 42 is also not present anymore so

---------11:33----------
really it works really this put this on

---------11:37----------
microscope really hold on what is look

---------11:42----------

---------12:01----------
little bit all right here we go we're

---------12:04----------
gonna try this again you know how hard

---------12:05----------
it is to find an actual 85 watt cable

---------12:07----------
yeah you go to the Apple store with a

---------12:10----------
pair of scissors and you just take one

---------12:13----------
like thanks that's what that's how they

---------12:16----------
do in the Netherlands yeah so we do have

---------12:18----------
a green light but there's no we do not

---------12:21----------
have three Vil 42

---------12:24----------
so it's disappeared like that yeah it

---------12:26----------
didn't work so let's investigate and

---------12:31----------
let's rip someone oh it turned on again

---------12:33----------
oh it's Hunt haunted honking shall we

---------12:39----------
yeah first disconnect the SSD before we

---------12:41----------
corrupt this this man's data I'm gonna

---------12:48----------
click shut down Chris long hey dude Oh

---------12:51----------
mr. mee

---------12:52----------
yeah I've missed your videos man I've

---------12:53----------
seen you did a tuna one since like

---------12:55----------
recently but I miss I miss your videos

---------12:58----------
there were always like I like the long

---------13:00----------
streams so some people don't like long

---------13:04----------
streams but I like just like a

---------13:06----------
three-hour stream of just doing random

---------13:09----------
[ __ ] as I enjoy that so Oh somebody

---------13:15----------
replace the cable

---------13:17----------
is it upside down No thank God and all I

---------13:20----------
think they tried everything on this

---------13:23----------
thing and then like call it a day

---------13:25----------
was that you really I don't believe it

---------13:35----------
it's Lois I don't I don't trust him I

---------13:40----------
don't think I really have time to read a

---------13:43----------
stream the DC board has been out and of

---------13:56----------
course the camera cable is wired wrong

---------13:59----------
and the headphone jack is not in the

---------14:03----------
that worries me so it's we oh yeah we

---------14:11----------
don't have like a look at that

---------14:14----------
well let's go down but yeah this is this

---------14:18----------
is all the random or older classic sorry

---------14:22----------
in the class oh hold on

---------14:23----------
do we have long fan long screw damage

---------14:26----------
yes we have Wu long can you see that

---------14:32----------
that long a screw right there straight

---------14:35----------
into this poor little hole and the short

---------14:40----------
one is yeah oh yeah this one yeah this

---------14:46----------
one doesn't kill anything but yeah

---------14:55----------
[Music]

---------14:57----------
all righty and there's board and of

---------15:08----------
course the shields are bent on the

---------15:10----------
thunderbolt port as usual now what who

---------15:20----------
what where Louis

---------15:29----------
it's a refurb board I think we already

---------15:32----------
know what this one's going they're an

---------15:36----------
apple oh how do you tell when it's a

---------15:38----------
refurb board from Apple well it's got

---------15:40----------
this nice little sticker on it with the

---------15:42----------
part number 613 ein yeah you can see

---------15:46----------
this sticker it's got the part number on

---------15:48----------
it like six three nine zero zero six

---------15:51----------
three something so this has been a

---------15:54----------
replaced board from Apple so that sucks

---------16:04----------
stop you can fix it

---------16:08----------
oh yeah it's like Mort this is gonna be

---------16:12----------
the right to [ __ ] it up and then dump it

---------16:14----------
dump it on my pile the right to [ __ ] up

---------16:22----------
your MacBook I think we already have

---------16:24----------
that I think a lot of people are

---------16:26----------
exercising their right to [ __ ] up their

---------16:27----------
MacBooks there's no issues with that so

---------16:31----------
this yeah so this is an apple refer

---------16:35----------
board and that generally sucks bud it

---------16:41----------
does have a PP 3v how do you call that

---------16:46----------
PP 3 V 4 3 V 4 2 volt issue so there may

---------16:51----------
there may be hope because that's that's

---------16:56----------
kind of basic so we might get away with

---------16:58----------
this Apple refer board here okay so

---------17:01----------
we're gonna I'm out of frame so I am

---------17:06----------
connected right now and

---------17:09----------
do we have 342 of course we do this

---------17:14----------
sucks

---------17:18----------
and do we have V Corps yes we do so the

---------17:23----------
board is actually on right now yeah

---------17:26----------
great

---------17:29----------
how do we make this turn off you really

---------17:37----------
have you have you messes with this one

---------17:40----------
or is this is this is a genuine like I

---------17:42----------
just straight out the pile so it so it

---------17:53----------
we could still have a parts problem

---------18:02----------
epple replaced everything because their

---------18:04----------
their original parts this is an original

---------18:06----------
part this is not a china flat cable

---------18:21----------
so neither disagree the elephant is the

---------18:28----------
15/16

---------18:35----------
so shall we give this a look over with

---------18:40----------
the microscope see how what kind of

---------18:42----------
quality Apple is given our course

---------18:45----------
they're customers here we go

---------18:49----------
so so it works at home without a

---------18:52----------
microscope I wasn't I do without a

---------18:55----------
microscope yes huh yeah tell us good

---------19:01----------
yeah I don't need no microscope so this

---------19:03----------
is uh hold on let me turn this around

---------19:05----------
you can see the the dreaded upside down

---------19:10----------
the dreaded label of doom there you go

---------19:14----------
the dreaded label of Apple refurb Board

---------19:18----------
of doom

---------19:19----------
and it's a more stickiness right here

---------19:23----------
there used to be a label right there

---------19:25----------
they used to be a label right there so I

---------19:30----------
honestly think this thing has not been

---------19:34----------
messed with after the bar it was

---------19:37----------
replaced by Apple so this is uh so Apple

---------19:42----------
is the one that put the wires in

---------19:43----------
backwards maybe yeah no I don't think so

---------19:47----------
well you may be how the hell do you work

---------19:52----------
without a microscope I would never be

---------19:54----------
able to work without mines ah my eyes

---------19:58----------
are still pretty okay so

---------20:05----------
yeah you should be

---------20:07----------
played with a question

---------20:12----------
okay so we do have a threefold 42 issue

---------20:15----------
so let's look around the regulator right

---------20:21----------
here a little bit what's going on here

---------20:29----------
it's not even looking in the microscope

---------20:30----------
he's looking at the tiny window on the

---------20:32----------
screen oh can I can look through the

---------20:33----------
sing oh oh your eyes that close together

---------20:36----------
yeah here we go

---------20:38----------
oh I I don't have these luxuries I don't

---------20:41----------
know this is how this helps us work it's

---------20:45----------
like the third or fourth water reading

---------20:46----------
you haven't killed anything

---------20:54----------
so we're gonna put some caps missing no

---------20:59----------
those are no stuff yeah there are no

---------21:00----------
stuff those the year that's all right

---------21:12----------
look at this look at this look at this

---------21:15----------
what is that

---------21:16----------
Oh hold on I'm out of what

---------21:28----------
what is going on here what is going on

---------21:32----------
there what is that I very much doubt

---------21:36----------
that but it's not gonna cause a 3-volt

---------21:39----------
42 issue but this is definitely Apple

---------21:46----------
sold you a bridge there definitely that

---------21:48----------
is [ __ ]

---------21:50----------
wait because the issue was it was

---------21:51----------
randomly turning off yeah but turns it

---------21:53----------
on then I randomly turned off yeah but

---------21:55----------
this one is this is this is like a

---------21:56----------
secondary rail so it killed three volts

---------22:02----------
42 so it just killed everything mmm I

---------22:06----------
don't wanna meet let me tell you this

---------22:08----------
that so this was a this was a flake of

---------22:14----------
solder oh well where was a flake of

---------22:21----------
aluminum from the case I don't know

---------22:23----------
something um it's bit out of focus can

---------22:32----------
you tell I'm doing this for the first

---------22:34----------
time what a microscope

---------22:41----------
how is the reset chip doing

---------22:57----------
it looks okay

---------23:00----------
we may actually have fixed it because

---------23:03----------
that yeah that that looked really

---------23:07----------
suspicious right there so long screw

---------23:24----------
actually I'm green soda says you're

---------23:26----------
doing better than Jessica okay well

---------23:28----------
that's not Wow I don't think I've seen

---------23:33----------
that stream it won't announce you when

---------23:35----------
that who won't this may be fixed right

---------23:38----------
now because of the the flake was kind of

---------23:40----------
what was the flake

---------23:46----------
where was it I think I think that is the

---------23:50----------
three volt regulator now you since Duke

---------23:56----------
uses flex board view every day I'm sure

---------23:59----------
he's gonna know how to show you this on

---------24:01----------
the software he's gonna know how to

---------24:02----------
bring it up in the PDF immediately how

---------24:04----------
about see cuz he never he stopped using

---------24:07----------
land wrecks test length two and a half

---------24:09----------
years ago of course I did yeah yeah can

---------24:12----------
I already double click this like land

---------24:14----------
wrecks no no to zoom in okay oh there we

---------24:20----------
go so uh let me let me have a look here

---------24:23----------
this is a it's this one

---------24:27----------
and yeah that's the vibe five volts

---------24:31----------
which were the two pins they were

---------24:33----------
shorter

---------24:35----------
these two so the high side and the low

---------24:40----------
side the both driving oh you can click

---------24:43----------
them here those are both gates the both

---------24:46----------
the two gates

---------24:47----------
I bet the pin pin three and five then or

---------24:51----------
three and four also Gaiden gate and face

---------24:54----------
so what would be the results if those

---------24:57----------
two pins were shorter but this would be

---------24:59----------
bad actually because that would double

---------25:01----------
that would that could potentially send

---------25:04----------
pp bus straight to five volt if you turn

---------25:08----------
on this FET then yeah cuz because the

---------25:17----------
low side FET would would kick in and

---------25:19----------
short the whole thing out if it's fast

---------25:22----------
enough and if it's not fast enough the

---------25:25----------
board is very dead so I don't know this

---------25:29----------
this may actually cuz what did to take

---------25:32----------
it say it just just shuts off randomly

---------25:34----------
yes random they said doesn't power on at

---------25:39----------
all you got it to turn on but then it

---------25:41----------
turned off like 10 seconds later so you

---------25:43----------
just made up the ticket oh you mean like

---------25:50----------
oh well then I'll shall we just lose

---------25:57----------
this thing's a mess

---------26:04----------
it is a mess
