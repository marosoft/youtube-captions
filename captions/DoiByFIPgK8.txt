---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we've got an ancient old a 1278 MacBook

---------00:04----------
that's not powering on let's open this

---------00:06----------
thing up and see if we could figure out

---------00:07----------
what's wrong with it

---------00:08----------
oh my god you're an 8 - 0 - 28 79 Core 2

---------00:17----------
Duo with an MCP 89 Jesus this thing is

---------00:21----------
old

---------00:22----------
by the way if he if you can't see the

---------00:23----------
h20 there's 2879

---------00:25----------
you might just have some problems with

---------00:27----------
your vision see it's right over here see

---------00:32----------
that 8 - 0 28 79 clear as day you should

---------00:37----------
be able to read that very easily if

---------00:39----------
you're having problems with that you

---------00:41----------
might just have problems of eating in

---------00:42----------
this business see that 8 - 0 28 79 the

---------00:48----------
no green light on the charger so let's

---------00:51----------
see what happens if we try to turn it on

---------00:53----------
manually using the power pads and it

---------00:57----------
doesn't look like we get anything all

---------01:01----------
right so let's check out the one wire

---------01:02----------
circuit on this

---------01:11----------
mm-hmm and it's supposed to be 3.3 volts

---------01:15----------
3.42 volts on that ship over there

---------01:18----------
that's 5,400 rpm pseudo beams 5400 rpm

---------01:28----------
see that ep 3 before 2 is not present

---------01:35----------
where it's needs to be

---------01:58----------
let's remove the borscht from the case

---------02:02----------
this has a nice pretty simple little one

---------02:05----------
wire circuit so for the one wire circuit

---------02:07----------
to work I need PP through before to

---------02:08----------
undersquare g3 hot to be present PP 30

---------02:10----------
before to underscore g3 hot is created

---------02:12----------
by u 6990 u 6990 is gonna be right over

---------02:16----------
here so let's just check out this one

---------02:19----------
wire circuit isn't this beautiful

---------02:20----------
you have your DC power jack over here

---------02:23----------
that has three lines 18 volts 18 volts

---------02:28----------
ground adapter sense the after sense is

---------02:34----------
going to go to this chip now this chip

---------02:36----------
serves as the body guard to the system

---------02:38----------
management controller which is what

---------02:40----------
talks to the charger on the system one

---------02:42----------
wire line if you are drunk

---------02:44----------
and you plug this in magnetic connector

---------02:45----------
in sideways so that 18 volts goes to

---------02:48----------
adapter sense this says oh hell no I'm

---------02:51----------
not letting 18 volt into the SMC gtfo

---------02:53----------
but if it's the 3 volt data line then it

---------02:56----------
lets it speak to the SMC this chip is

---------02:58----------
powered by this chip and this chip is

---------02:59----------
powered by pp 3 or 4 200 g3 hot if s MC

---------03:02----------
bc AC ok is present on pins a and B over

---------03:04----------
here it sends 53 before to underscore g3

---------03:06----------
hot over to this chip which allows the

---------03:07----------
adapter sense line on the charger to

---------03:09----------
communicate with the SMC which allows it

---------03:10----------
all to turn on but in order for that to

---------03:12----------
work you need PP 3 or 4 to underscore g3

---------03:14----------
hot which is why we're gonna take a look

---------03:15----------
at the u 6990 circuit and see what's

---------03:17----------
going on with this board now in order

---------03:19----------
for that to work you need voltage on pin

---------03:20----------
6 for it to turn on right over there

---------03:23----------
that's going to be the power from the

---------03:25----------
charger so let's see on the board what

---------03:27----------
happens if we measure over there okay so

---------03:29----------
I have 0 volts there which means

---------03:30----------
nothing's going through alright so let's

---------03:32----------
follow that back alright 6905 is back

---------03:39----------
here

---------03:43----------
let's see we have on each side of our

---------03:46----------
6905

---------03:55----------
0:17 huh this is zero

---------04:01----------
seventeen zero okay you get the idea

---------04:05----------
what's going on here now I'm not gonna

---------04:07----------
replace that resistor without trying to

---------04:08----------
figure out why it failed first first

---------04:10----------
thing wouldn't do is see if there's a

---------04:11----------
short to ground after it and ninety ohms

---------04:16----------
that's not right ma'am

---------04:18----------
that's not right so there is most likely

---------04:21----------
a short to ground somewhere here so

---------04:23----------
let's go back to our schematic and board

---------04:27----------
you now where could this possibly be

---------04:28----------
sure you have two possibilities it could

---------04:30----------
be only two things right you have either

---------04:32----------
a you 6990 or B this capacitor ground

---------04:36----------
it's the only two ways that this thing

---------04:37----------
can be short to ground the only two ways

---------04:39----------
now it could be technically a short on

---------04:41----------
output of pp three or four too but that

---------04:43----------
is yeah that's that's not even remotely

---------04:46----------
there it's open line also by the way

---------04:48----------
look at this they can't even draw their

---------04:50----------
lines right so instead of having those

---------04:51----------
line in the schematic 118 volt going to

---------04:54----------
voltage in the other going to the

---------04:55----------
shutdown pin they're both going to the

---------04:57----------
shutdown pin and voltage in is just

---------04:58----------
going nowhere they couldn't just make

---------05:00----------
the line go from here to here and this

---------05:03----------
this is really important and the reason

---------05:04----------
I'm pointing this out is if they can't

---------05:06----------
even proofread the schematic diagram

---------05:08----------
that says how the machine is built how

---------05:10----------
the [ __ ] can you trust that they're

---------05:11----------
actually building a machine that's made

---------05:12----------
to last when I go over all the design

---------05:15----------
flaws over the past 11 12 13 years of

---------05:17----------
Apple products and I talked about how

---------05:18----------
their their designs are unfit I just

---------05:21----------
want you to think about this that the

---------05:22----------
final documentation that says how this

---------05:24----------
product is put together is actually

---------05:27----------
wrong in the last video that I did I was

---------05:29----------
talking about how they can't even get

---------05:31----------
right the voltage that goes to their RAM

---------05:33----------
is at 0.35 volts or 0.67 five volts for

---------05:35----------
DDR vtt do they use an ISO six two five

---------05:38----------
eight and is L six two five nine or an

---------05:40----------
ISO nine three three nine and here they

---------05:42----------
can't even get the lines that show how

---------05:44----------
things are drawn together properly I

---------05:45----------
just want you to think about that

---------05:46----------
because this product when it came out

---------05:48----------
was priced as a premium product you have

---------05:51----------
to remember the a 1278 MacBook all the

---------05:53----------
way in late 2015 they were selling a

---------05:56----------
dual-core ivory Bridge machine with

---------05:58----------
about four gigs of RAM 5400 rpm spinning

---------06:02----------
hard drive for a thousand $49

---------06:06----------
they can't even draw the lines right I'm

---------06:08----------
just saying anyway so we it looks like

---------06:10----------
we have a short and it's going to be

---------06:11----------
either the cap or that so see six nine

---------06:14----------
nine nine takes c6 9 9 0 or the chip now

---------06:19----------
I'm gonna guess that it's the cap

---------06:22----------
because that is corroded whereas the

---------06:24----------
chip looks kind of fine so we're gonna

---------06:26----------
have to find ourselves a donor 8 - 0 -

---------06:28----------
28 79 because I don't think my donor

---------06:31----------
caps bin goes up to 805 in size so we're

---------06:36----------
just gonna knock that cap off the board

---------06:37----------
we may not actually even need that cab

---------06:39----------
just look just just sayin so let's see

---------06:41----------
what happens if you just knock that cap

---------06:42----------
off the board if we get anything funky

---------06:45----------
happening

---------06:46----------
[Music]

---------07:01----------
according to my monitor it says that my

---------07:03----------
iron is 840 degrees but this is not

---------07:05----------
acting like it's 840 degrees okay there

---------07:08----------
we go

---------07:08----------
I'm gonna get some tip cleaner it's

---------07:12----------
always important to clean your tip you

---------07:14----------
gotta find something to clean your tip

---------07:16----------
every now and then if your girlfriend

---------07:18----------
leaves and you don't know when she's

---------07:19----------
coming back helps to have something else

---------07:21----------
to stick your tip into especially if it

---------07:23----------
promises that it's gonna clean your tip

---------07:26----------
all right there we go so you don't want

---------07:30----------
to dip your tip in too long just you

---------07:31----------
know 10-15 seconds and then after the

---------07:38----------
10-15 seconds in there we're gonna go

---------07:40----------
over to the hakko $5.99 B and clean it

---------07:46----------
up and then if you're a real savage

---------07:51----------
while your girlfriend is watching and

---------07:53----------
chat you can stick the tip in oh yeah oh

---------07:59----------
oh that is so satisfying and when you're

---------08:05----------
done sticking the tip and every now and

---------08:07----------
then it's good to smoke all right you

---------08:08----------
know for some people once they're done

---------08:10----------
sticking the tip and they'll just allow

---------08:11----------
it to smoke for a little bit right after

---------08:13----------
they're done kind of relaxes them you

---------08:14----------
know see that she's a little bit of

---------08:17----------
smoke just to help you relax

---------09:33----------
hmm okay have the multimeter in ohms

---------09:37----------
mode so we went from 90 ohms to ground

---------09:43----------
on that area to now about a hundred

---------09:46----------
seventy thousand ohms to ground so I'm

---------09:48----------
gonna say that the cap was the problem

---------09:51----------
and not the chip so he did guess

---------09:52----------
properly and that was a guess because it

---------09:59----------
was one of the other I now I made the

---------10:01----------
guess based on some information and it's

---------10:03----------
better to have a guess based on

---------10:04----------
information than a guest is based on a

---------10:06----------
guess but that guess was based on the

---------10:08----------
fact that the chip was not at all

---------10:10----------
corroded whereas the capacitor seriously

---------10:14----------
obviously was once we restore pp three

---------10:19----------
or four to one to score g3 hot on this

---------10:20----------
machine we should expect this beautiful

---------10:23----------
Core 2 Duo masterpiece to return to

---------10:26----------
functionality

---------10:48----------
so now I'm gonna try to do this without

---------10:49----------
a hot-air station so what I do let's

---------10:53----------
just say I didn't have a hot-air station

---------10:54----------
available to me but you could do over

---------10:56----------
there is you could just solder one pad

---------10:58----------
rather than both pads

---------11:11----------
then you take your iron

---------11:35----------
Quora to small max are more stable than

---------11:37----------
modern t2 chip max for various real-time

---------11:39----------
professional apps audio less crashes

---------11:41----------
latency you know can you email me an

---------11:44----------
article on that I may not be able to

---------11:46----------
respond to you exactly but I just don't

---------11:47----------
want to forget about - about looking

---------11:49----------
into that I'd be really interested to

---------11:50----------
understand or gain an understanding of

---------11:53----------
what it is if anything that makes a t2

---------11:56----------
chip MacBook more unstable or have more

---------11:59----------
latency when it comes to real-time audio

---------12:02----------
and video applications

---------12:03----------
very curious thank you very much for

---------12:06----------
taking the time so we are gonna replace

---------12:10----------
our capacitor

---------12:11----------
since water got over here just gonna

---------12:13----------
give our chip a little bit of a a little

---------12:17----------
bit of rehab and put that cap back where

---------12:22----------
it should be since I knocked it off I

---------12:25----------
wasn't very nice of me to knock that

---------12:27----------
campus sitter off

---------12:33----------
no this is the hot air

---------12:42----------
you have a legitimate gripe átheir legit

---------12:45----------
hello

---------12:46----------
most of them will be because of I mean

---------12:49----------
even we have trouble finding nose

---------12:50----------
actually especially a 1417 it's a bit of

---------12:53----------
a nightmare for us right now

---------13:25----------
I've always wanted of New York Pizza is

---------13:27----------
really that good says margarita doctor

---------13:29----------
no pizza in general is crap there are so

---------13:32----------
many things if there are millions of

---------13:34----------
things that are better to eat than pizza

---------13:36----------
I don't even mean better for you I mean

---------13:38----------
better as in they just taste better they

---------13:40----------
are better New York City Pizza sucks

---------13:42----------
it's the kind of stuff where you pick it

---------13:44----------
up and it just flops it's like good and

---------13:46----------
then people say well you have to fold

---------13:48----------
that you don't understand you're using

---------13:49----------
it wrong they Apple you when it comes to

---------13:51----------
New York Pizza you're using it wrong you

---------13:53----------
need to fold it cuz I'm supposed to funk

---------13:55----------
origami my food after I pay for it in

---------13:58----------
order to be able to put it in my mouth

---------13:59----------
great but then when you fold it it's

---------14:01----------
Sophie oily that once you folded it

---------14:04----------
instead of the oil staying here it just

---------14:06----------
starts to go out like a spigot onto your

---------14:08----------
plate and it never stops it just keeps

---------14:10----------
going and going and going it's

---------14:12----------
disgusting I can't believe people eat

---------14:14----------
that [ __ ] voluntarily disgusting but

---------14:17----------
let's replace the resister

---------14:27----------
they got rid of the cause of the short

---------14:28----------
but I never replaced the resistor that

---------14:30----------
blew

---------15:43----------
how do you have forty nine thousand

---------15:44----------
subscribers here in 1.50 five million

---------15:46----------
your other channel lopsided a little I

---------15:48----------
would argue with you that I don't have

---------15:50----------
one point zero five million on my other

---------15:52----------
channel if I post a normal bit like a

---------15:54----------
border pair video it usually gets about

---------15:56----------
20,000 views if I posed an interesting

---------15:59----------
border pair video maybe it'll get thirty

---------16:02----------
or forty thousand views if I post a

---------16:04----------
video about an issue that I think is

---------16:05----------
interesting or important

---------16:06----------
it'll get fifty forty to fifty thousand

---------16:09----------
views if I post something that's crazy

---------16:11----------
viral then the crazy viral video will

---------16:15----------
get 80 to 120 thousand views so I don't

---------16:19----------
think I actually have a million

---------16:20----------
subscribers I don't know how YouTube's

---------16:22----------
rates that stuff I don't know how that

---------16:24----------
works

---------16:24----------
but that does not seem to be even

---------16:27----------
remotely accurate I would say that the

---------16:30----------
number of subscribers are having a live

---------16:31----------
channel is actually closer to my real

---------16:34----------
following there we go so again one of

---------16:40----------
the things I like to do is I try to show

---------16:42----------
you what it would be like if I didn't

---------16:43----------
have a hot-air station we we wick the

---------16:46----------
solder we solder one side and I use now

---------16:49----------
remember I have you typically you're

---------16:51----------
supposed to be adding solder as you have

---------16:53----------
the soldering iron there you don't just

---------16:54----------
have the starter stay stagnant or OC a

---------16:56----------
crappy joints but I need the tweezer to

---------16:58----------
push it down and this the solder with so

---------17:00----------
I add flux before I saw her and adding

---------17:04----------
the flux before I solder to make sure

---------17:05----------
that I get a nice pretty joint out of it

---------17:07----------
which is what we did there so now we

---------17:12----------
should have a happy little green light

---------17:29----------
all right we have 30 milliamp usage my

---------17:33----------
resistor is not smoking let's see if I

---------17:36----------
get a fan spin do I get a fan spin I

---------17:42----------
probably don't get a fan spin because

---------17:43----------
this board is from 2010 yeah you're not

---------17:49----------
gonna give me a fan spin are you

---------17:57----------
so we're gonna show it to power on pads

---------17:59----------
no offense but and you're stuck at 24

---------18:03----------
million oh the sadness

---------18:12----------
huh here we go you have a green light

---------18:14----------
now Oh

---------18:16----------
fans been ok look at this board look at

---------18:19----------
the amp usage damn and a 1502 takes five

---------18:23----------
to six hundred milliamps the air takes

---------18:24----------
five to six hundred milliamps this thing

---------18:26----------
takes a full amp this thing takes almost

---------18:29----------
as much as the as the 15-inch retina

---------18:31----------
booting out the machine that has a

---------18:34----------
dedicated graphics card that's powerful

---------18:36----------
and the quad-core CPU takes about almost

---------18:39----------
the same like a little bit more amperage

---------18:41----------
than this piece of [ __ ] takes to turn on

---------18:42----------
Wow and the reason I have to do that is

---------18:45----------
these ones these don't turn on

---------18:46----------
automatically SMC on-off l pads actually

---------18:48----------
have to be shorted in order for that to

---------18:50----------
turn on and I had to scrape them because

---------18:51----------
they were so junky because they're so

---------18:53----------
old that they weren't responding to my

---------18:55----------
tweezer but yeah as you can see there we

---------18:57----------
have a green light and it does turn on

---------18:59----------
so let's just go over the lesson here

---------19:02----------
because a similar circuit to this is

---------19:04----------
still used in newer machines no we were

---------19:08----------
not getting a green light there was no

---------19:12----------
green light and first thing you got to

---------19:16----------
do to get the green light up take a look

---------19:18----------
at your one wire circuit the one wire

---------19:21----------
circuit is gonna be where you have

---------19:23----------
adapter sense that is the sense line

---------19:26----------
from the charger that's the kind of like

---------19:27----------
the brain of the charger this is where

---------19:29----------
the charger plugs in by the way MagSafe

---------19:30----------
DC power jack that's gonna speak to this

---------19:33----------
chip this chip is then going to allow

---------19:35----------
the charger to speak to the system

---------19:36----------
management controller which needs to

---------19:37----------
happen to in order to get a green light

---------19:39----------
this chip is gonna turn on if it has

---------19:41----------
powered its VCC pin typically the pin at

---------19:43----------
the top or anything when you see VCC VDD

---------19:46----------
V in that's voltage in that it needs to

---------19:50----------
have three-point 42 volts that's gonna

---------19:51----------
come from this chip and this chips gonna

---------19:52----------
get that from PB 3 or 2 so that rail has

---------19:55----------
to be present this rail wasn't present I

---------19:57----------
looked at voltage in that wasn't present

---------20:00----------
so I went back over here this was not

---------20:02----------
present then I went back over to here

---------20:03----------
and I had 17 volts but I had 0 volts

---------20:05----------
here but at 17 volts there and 0 volts

---------20:07----------
here so what I did was I checked to see

---------20:09----------
if there's a short-circuit over here I

---------20:11----------
did and I saw there was 92 ohms it was

---------20:13----------
either the cap or this that was gonna be

---------20:15----------
shorted to ground the capacitor was

---------20:16----------
corroded the chip wasn't so I replaced

---------20:19----------
the capacitor and the short was gone

---------20:20----------
then I replaced the resistor because the

---------20:22----------
short was no longer there and it worked

---------20:23----------
how do I simply replace the broken

---------20:25----------
resistor

---------20:26----------
and left that capacitor there which is

---------20:27----------
what many people do in a fuse blows

---------20:28----------
let's just replace the views just reset

---------20:31----------
the circuit breaker without figuring out

---------20:32----------
why it blew it would have smoked and

---------20:34----------
blew again but it didn't blow again as

---------20:36----------
you can see we have a fan spin and we

---------20:39----------
have a green light so that is fixed well

---------20:42----------
that's it for today thank you so much

---------20:44----------
for watching viewing taking part in

---------20:46----------
everything we do hopefully you learn

---------20:47----------
something that you can use to revive one

---------20:49----------
of these old machines I am kidding as

---------20:50----------
much as I like to just bash on it

---------20:53----------
because it's an MCP 89 machine and I

---------20:55----------
have a personal vendetta with these for

---------20:57----------
the frequency at which the mCP 89 would

---------20:59----------
just die I am you know it's it's good to

---------21:02----------
make it work again because as we can say

---------21:05----------
what we want but there's people out

---------21:06----------
there that probably couldn't afford a

---------21:07----------
better computer than what you have over

---------21:09----------
here and it's better that it works in a

---------21:11----------
dozen regardless of how slow this is

---------21:14----------
this has more value in a working machine

---------21:16----------
than it does in a dumpster and app

---------21:18----------
companies like Apple would prefer that

---------21:20----------
when something like this happens that

---------21:22----------
this wind up in a waste this little

---------21:24----------
robot Liam take it apart and just

---------21:25----------
recycle it to nothing but I think what

---------21:28----------
would be better is if people like you

---------21:29----------
watching use these videos learn from

---------21:32----------
them really understand what's going on

---------21:33----------
