---------00:00----------
hi so today Apple decided to make my

---------00:02----------
life just a little bit harder like they

---------00:04----------
always do by giving customers a shitty

---------00:05----------
estimates so they told a customer that

---------00:08----------
this machine only needed a screen and

---------00:10----------
then the guy calls and says Apple said I

---------00:11----------
needed a screen how long is it gonna

---------00:13----------
take and we say if it's a screen one

---------00:15----------
hour but we like to do our own estimate

---------00:17----------
because they are often wrong and this is

---------00:19----------
this guy was you know it was a douchebag

---------00:21----------
so he he hung up before we could

---------00:23----------
actually finish the [ __ ] sentence now

---------00:25----------
I have to sleep sensor unplugged and

---------00:27----------
this computer is on so one of the things

---------00:28----------
that I want to show you here is why it

---------00:30----------
won't work with another screen and why

---------00:32----------
it drives me nuts when they do their own

---------00:34----------
bullshit-ass estimates so when you get

---------00:36----------
what you're gonna see over here is you

---------00:38----------
only get 17 volts on backlight now tell

---------00:45----------
me how the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] gonna work

---------00:47----------
with the new screen when you're only

---------00:49----------
sending 17 volts of the screen it's not

---------00:51----------
it's not a screen I plugged in a new

---------00:53----------
screen it didn't work and the guy's

---------00:54----------
going on how am I supposed to live three

---------00:55----------
to five days without my laptop you said

---------00:58----------
who would live three to five days

---------00:59----------
without their laptop my answer is if you

---------01:02----------
have a dead motherboard like what what

---------01:03----------
are you gonna do it this is the e you

---------01:05----------
can't use it I mean really and yeah I

---------01:08----------
don't I don't tell people same day even

---------01:09----------
if it is a backlight because why make

---------01:12----------
the Y make life a nightmare hell for

---------01:14----------
yourself so we're gonna go through

---------01:15----------
fixing this uh I'm gonna show you what I

---------01:18----------
do so let's just turn it off turn it

---------01:20----------
back on again and first thing to do here

---------01:24----------
is take some measurements and check out

---------01:27----------
why this is messing up so first things

---------01:29----------
first since we have that voltage on

---------01:30----------
backlight obviously the fuse is good if

---------01:32----------
the fuse were blown you would not have

---------01:33----------
17 volts on output or 12 or anything now

---------01:36----------
the fact that it's 17 it's the lowest

---------01:38----------
amount that it would go through while

---------01:40----------
boosting is occurring so we're gonna go

---------01:42----------
through and make sure that everything

---------01:44----------
here measures the way it's supposed to

---------01:45----------
so the first thing to go through here on

---------01:48----------
the screen is going to be backlight and

---------01:50----------
able so backlight enable is right over

---------01:53----------
here and that has to work that has to be

---------01:57----------
3 volts that's not the revolts we won't

---------01:59----------
get what we need so let's check

---------02:03----------
backlight a navel

---------02:19----------
three volts

---------02:21----------
okay so backlight enable is there and

---------02:23----------
the next thing to check since it's

---------02:24----------
telling it to actually turn the

---------02:25----------
backlight on is the PWM signal so the

---------02:27----------
pullet pwm signal is what tells the

---------02:29----------
Machine what brightness to set so if the

---------02:34----------
PWM signal is too low or not present

---------02:36----------
it's not going to turn the brightness up

---------02:37----------
even if the LED booth circuit is

---------02:40----------
actually working so we're gonna turn on

---------02:43----------
the oscilloscope and let's see what we

---------02:44----------
get over there let's try to move this

---------02:49----------
that you can actually see it it's oom a

---------02:53----------
little bit on that

---------02:54----------
alrighty and we're gonna measure and

---------03:03----------
what the hell just for fun I'll even

---------03:04----------
show you what I'm measuring let's get

---------03:07----------
microscope yeah I don't have the voltage

---------03:20----------
here set right so we're gonna set it to

---------03:21----------
one volt

---------03:22----------
so we can actually see what the PWM

---------03:24----------
looks like this this obviously means I

---------03:28----------
haven't touched the ground properly

---------04:06----------
all sadly the ground probe to my

---------04:09----------
oscilloscope finally broke and him hit

---------04:12----------
the bucket which is why that looks like

---------04:13----------
complete and utter [ __ ] that's not what

---------04:15----------
that's supposed to look like so that's

---------04:16----------
just another day in me trying to do a

---------04:18----------
video and it not working so I the ground

---------04:21----------
they don't even get a difference anyway

---------04:23----------
but I see what I need to see so pretty

---------04:25----------
much even though that that is a complete

---------04:26----------
pile of [ __ ] I can tell that there's

---------04:28----------
actually a PWM signal which means that

---------04:30----------
the light should be on which leads me to

---------04:33----------
probably bad LED driver so great it's

---------04:41----------
gonna go on to replace the LED driver

---------05:29----------
the other LED drivers are exactly where

---------05:32----------
they're supposed to be in a little pouch

---------05:33----------
on the floor under my desk under a cable

---------05:57----------
an important thing to take note of here

---------05:58----------
is that this LED driver is oriented

---------06:00----------
differently on different boards so it's

---------06:02----------
important that you remember the way it's

---------06:03----------
oriented obviously if you put it on the

---------06:06----------
wrong way bad bad things happening

---------07:23----------
this is the wrong soldering tip for the

---------07:25----------
job I should be using the flat one I

---------07:26----------
just don't feel like changing it and

---------07:29----------
this is so small an area that it's not

---------07:32----------
worth changing the tip for the cleaning

---------07:34----------
I'll be able to do a perfect job without

---------07:38----------
this is

---------08:01----------
I'm out of q-tips so I'm using a paper

---------08:03----------
towel not even a good look down a paper

---------08:05----------
towel one of those cheap-ass Sparkle

---------08:07----------
paper towels that you get off of off of

---------08:09----------
Amazon I can't believe I keep leaving

---------08:15----------
the brush in the front

---------08:28----------
rub around that esd-safe towel clean

---------08:48----------
the eye

---------09:07----------
throat lining this push down and make

---------09:09----------
sure it's actually stuck wherever you

---------09:10----------
put it

---------09:16----------
it's hard to do that because when you

---------09:18----------
push down when you push back up it's a

---------09:20----------
it's gonna move around that's a pain in

---------09:21----------
the ass like that okay the other day I

---------09:24----------
got that nasty flux there let's put the

---------09:26----------
fume extractor right up close and time

---------09:30----------
for heating

---------10:28----------
you

---------10:59----------
so I'm currently a victim of my hot air

---------11:02----------
station not getting hot in that didn't

---------11:05----------
melt the way it should

---------11:14----------
for the sudden the last few videos idea

---------11:16----------
this thing has just not been heating

---------11:19----------
lately the way it's supposed to so once

---------11:26----------
you heat it you can see it move back and

---------11:27----------
forth like I just did like you see how I

---------11:29----------
poke did it move but then the air itself

---------11:31----------
is actually moving it back and forth so

---------11:32----------
you can see the chip was swaying like

---------11:34----------
that that that that depth that's how you

---------11:35----------
know that it's actually been sorted

---------11:36----------
properly but if it's not moving back and

---------11:39----------
forth and doing that motion you probably

---------11:41----------
didn't solder it properly you should be

---------11:43----------
able to get that cuz then you know that

---------11:44----------
all the balls are fluid all the walls

---------11:47----------
are liquidus and yet you've melted

---------11:49----------
everything so yeah I'm at 8 right now

---------11:53----------
which should be actually burning the

---------11:54----------
chips so as soon as I touch the chip it

---------11:56----------
should be burning because I'm at a too

---------11:57----------
high temperature and it was still and it

---------12:00----------
wasn't even melting it so I need to

---------12:01----------
replace the heating element in my affari

---------12:03----------
I don't want that's something that I I

---------12:05----------
keep saying I'm gonna do and the real

---------12:08----------
world keeps getting in the way of me

---------12:09----------
having the time one of the I mean I know

---------12:13----------
I'm gonna have the time once that thing

---------12:15----------
doesn't eat at all I'm gonna have a lot

---------12:16----------
of a lot of spare time left so it really

---------12:19----------
is something I should do immediately and

---------12:24----------
what do you know the screen that Apple

---------12:27----------
wanted to replace is [ __ ] fine and

---------12:30----------
responsible for another customer coming

---------12:32----------
in and screaming and thinking of mine

---------12:34----------
trying to rip them off I'm wondering why

---------12:37----------
it's gonna take longer and blah blah

---------12:38----------
blah is what it is so um lesson of the

---------12:44----------
day

---------12:44----------
never trust the Genius Bar because

---------12:46----------
they're not geniuses a lot of the time

---------12:50----------
they're pretty [ __ ] dumb alright so

---------12:51----------
here's another thing that bothers me

---------12:53----------
about this so right we got the machine

---------12:54----------
working now this person came in and said

---------12:57----------
that we had told him it's possible to

---------12:59----------
fix and one hour this was because he had

---------13:02----------
told us he guaranteed it was the screen

---------13:04----------
you knew was the screen you know ba ba

---------13:06----------
ba now it comes in and it's a

---------13:08----------
motherboard issue and since the weekend

---------13:10----------
is coming up and there's nobody really

---------13:12----------
here to do that on the weekend or do

---------13:13----------
this type of troubleshooting we say

---------13:15----------
three to five days we always tell people

---------13:16----------
you know it's 2:00 to 4:00 3:00 to 5:00

---------13:18----------
when it comes to board repairs because

---------13:19----------
let's face it you really never know

---------13:21----------
what's gonna go wrong you never know

---------13:22----------
again it's a hoarder stuff and you never

---------13:24----------
know when it's gonna be a rabbit hole to

---------13:25----------
hell and he goes on

---------13:27----------
and on and on about how I who would

---------13:30----------
God's name could be three to five days

---------13:32----------
without their computer that's ridiculous

---------13:34----------
why would just take so long you needless

---------13:36----------
to say like this yeah how many places in

---------13:38----------
the u.s. actually do these board level

---------13:39----------
repairs where they can do them on camera

---------13:41----------
and explain everything inside of 13

---------13:43----------
minutes like yep but beside that's

---------13:45----------
beside the point

---------13:46----------
so I did something that I usually tell

---------13:47----------
you not to do so once somebody starts

---------13:49----------
acting like that

---------13:50----------
I will simply not take their money I'll

---------13:51----------
give it back to them because if you've

---------13:52----------
done as you've shown me that you are

---------13:53----------
gonna become a problem you show me

---------13:55----------
you're gonna be a problem and you really

---------13:57----------
just show me that you'd have no general

---------13:58----------
respect for us or well anything that

---------14:00----------
we're doing by acting in that manner we

---------14:02----------
take it in anyway and just because he

---------14:05----------
reads it I just want just one one time I

---------14:08----------
broke my rule I always do things in the

---------14:09----------
order that I get them I look at

---------14:11----------
everything in the order that I get them

---------14:12----------
I may decide that because this is

---------14:14----------
miserable you're going to the bottom of

---------14:16----------
the pile but I always look at the jobs

---------14:17----------
in the order that they actually come in

---------14:18----------
it's just basic human fairness he tells

---------14:21----------
me how he needs it for work I we just

---------14:22----------
flew in how everything stopped working

---------14:23----------
right I have to reflow you know flew

---------14:25----------
here from internationally and now this

---------14:27----------
is just a nightmare

---------14:27----------
and I feel just a little little a little

---------14:29----------
bit bad and this is the problem yeah

---------14:31----------
after you start feeling bad for people

---------14:32----------
this is why in these videos and also in

---------14:35----------
with people that I know I encourage you

---------14:36----------
to look at this board as money look at

---------14:38----------
it as a piece of silicon don't look at

---------14:40----------
it like the you the people using it

---------14:42----------
don't look at it like this person as

---------14:44----------
their what the work on it this person is

---------14:45----------
their life on it this person is their

---------14:46----------
baby pictures on it you look at it like

---------14:48----------
it's just another job it's just another

---------14:50----------
board in the pile because if you start

---------14:52----------
looking at it like that then you become

---------14:53----------
emotionally invested in the jobs you

---------14:55----------
become emotionally invested and trying

---------14:56----------
to figure it out

---------14:57----------
but more importantly you also won't

---------15:00----------
start to care when they start to do

---------15:01----------
things like what I'm gonna say next so I

---------15:03----------
call him the town listen I understand

---------15:04----------
that this was a priority for you

---------15:06----------
so I actually pushed you you know we

---------15:07----------
were able to get it done today it was

---------15:09----------
what do you mean you said it would be

---------15:10----------
three to five days and I go with board

---------15:11----------
issues it can take through up to three

---------15:13----------
to five days but we can figure it out

---------15:15----------
sooner I actually decided to be honest

---------15:17----------
do you know again like most people when

---------15:18----------
dealing with the douche they're gonna

---------15:19----------
pay they were gonna purposely call you

---------15:21----------
in a few days to make it look like it

---------15:23----------
was harder than it actually was and

---------15:25----------
that's one of the things that we try not

---------15:26----------
to do here so one of the differences

---------15:27----------
between us and other places are very

---------15:29----------
often is instead of lying to people to

---------15:31----------
get the point across we simply make them

---------15:33----------
humble so you know we make them instead

---------15:35----------
of instead of having a lie and cheat to

---------15:38----------
get them to feel a certain way we will

---------15:40----------
we explain everything the way it is and

---------15:42----------
if you decide to be a douchebag we will

---------15:45----------
make you feel bad for it she's like come

---------15:46----------
on man that was easy you figured it out

---------15:49----------
like nothing you're still gonna charge

---------15:50----------
me that for it and as you know I said

---------15:52----------
sir you're welcome I'm gonna take this

---------15:54----------
off and you're welcome to figure it out

---------15:55----------
and if you can figure it out in under

---------15:57----------
three to five days I'll give it to you

---------15:58----------
for free you know I even said most

---------16:00----------
people are when they deal with somebody

---------16:02----------
like you and he was what do you mean

---------16:03----------
like me as an impatient and

---------16:05----------
disrespectful what they're going to do

---------16:06----------
is they're gonna purposely call you in a

---------16:08----------
few days just to make it seem harder but

---------16:09----------
we don't lie to you usually people are

---------16:11----------
actually happier when they're pushed to

---------16:13----------
the front of the line and have that

---------16:14----------
courtesy that they were done faster than

---------16:16----------
somebody else usually if somebody comes

---------16:18----------
in and their board is fixed within 30

---------16:20----------
minutes of arriving here that is

---------16:21----------
something that that they would enjoy but

---------16:23----------
I can see that you're not one of those

---------16:24----------
people so what I can do is I can remove

---------16:26----------
this chip and I will put it back on on

---------16:28----------
Wednesday since that's what we agreed so

---------16:30----------
you are correct and he goes oh no no no

---------16:32----------
no I'm sorry I'll be right then like ya

---------16:33----------
[ __ ] you aren't sorry and and it

---------16:35----------
is it's one of those things you know

---------16:37----------
again I'm not gonna start lying to

---------16:38----------
people so that they they that I I don't

---------16:40----------
I don't want to start lying to people

---------16:42----------
and making it seem like it's that much

---------16:43----------
harder than it actually is

---------16:44----------
just because they're gonna be a douche

---------16:46----------
bag like if I had taken five days he

---------16:48----------
would have said what I mean I'm five

---------16:50----------
days without a computer that's [ __ ]

---------16:51----------
I do it fast it's like what you mean you

---------16:53----------
did it that fast it's bullish it's like

---------16:54----------
either way you don't win so one of the

---------16:56----------
points I want to get across with this

---------16:57----------
video lying is not it's not not always

---------17:00----------
the property thing to do again I've

---------17:01----------
talked in other videos about why

---------17:02----------
technicians lie to customers I

---------17:04----------
understand it but really honestly

---------17:06----------
speaking it is not the thing to do the

---------17:08----------
thing that you should be aiming to do is

---------17:09----------
keep your customers humble and again you

---------17:12----------
have to you can't explain it like

---------17:13----------
passive-aggressively like a wiseass

---------17:14----------
because again when I'm doing these

---------17:16----------
videos I'm usually doing them with the

---------17:18----------
I'm trying to get a point across so I'm

---------17:19----------
a little bit more animated than I am in

---------17:21----------
the real world I'm a little bit more

---------17:22----------
exaggerated you know one example of this

---------17:25----------
is cursing you know believe it or not in

---------17:26----------
the real world I actually don't curse

---------17:28----------
that much not at all but my point here

---------17:30----------
is the whole idea is to keep them humble

---------17:33----------
it's not to lie to them it's not to make

---------17:35----------
things seem harder than they are it's

---------17:36----------
not to lie and say that you did

---------17:37----------
something different I know if you're

---------17:39----------
charging if you're charging somebody you

---------17:41----------
know $1,000 to replace a single zero

---------17:44----------
4:02 capacitor on a board for a crane

---------17:46----------
that operates a crane or something like

---------17:48----------
that you need to be honest and happy

---------17:50----------
about what it is you're doing and what

---------17:51----------
you're charging

---------17:52----------
and that's it like whatever business

---------17:55----------
model you have you need to be proud of

---------17:57----------
it and you can't be like you can't be

---------17:59----------
lying and cheating in the scheming just

---------18:01----------
because people are trying to beat you

---------18:02----------
down on price or make it seem like

---------18:03----------
you're ripping them off and blah blah

---------18:04----------
blah

---------18:05----------
you really do have to make them humble

---------18:07----------
so in this case somebody comes in they

---------18:09----------
complain I did the wrong thing I push

---------18:11----------
you to the front of the line I get your

---------18:13----------
border pair done on camera in 13 minutes

---------18:15----------
I call you within 20 to 30 minutes to

---------18:17----------
tell you it's completed and you're

---------18:19----------
actually mad again this is one of those

---------18:21----------
things like I finish it in three days

---------18:22----------
you're mad it took three days I'm mad

---------18:24----------
that my machine

---------18:25----------
you take one day you're mad you without

---------18:26----------
your shame for one day I do it in an

---------18:28----------
hour you're mad that I'm charging here

---------18:30----------
it's like you know what the you have to

---------18:31----------
realize that with some people you're

---------18:32----------
never going to win and it's not worth

---------18:34----------
lowering yourself to their level it's

---------18:36----------
not worth lying it's not worth becoming

---------18:38----------
the same very piece of [ __ ] that they

---------18:39----------
are just to deal with them it's it's not

---------18:42----------
worth lowering yourself to that level it

---------18:44----------
really is you know you should begin

---------18:46----------
simply make people humble and in when

---------18:50----------
you're dealing with them it's not about

---------18:52----------
you know it's not about lying to them

---------18:54----------
it's not about making [ __ ] up and again

---------18:56----------
you know I I didn't even bother going

---------18:57----------
through the whole idea of you know yes

---------19:00----------
it is simple enough to do in 13 minutes

---------19:02----------
after like 17 years of electronics you

---------19:04----------
just lay it on the table and that's it

---------19:07----------
I'll take it off and if you can reattach

---------19:10----------
it if you can do if you can do any

---------19:12----------
estimate with any of the equipment that

---------19:13----------
I have here by all means you can have it

---------19:17----------
free
