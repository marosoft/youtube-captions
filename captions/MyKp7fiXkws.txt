---------00:00----------
hi Lois I was told by Holger who

---------00:02----------
referenced you to me to send you a

---------00:03----------
message telling you the whole ordeal of

---------00:05----------
how he ended up sending my laptop to you

---------00:07----------
basically I was just using it one day it

---------00:10----------
turned off and wouldn't turn back on I

---------00:11----------
went to the Apple store by Michigan

---------00:13----------
State University because that's what

---------00:15----------
distressed college students first

---------00:16----------
instinct is they then told me my smc was

---------00:19----------
broken it would cost $100 for the part

---------00:22----------
and 400 for labor and if they did that

---------00:24----------
it would wipe the memory off of my

---------00:25----------
laptop even though my laptop was

---------00:27----------
purchased in January 2017 so after that

---------00:30----------
I went to the Best Buy out here and was

---------00:32----------
told that there was nothing they can do

---------00:34----------
because my insurance in the laptop

---------00:35----------
expired on January 23rd 2017 when I

---------00:39----------
actually purchased it On January 28th

---------00:41----------
2017 I they've called my mom since she

---------00:45----------
was still in our hometown where we

---------00:46----------
purchased the laptop she went to the

---------00:48----------
Best Buy out here and was told there was

---------00:50----------
nothing they can do about it so she went

---------00:52----------
into the Apple store in our hometown as

---------00:54----------
well gave them the diagnostic from the

---------00:55----------
MSU Apple store and the genius went back

---------00:58----------
into the back to call the other Apple

---------01:00----------
store and wouldn't tell her what they

---------01:02----------
talked about on the phone he then came

---------01:04----------
back out told to the only option was the

---------01:06----------
$500 fix but his words were we don't

---------01:09----------
actually know what's wrong with it but

---------01:11----------
we can guarantee we will fix it upon

---------01:14----------
asking him what they were doing that

---------01:15----------
will guarantee the fix they refused to

---------01:17----------
tell us and then just said the exact

---------01:18----------
same thing over and over again so after

---------01:20----------
that we went to the Best Buy once again

---------01:22----------
and we were told by Best Buy to buy a

---------01:24----------
battery from Batteries Plus come back

---------01:26----------
buy a $200 geek squad plan and we'll

---------01:28----------
cover the cost of backing up my laptop

---------01:30----------
and installing the battery it took about

---------01:32----------
a week to get the battery in and when it

---------01:34----------
was finally in we went to the store to

---------01:35----------
pick it up and it wasn't there so after

---------01:37----------
going back and forth with batteries plus

---------01:39----------
they finally figured out what was wrong

---------01:41----------
and got the battery we then took it to

---------01:42----------
Best Buy in a Friday night we're told to

---------01:44----------
make an appointment on Saturday to get

---------01:46----------
the battery put him between noon and 7

---------01:47----------
p.m. so he decided on 2 p.m. we went

---------01:50----------
back the next day granted I drove 80

---------01:52----------
miles from Lansing to Grand Rapids to

---------01:54----------
deal with the issue at the Best Buy we

---------01:55----------
bought the computer from and the

---------01:57----------
associates at Best Buy had no idea who

---------01:58----------
we were and what we're talking about

---------02:00----------
after a long heated conversation with

---------02:02----------
the general manager of the Geek Squad we

---------02:03----------
were told that Best Buy doesn't actually

---------02:05----------
fix MacBooks whoever told us that

---------02:07----------
information was straight-up lying to our

---------02:08----------
faces and then we had to return the

---------02:10----------
battery which we apparently over way

---------02:11----------
overpaid for as well after

---------02:13----------
that we had no idea who to go to to get

---------02:15----------
this fixed and as we have no idea what

---------02:17----------
the actual issue of my laptop is finally

---------02:19----------
we contacted Holger drove over to his

---------02:21----------
house and he opened up the computer

---------02:22----------
which Best Buy said they could not do

---------02:24----------
because it was too dangerous and my

---------02:25----------
lithium batteries would explode upon

---------02:28----------
Holger opening up the computer in a

---------02:29----------
matter of seconds and explaining to us

---------02:31----------
why Apple and Best bias so corrupt in

---------02:32----------
their processes of fixing their products

---------02:34----------
he gave us your name and website we

---------02:36----------
watched a couple of your videos and sent

---------02:37----------
a laptop out immediately so let's go

---------02:39----------
over a few things that are troublesome

---------02:40----------
with this story first of all that

---------02:41----------
opening the laptop is dangerous because

---------02:43----------
the lithium-ion battery you can't open

---------02:45----------
it cuz can we second thing second thing

---------02:59----------
is that the SMC is bad and that because

---------03:03----------
the SMC chip over here is bad that must

---------03:05----------
mean that you're gonna lose your data

---------03:06----------
right you're gonna lose all the data

---------03:07----------
even though on this machine if you wish

---------03:11----------
to remove the SSD you can do so

---------03:15----------
just like this so watch this if you want

---------03:18----------
to preserve the data in this computer

---------03:19----------
because you want to swap the board you

---------03:21----------
remove one screw you slide out the SSD

---------03:24----------
you replace the board and then once you

---------03:26----------
have replaced the defective motherboard

---------03:28----------
even if you have no idea to fix this

---------03:30----------
thing at all once you've replaced a

---------03:32----------
defective motherboard you take that SSD

---------03:34----------
you slide it into the new motherboard

---------03:36----------
you put the screw in and the customer

---------03:39----------
retains their data this is not that hard

---------03:43----------
and there is no excuse for any Apple

---------03:46----------
store to say that they cannot preserve

---------03:47----------
customer data when it is there a paring

---------03:49----------
a machine you don't have to copy the

---------03:51----------
data you don't have to deal with a

---------03:53----------
program that images the drive or

---------03:55----------
anything like that you do this do this

---------04:01----------
you take the drive out you put the new

---------04:05----------
board in you plug the solid-state drive

---------04:07----------
into the new board and then you screw it

---------04:12----------
in this is one screw it's not that hard

---------04:16----------
anyway I just turned this into a PC so

---------04:22----------
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

---------04:24----------
see if we can fix this MacBook Board and

---------04:25----------
see what's wrong with it

---------04:27----------
is it the SMC does it need a new battery

---------04:29----------
did any of these people get it right or

---------04:32----------
not one way to find out let's dig into

---------04:34----------
this machine and see what's going on all

---------04:37----------
right so you've got a MacBook Air in

---------04:38----------
this MacBook Air claims to be dead we're

---------04:42----------
gonna plug it in turn on my power supply

---------04:44----------
here we're gonna see how many amps it

---------04:45----------
grabs and its peers to grab 0.009 which

---------04:49----------
is pretty dead so let's open it up and

---------04:50----------
see why this MacBook happens to be dead

---------04:52----------
according to the ticket

---------04:53----------
it says won't power on no liquid which

---------04:56----------
of course is probably a lie but there's

---------04:58----------
only one way to find out if that's the

---------05:01----------
case all right let's get a good look at

---------05:03----------
this MacBook so we're gonna zoom in and

---------05:06----------
it's a pretty clean looking MacBook all

---------05:08----------
right so we're gonna unplug the flex

---------05:11----------
cable for the keyboard and all this

---------05:13----------
stuff and see if we get any different

---------05:15----------
results maybe we do maybe we don't

---------05:18----------
wouldn't it be great if this MacBook was

---------05:20----------
just a bad trackpad but alas no we still

---------05:23----------
don't get fan spin and we're still only

---------05:25----------
drawing 0.01

---------05:28----------
let's take a look at this under the

---------05:30----------
microscope and see if could be an idea

---------05:32----------
of why MacBook is dead

---------05:51----------
under the microscope there's no

---------05:53----------
clear-cut obvious reason for why MacBook

---------05:55----------
is dead

---------05:55----------
oh well imagine that I think I can see

---------06:02----------
why MacBook is dead now let's take a

---------06:04----------
look and see what that's for this looks

---------06:07----------
similar to the board that didn't work

---------06:09----------
earlier so I'm going to open up a

---------06:10----------
schematic for an 8 - 0 0 0 165 board and

---------06:12----------
get that on the screen and let's see if

---------06:14----------
Paul Daniels is new software that I

---------06:16----------
update it will work or come you 7501 is

---------06:20----------
going to be used for creating three

---------06:22----------
different power rails it's gonna be used

---------06:24----------
to create PP 5 vs 4 RS 3 what is this AR

---------06:28----------
in the middle of the screen here Paul

---------06:29----------
Daniels what does that say I updated

---------06:33----------
your software I trusted you

---------06:35----------
never updating software again click over

---------06:39----------
to my microscope camera and remove this

---------06:44----------
chip because it seems to be corroded

---------06:45----------
almost as corroded as Paul Daniels's

---------06:48----------
code and his heart Paul Daniels knew

---------06:51----------
that I had working software and he

---------06:52----------
decided to update it to avert to change

---------06:56----------
it so that I wouldn't be able to fix

---------06:57----------
boards anymore so that he would be able

---------06:58----------
to monopolize once he moves to the

---------07:00----------
United States I'm kidding I like Paul

---------07:02----------
Daniels but he always tells me to update

---------07:04----------
software and every time I update

---------07:06----------
software it doesn't work it's it's not

---------07:09----------
just the Paul Daniels thing it's a

---------07:10----------
general thing in life if I have a

---------07:13----------
working version of software I stick with

---------07:15----------
that working version the software

---------07:27----------
all right I can see that most solder

---------07:29----------
joints are melted which means I should

---------07:31----------
be able to do this

---------07:39----------
there's a pad there that's rusted

---------07:47----------
why is that pad rusted

---------07:52----------
and what is that pad for well there's

---------07:55----------
one way to find out by using Paul

---------07:56----------
Daniels this amazing board review

---------07:57----------
software here you can just click and we

---------08:00----------
can see but that pad is for P P 5 V s 5

---------08:03----------
PP 5 es 5 is totally corroded as a

---------08:07----------
result we're likely not getting PP 5 es

---------08:09----------
5 and if we're not getting PP 5 es 5 the

---------08:12----------
board's not gonna work and turn on so

---------08:14----------
let's try and fix up that pad and make

---------08:16----------
this a happy little board yeah I'm gonna

---------08:19----------
use my micro pencil my t 30 - KN we're

---------08:24----------
gonna go over all these pads and make

---------08:27----------
them nice again this board's gonna turn

---------08:33----------
on and it's going to be happy fitter

---------08:37----------
more productive

---------08:46----------
all right now let's really zoom in and

---------08:50----------
work on that pad that seems to be

---------08:51----------
corroded

---------08:58----------
updates are usually for a good reason no

---------09:00----------
they're not

---------09:01----------
updates are to break the software so

---------09:03----------
that you have to purchase a support

---------09:04----------
package or a new version updates are a

---------09:08----------
conspiracy never update software all

---------09:13----------
right so we're just gonna scrape until

---------09:15----------
we get a pad because I believe that

---------09:17----------
there's actually a pad under there and

---------09:19----------
I'm gonna prove it to you we're gonna

---------09:24----------
scrape in line with the pad and this is

---------09:29----------
why my T 30 - KN tips typically last a

---------09:31----------
few weeks even though they cost almost

---------09:35----------
$50

---------09:44----------
here we go we're revealing pad keep

---------09:47----------
scraping we don't want to scrape too

---------09:51----------
hard we just want to scrape hard enough

---------09:53----------
to get rid of all the junk on there and

---------09:55----------
the is gonna help us and the fact

---------09:57----------
that the iron is a little bit of solder

---------09:59----------
on it's gonna help us and at the fact

---------10:03----------
that the iron is boiling hot SCANA help

---------10:05----------
us

---------10:14----------
and you want to make sure we didn't just

---------10:15----------
put solder on top of corrosion so I'm

---------10:18----------
gonna take a little bit of wick and I'm

---------10:20----------
gonna remove the solder just in case

---------10:22----------
just in case we'd pull the nono and put

---------10:25----------
solder on top of corrosion I want to see

---------10:27----------
what it looks like under all that stuff

---------10:31----------
granted you're not supposed to be

---------10:33----------
wicking with a micro pencil which is

---------10:35----------
another reason that these tips usually

---------10:37----------
last me like a week

---------10:46----------
so I'm gonna I'm gonna put on a proper

---------10:47----------
iron for this for wicking time for some

---------10:51----------
pads to get wikked

---------11:00----------
they're gonna remove all the solder that

---------11:02----------
we put on these paths so we put leaded

---------11:04----------
solder over the lead-free solder we went

---------11:07----------
over it enough times that most of the

---------11:08----------
lead-free is probably gone

---------11:10----------
now I'm gonna wick it all away and the

---------11:13----------
reason I'm doing that is because I want

---------11:14----------
to make sure that I didn't just put

---------11:15----------
solder on top of corrosion up there I

---------11:17----------
want to make sure that I actually

---------11:20----------
removed all of the corrosion in the junk

---------11:22----------
that was located near that pad so I do a

---------11:27----------
good amount of scraping much scraping

---------11:30----------
right by that area but gently it's much

---------11:33----------
gentle scraping and I'm satisfied at

---------11:36----------
this point that I've removed all the

---------11:38----------
corrosion from that pad now that pad is

---------11:40----------
fitter happier and more productive

---------11:52----------
not thinking too much regular exercise

---------11:55----------
at the gym fitter happier hitter

---------12:08----------
happier

---------12:10----------
more duck fitter happier

---------12:18----------
more food

---------12:25----------
regular exercise at the gym not thinking

---------12:30----------
too much

---------13:01----------
my bridge and the bottom left will clean

---------13:03----------
itself up in a jiffy

---------13:18----------
oK we've got it centered now we got to

---------13:22----------
push it down so it's in place

---------13:35----------
but a little bit of just a small

---------13:39----------
amount enough to get everything working

---------14:09----------
now I'm gonna start at a left-handed

---------14:18----------
we don't wish that pain on anybody

---------14:39----------
begone ship

---------15:11----------
can Macbook work again Macbook can work

---------15:16----------
again MacBook is fixed so it appears

---------15:21----------
there was corrosion around my 5 and 3

---------15:24----------
volt regulator IC and we had a corroded

---------15:26----------
pad can were able to fix that corroded

---------15:28----------
pad with a three-step process first we

---------15:31----------
add solder around all the pads in that

---------15:34----------
area then we scrape and then after we're

---------15:38----------
done scraping we use wick to make sure

---------15:41----------
that any solder that we added did not

---------15:44----------
just go on top of dirt once we have a

---------15:46----------
perfectly flat pad surface with no any

---------15:49----------
contaminant crap on it then we can add

---------15:52----------
flux and add new solder to the pads and

---------15:55----------
put a new chip but it's important to not

---------15:57----------
solder a chip on top of corrosion if you

---------15:59----------
solder a chip on top of corrosion and

---------16:01----------
won't work and often if you just add

---------16:03----------
solder on top of corrosion you could be

---------16:04----------
fooling yourself into believing that

---------16:06----------
you've created a contact when in reality

---------16:08----------
there is no good contact if there is

---------16:11----------
resistance at that point the machine

---------16:12----------
will use too much power and you may have

---------16:14----------
random shutdowns or it may not work at

---------16:16----------
all a little trip a current sensing

---------16:17----------
circuit or it'll only work on a non

---------16:19----------
original charger and all sorts of nasty

---------16:21----------
stuff so just make sure you do it right

---------16:22----------
the first time that's it for today and

---------16:24----------
as always I hope you learned something

---------16:34----------
you
