---------00:00----------
all right so today we're going over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero 34:37 air board this has

---------00:03----------
already been ultrasonic but the stated

---------00:05----------
problem is that it is dead so you get no

---------00:07----------
light in the charger no light in the

---------00:10----------
charger now the reason for no light in

---------00:12----------
the charger is usually the PP 3v for 2

---------00:14----------
circuits so to give you an idea on a

---------00:16----------
motherboard we can actually see it on

---------00:17----------
the schematic what that circuit is and

---------00:18----------
what it does the last time I'm probably

---------00:20----------
going to explain this since I've

---------00:21----------
explained it in 60 other videos the one

---------00:23----------
wire circuit is used oh no one here we

---------00:26----------
go alright so this over here is the

---------00:31----------
adapter this is where the adapter comes

---------00:32----------
into the machine this is on an older

---------00:34----------
motherboard so this is 18 volts going

---------00:36----------
through to the Machine and this over

---------00:37----------
here is the line called adapter sense

---------00:39----------
adapter sense attaches to this chip this

---------00:42----------
chip and the adapter sense line from the

---------00:44----------
charger the adapter sense attaches to X

---------00:47----------
for external then there's internal where

---------00:50----------
that chip is going to take that same

---------00:51----------
signal and send it out sis one wire on a

---------00:53----------
bi-directional data line to the SMC

---------00:55----------
right over here see where it says by

---------00:57----------
that it means bi-directional data line

---------01:00----------
now the SMC needs to talk to the charger

---------01:02----------
for it to turn on so let's go back to

---------01:05----------
where that was this is one wire line now

---------01:07----------
what turns this chip on every time you

---------01:09----------
see VCC VDD or anything like that you're

---------01:11----------
going to see you know that that is what

---------01:13----------
this chip needs in order to actually

---------01:14----------
powered or turned on so the VCC pin for

---------01:16----------
this and also the pull-up resistor for

---------01:18----------
the data line for this one wire if you

---------01:20----------
don't know what a pull-up resistor is of

---------01:21----------
either what is a pull-up resistor and

---------01:23----------
how does it create a data line video

---------01:24----------
that is created from this chip this is a

---------01:27----------
logic aid the way this works is when it

---------01:29----------
sees SMC bc AC okay come in when that

---------01:31----------
comes in then PP 3 V 4 to underscore G 3

---------01:35----------
out which is a three-point 42 volt power

---------01:37----------
line will be let through to this chip

---------01:38----------
and it will turn on without PP 3 V 4 to

---------01:41----------
you will get nothing else now the air

---------01:43----------
board is a little bit different because

---------01:44----------
the one wire circuit on the Dare board

---------01:46----------
is on the DCN board and we don't get a

---------01:48----------
schematic for the DC n board because

---------01:49----------
Apple sucks so we just have to assume

---------01:51----------
based on the older circuit idea that we

---------01:54----------
still have to deal with one wire circuit

---------01:56----------
and that that's the you know still

---------01:58----------
Nia requires pp3 before - so when I go

---------02:01----------
to search for assists underscore one

---------02:03----------
wire on this board here we go so since

---------02:07----------
one wire is on this J 9500 J 9500 which

---------02:11----------
you can't see because I'm on the wrong

---------02:12----------
cat

---------02:13----------
since one wire goes to the DCN board so

---------02:16----------
J 9500 when you go to the board view

---------02:19----------
software J 9500

---------02:22----------
yeah that's C that's that that's the

---------02:24----------
connector for the DCN board and there's

---------02:25----------
also PP 3 V 4 to sum we're going to the

---------02:28----------
DC and boards let's just look for that

---------02:32----------
yeah if sm c bc AC ok going there so you

---------02:35----------
know that the one wiring circuit has to

---------02:37----------
be on that side you need sm c bc AC ok

---------02:39----------
to be present in order for the one wire

---------02:41----------
circuit to turn on and allow the charger

---------02:43----------
to talk to the SMC and you have PP 3 V 4

---------02:45----------
to underscore G 3 hot going there so

---------02:51----------
let's see if P P 3 V 4 to underscore G 3

---------02:53----------
hot is present on my board so since

---------02:59----------
that's needed for the one wire circuit

---------03:00----------
to work and to get a charge alight so

---------03:02----------
that's supposed to be coming out right

---------03:03----------
over here so when I check that on the

---------03:08----------
board that's gonna be over there

---------03:12----------
I'm gonna take my multimeter and diode

---------03:14----------
mode put the red probe on ground but the

---------03:16----------
black probe where pp 3 V 4 2 is supposed

---------03:19----------
to be and I have a 0 ohms short to

---------03:22----------
ground which means that it is shorted to

---------03:24----------
ground by something so we have to figure

---------03:25----------
out what that is because PP 3 V 4 -

---------03:27----------
won't be present if it's being sent to

---------03:28----------
ground and also if you look in this area

---------03:32----------
doesn't really look the nicest it looks

---------03:34----------
like there is corrosion there even

---------03:36----------
though it has been through an ultrasonic

---------03:37----------
cleaner already so let's just zoom in on

---------03:39----------
microscope turn the light up a little

---------03:41----------
bit so you can see not the nicest thing

---------03:45----------
in the world now the funny thing here is

---------03:47----------
even though this area is covered under

---------03:48----------
this under finished looking nonsense

---------03:50----------
used they were still it was still able

---------03:52----------
to get damaged by liquid so this didn't

---------03:54----------
do anything

---------03:55----------
nice try and pretending to be lenovo

---------03:58----------
your stuff was not waterproof and it

---------04:00----------
never will be so let's remove that just

---------04:03----------
have to heat it up a little bit and then

---------04:11----------
I'm going to attach a wire there and

---------04:12----------
we're gonna see what gets hot since the

---------04:14----------
short to ground is so immediate I'm

---------04:16----------
pretty sure it's gonna be something

---------04:17----------
obvious and something that's gonna get

---------04:19----------
hot really quickly

---------04:25----------
well I almost burned my microscope okay

---------04:39----------
I hate this junk this doesn't actually

---------04:44----------
do just annoy that is just annoying

---------04:47----------
alright so let's see where the short is

---------04:51----------
so we have to inject three volts there

---------04:52----------
to see where the short is let's take my

---------04:55----------
power supply wire and blow up the board

---------05:06----------
so I'm going to put solder on a screw

---------05:09----------
hole I know I'm sure there are more

---------05:13----------
professional ways to do this and I'm

---------05:15----------
sure that a lot of people will say that

---------05:16----------
this is not professional and I'm also

---------05:18----------
certain that I won't care so I'm going

---------05:24----------
to take the ground

---------05:32----------
and shove it in there I don't care about

---------05:34----------
the quality of the soldering there

---------05:35----------
because it's not like that's gonna stay

---------05:37----------
there anyway I'm gonna take this area

---------05:39----------
over here where three volts is supposed

---------05:41----------
to be and 3.42 volts isn't again not

---------05:44----------
giving a crap about the quality of the

---------05:45----------
soldering this is the purpose of this EF

---------05:48----------
that realizes to blow something up it's

---------05:49----------
not a permanent repair so I I'm not

---------05:52----------
gonna waste time on those things now I

---------05:54----------
set my power supply over here to 3.42

---------05:56----------
volts voltage 3.42 currents a lot of

---------06:03----------
people ask why I don't limit current and

---------06:05----------
makes it harder to find things alright

---------06:08----------
so let's see what's let's see if it's

---------06:11----------
obvious so what gets hot what gets hot

---------06:17----------
what gets hot

---------06:46----------
now a little guide here what's gonna get

---------06:50----------
hot has to be something that is pp3

---------06:51----------
before - so these are the potential

---------06:56----------
things that could be getting hot

---------06:58----------
I should rotate this so it's the same

---------07:00----------
way as the board is in the desk

---------07:10----------
hmm you guys see anything that looks

---------07:12----------
suspicious hmm hmm all right

---------07:22----------
this is gonna be even after that

---------07:24----------
I can just tell from what it looks like

---------07:26----------
the SMC will likely need replacing well

---------07:35----------
okay and the short is gone all righty

---------07:42----------
now keep in mind that the short will on

---------07:45----------
three caps that go directly to the SMC

---------07:47----------
so what do you think is gonna be screwed

---------07:49----------
next oh yeah this will be no fun okay so

---------07:53----------
we're gonna take those three caps off of

---------07:55----------
a donor board and pray that the SMC is

---------07:57----------
good which it probably isn't are you

---------08:07----------
still recording I can't read that Ernest

---------08:11----------
I really can't read that

---------08:24----------
common sense prevails

---------08:48----------
Rahn tip

---------09:12----------
now the pads are kind of messed up so

---------09:14----------
it's gonna require some scraping let's

---------09:16----------
make them work again worst case scenario

---------09:25----------
we can just break that trace run a wire

---------09:28----------
to the capacitor and just do that

---------09:54----------
you'll feel it in your in your hand when

---------09:56----------
you're scraping it versus when you're

---------09:58----------
not so in the beginning there I wasn't

---------09:59----------
scraping a damn thing and I couldn't

---------10:04----------
feel it and I also noticed that you

---------10:05----------
couldn't really see any solder getting

---------10:07----------
on the pad but now it's scraped and it's

---------10:09----------
good you're also gonna see that there

---------10:11----------
are some burned resistors to the side

---------10:12----------
those at this time I don't care about

---------10:14----------
because I know that those are actually

---------10:16----------
for those are for you know that's for

---------10:19----------
Apple that's for programming the SMC

---------10:20----------
using that little connector on the other

---------10:22----------
side of the board that will never ever

---------10:23----------
get to use over the course of our

---------10:24----------
lifetime I don't give a about

---------10:26----------
programming the SMC because I don't get

---------10:28----------
to do that if I want to fix the SMC I

---------10:31----------
have to take it off with another board

---------10:32----------
and attach ninety six point two five

---------10:35----------
millimeter balls to it oh yeah so I

---------10:38----------
don't give a about those resistors

---------10:40----------
they're for something I don't get to

---------10:41----------
have or play with I just flew something

---------10:50----------
right off of the board

---------10:53----------
I'll have to put that back on unless

---------10:56----------
it's for programming the SMC that is in

---------11:00----------
which case I won't

---------12:09----------
the cool thing about the flux and the

---------12:10----------
hot air is that it's gonna remote

---------12:11----------
everything in a place so it doesn't look

---------12:13----------
like I screwed with it and everything is

---------12:14----------
gonna be aligned perfectly even if I did

---------12:16----------
aligned it really badly so let's see

---------12:18----------
what that little this thing is over here

---------12:20----------
is this important you 37:10

---------12:33----------
that's for the SSD yeah we're gonna

---------12:36----------
assume I got to put that back on all

---------12:38----------
right

---------12:41----------
there are certain things I don't care

---------12:43----------
about like programming they're that

---------12:45----------
thing to program the SMC while the SMC

---------12:47----------
is on the board that's not something I'm

---------12:49----------
ever gonna put back on a fight or waste

---------12:52----------
timeline ready

---------13:07----------
if I were smart I would be seeing if the

---------13:09----------
board actually works at this point and

---------13:10----------
care about the SSD thing later but I

---------13:13----------
know that I'm gonna forget to put this

---------13:14----------
back on later and this board will come

---------13:17----------
back saying it works but I get a

---------13:19----------
question mark folder all the time now

---------13:21----------
you happen to know why that is no I have

---------13:27----------
no idea it's a bunch of little balls

---------13:33----------
shooting out from under the chip that's

---------13:35----------
a sign of quality soldering right there

---------13:37----------
oh you missed that it's a good thing you

---------13:39----------
missed it I have a chance to correct

---------13:41----------
that before you ever see it yeah

---------13:57----------
move out where I can catch you okay so a

---------14:05----------
bunch of questions to answer here is my

---------14:07----------
SMC any good no idea is my pp 3d for to

---------14:11----------
rail going to work now that I remove the

---------14:12----------
short no idea is the rest of the board

---------14:14----------
gonna work even if it turns on all good

---------14:18----------
questions and all stuff I'll be able to

---------14:19----------
answer in a few all right so I get a

---------14:21----------
green light now for the next test this

---------14:35----------
is the most important one of them all

---------14:37----------
there are some places before we started

---------14:39----------
doing this that we were outsourcing

---------14:40----------
boards too and the reason this is such a

---------14:42----------
long-running joke is because you know

---------14:45----------
they would go on and on about all the

---------14:46----------
procedures that they use the test boards

---------14:47----------
my personal favorite excuse

---------14:50----------
we sent aboard a long time ago to this

---------14:52----------
place that wasn't booting into the

---------14:54----------
operating system it would and that's

---------14:57----------
what we sent it for so they sent it back

---------14:58----------
saying that it was fixed and it still

---------15:02----------
did anyone please they send it back

---------15:03----------
saying that it was fixed and it

---------15:06----------
distilled in boo no nos so eventually

---------15:08----------
after a few months we managed to root

---------15:09----------
out of them that what they did is they

---------15:10----------
booted it into Windows seven because for

---------15:12----------
some reason I wasn't booting in a Mac OS

---------15:13----------
and because of that they said it was

---------15:15----------
fixed and it's like you you really do

---------15:19----------
dislike when the fan spins you guys are

---------15:21----------
done so that's why we have this running

---------15:23----------
joke that when the fan spins we're done

---------15:25----------
all right so it's still not turning on

---------15:27----------
so now we have to go through the power

---------15:28----------
rails and see what's missing and I also

---------15:29----------
want to see what state the computer

---------15:31----------
itself is in so is the machine entering

---------15:33----------
an Esso state now as I said on the newer

---------15:35----------
air boards this is one of us apples ways

---------15:37----------
are just making things harder I think

---------15:39----------
they used to have all the power diagram

---------15:40----------
and all the test points on page one two

---------15:42----------
or three of the schematic which kind of

---------15:44----------
makes sense because that's you know what

---------15:45----------
you're the first thing that you should

---------15:47----------
check for us put on the first page now

---------15:49----------
all that information is on page 64 you

---------15:56----------
[ __ ] all right

---------15:57----------
here we go so what I want to do here is

---------15:59----------
I want to see what state the machine is

---------16:00----------
entering S 5 s 3 s o so it could be that

---------16:04----------
the machine is actually trying to turn

---------16:05----------
on but there's one power wheel missing

---------16:06----------
or it could be this not trying to turn

---------16:08----------
on at all so if I see an S

---------16:10----------
the s3 power rails are missing arrests

---------16:12----------
you know then I know that it's not even

---------16:14----------
trying to turn on but this machine

---------16:16----------
itself is supposed to try to turn on as

---------16:18----------
soon as you plug it in all the core i5

---------16:19----------
and core i7 series MacBook Pros when you

---------16:21----------
plug the charger into the machine it's

---------16:23----------
supposed to just come and turn on which

---------16:24----------
means entering in Essos state so as five

---------16:26----------
is off as three is suspend when the

---------16:27----------
little light is blinking on the front

---------16:29----------
and s o is on so let's see if my Sol

---------16:33----------
power rails are present so let's just

---------16:34----------
see if let's let's find an SL power

---------16:36----------
let's say PP 3 V 3 SL let's see if that

---------16:38----------
one is present

---------16:49----------
windows 8 scaling sucks all right so

---------16:54----------
let's turn this around so where can I

---------17:00----------
measure P P 3 B 3 soo

---------17:12----------
this software could cause brain

---------17:14----------
hemorrhaging let's check over here

---------17:46----------
0.056 Oh interesting

---------17:49----------
let's try another Sol pp5 eso I would

---------17:52----------
expect it to be there and not be there

---------17:53----------
but not be there partially

---------18:08----------
peace

---------18:15----------
so pp5 VSO is not there all right so

---------18:21----------
it's not even trying to enter in s5

---------18:23----------
state I mean an Esso state well there's

---------18:31----------
a corrosion on another part of this

---------18:32----------
board here Yanks

---------18:43----------
that's not good all right so let's see

---------18:46----------
what these things are for I'm pretty

---------18:47----------
sure this for the five volt rail let's

---------18:50----------
go back to that's I don't want to see

---------18:52----------
that

---------19:04----------
No

---------19:13----------
r7 539 what's that for delete that

---------19:36----------
it's supposed to be 20 kilo ohms and 20

---------19:38----------
kilohms so before I go troubleshooting

---------19:45----------
this because this is the chip that

---------19:46----------
creates PP v V s for rs3 and also P P 3

---------19:50----------
V 3 s 5 before I troubleshoot any of

---------19:53----------
this because this could be one to being

---------19:54----------
a total waste of time

---------19:55----------
let's see if they're being told to turn

---------19:56----------
on let's also see if they're present so

---------19:58----------
P P 3 B 3 is 5 because again as nasty as

---------20:02----------
all that stuff looks if it's actually

---------20:03----------
working then that's that's not the area

---------20:05----------
to be looking pp 3 V 3 underscore s 5

---------20:21----------
so that's ship I was looking at and this

---------20:25----------
is where I'm gonna see it I imagine all

---------20:28----------
right remember to measure voltage put

---------20:35----------
the black probe in a screw hole and the

---------20:37----------
red probe on where you want to measure

---------20:40----------
so PP 3 B 3 as 5 is not being created

---------20:45----------
now PB 3 B 3 is one of the power rails

---------20:47----------
that's going to be used by the PCH for

---------20:51----------
certain logic Sophie B 3 B 3 as 5 is

---------20:52----------
missing it's not gonna try to enter an

---------20:54----------
Esso state because it can't try to enter

---------20:55----------
an Esso state so let's see what the

---------20:59----------
enable is for PP 3 B 3 s 5 let's see why

---------21:03----------
it's not turning on so PP 3 V 3 is 5

---------21:07----------
underscore en underscore R that comes

---------21:12----------
from s 5 power enable s 5 power enable

---------21:15----------
comes from s MC boo

---------21:20----------
all right let's see if s MC PMG 2 en is

---------21:23----------
there yeah yeah you've missed that

---------21:28----------
section so en - 4 PP 3 B 3 s 5 goes

---------21:34----------
through R 7 5 5 - so there's gonna be

---------21:36----------
voltage that comes to this chip over

---------21:37----------
here - and turn on that rail and

---------21:38----------
remember I'm not gonna troubleshoot this

---------21:40----------
entire [ __ ] and mess and test

---------21:42----------
every resistor and transistor before

---------21:43----------
seeing if the rail is even being told to

---------21:45----------
turn on so you go to s 5 power enable

---------21:48----------
and s 5 power enable here comes from the

---------21:51----------
SMC you saw up my SMC area look like

---------21:54----------
before so man let's see s please don't

---------21:58----------
be the SMC let's see is that signal

---------22:03----------
present my SMC is partially functional

---------22:05----------
you have to keep in mind that at least

---------22:07----------
that's it's getting something because I

---------22:09----------
have a green light but it still could be

---------22:10----------
dead it still could be bad so let's see

---------22:14----------
where can where can I get that no I

---------22:16----------
don't want to use my multimeter on the

---------22:18----------
ball into the SMC

---------22:19----------
how about yeah that bottom resistor yeah

---------22:27----------
you you

---------22:33----------
alright let's measure let's put the

---------22:36----------
charger plugged in it's very easy to

---------22:37----------
start seeing zero volts everywhere

---------22:39----------
because as I'm moving the board in the

---------22:40----------
desk I forget to plug the charger back

---------22:42----------
in

---------22:59----------
thank God all right the SMC is producing

---------23:02----------
it oh boy that would have sucked having

---------23:04----------
to read ball that okay so where does

---------23:06----------
this go next

---------23:07----------
so I checked the beginning and remember

---------23:09----------
I I don't like checking one point then

---------23:11----------
here then here then on and on I like I

---------23:13----------
check the beginning in the end and then

---------23:15----------
I'll go to the middle if I need to so

---------23:17----------
let's check and see if that is actually

---------23:19----------
getting to my chip so on pin one of our

---------23:23----------
seven five five two that should be there

---------23:24----------
I have our seven five five two

---------23:48----------
well that doesn't look nice which point

---------23:50----------
on this do you see the biggest red nasty

---------23:52----------
 see on the board view this is where

---------23:58----------
I'm checking and on the schematic this

---------24:00----------
is where inch mean on the actual

---------24:01----------
physical board itself this is its okay

---------24:06----------
so the three volts is making its way to

---------24:07----------
the chip so now I know that I can start

---------24:09----------
suspecting the chip because the chip

---------24:11----------
itself is being told to turn on I can

---------24:13----------
start suspecting the chip or a component

---------24:14----------
in The Associated area I remember again

---------24:17----------
if the chip is not being told to turn on

---------24:18----------
you don't replace you don't replace the

---------24:20----------
chip that makes three volts just because

---------24:21----------
you don't have three volts because very

---------24:22----------
often it's not being told to turn on so

---------24:26----------
let's see so now we start to look at the

---------24:30----------
area that's corroded and try to figure

---------24:33----------
out what is most likely messed up there

---------24:39----------
so let's say board view r7 539 we looked

---------24:49----------
at already that was 20 kilo ohms what's

---------24:51----------
next to it

---------24:52----------
c7 539 let's see if it's actually

---------25:01----------
possible to get a datasheet of what the

---------25:02----------
hell what everything on this chip does

---------25:04----------
so this is TPS five one nine eight zero

---------25:09----------
a let's make a new window and Chrome

---------25:15----------
what do you think the chances are that

---------25:17----------
we can actually find anything on this

---------25:42----------
yeah there's all right no not

---------25:47----------
much we can do there so let's try to

---------25:50----------
guess what this does Kampf

---------26:18----------
all I can guess is that it's comparing

---------26:20----------
something from the reference voltage

---------26:21----------
that's created by the LDO inside the

---------26:23----------
chip over here - but it's comparing it

---------26:26----------
to what SOCOM - so one pin of the chip

---------26:32----------
is attaching to another pin of the chip

---------26:34----------
but what for oh well okay so at this

---------26:38----------
point we're just going to turn brains

---------26:39----------
off and reserve the brains for later

---------26:41----------
because I don't have a datasheet and I

---------26:42----------
don't feel like driving myself nuts so

---------26:45----------
we're leaving brain mode and or entering

---------26:47----------
monkey replacement chip mode so let's

---------26:49----------
just we take this

---------27:06----------
bye-bye goodbye goodbye sayonara

---------27:52----------
righty

---------28:00----------
what a nice big mess with a minute I'm s

---------28:08----------
has a capacitor in the bottom of it to

---------28:10----------
look at that alright now this was not a

---------28:17----------
ten-second repair now I can charge you

---------28:21----------
more than $200 I'm thinking 400 maybe

---------28:31----------
let's have Steve with the agreement was

---------28:46----------
well this is gonna be a mess but Evan oh

---------28:48----------
well all can be fixed

---------29:01----------
that was atrocious soldering

---------29:04----------
atrocious and it's just gonna get worse

---------29:18----------
look at that nice big saddle ball I saw

---------29:22----------
her I went I also felt her went it hit

---------29:30----------
my pinkie as I was running off of the

---------29:31----------
bar not fast this thing gets hot

---------30:31----------
smc PMG to en was on this board meaning

---------30:35----------
that my SMC was not bad

---------30:36----------
god is good for the most part god is

---------30:41----------
good it would have really sucked if the

---------30:45----------
SMC were bad but sometimes just

---------30:48----------
sometimes he kind of smiles and gives me

---------30:50----------
a working SMC

---------31:00----------
 it ran away

---------31:17----------
this thing is too damn small I look at

---------31:27----------
that thing

---------31:27----------
look at the size of the tweezer and look

---------31:29----------
at the resistor

---------31:36----------
it's ridiculous but nice try

---------31:48----------


---------32:31----------
it's already gone before I even got it

---------32:33----------
there it's already gone

---------32:53----------
Pro points where you can test uh hurts

---------33:01----------
this is awful that looks like a

---------33:06----------
kindergarten I did it

---------33:20----------
that's the beauty of Amtech 5:59 you see

---------33:24----------
that now look the fight from kid to

---------33:28----------
guard a professional hey nobody looking

---------33:31----------
at this is to know that I suck boy that

---------33:36----------
looked nasty at one point so I'm

---------33:37----------
interested in seeing what that is right

---------33:42----------
here that's where PP 3 before to

---------33:46----------
underscore g3 hot comes into the chip to

---------33:48----------
create an s5 power good the reason I'm

---------33:51----------
interested in that is because that power

---------33:53----------
rail was missing and that was the one

---------33:55----------
that had the fluctuations on it because

---------33:56----------
of the short to ground so it makes sense

---------33:58----------
that that's corroded and I'm gonna check

---------34:01----------
and make sure that that is present on

---------34:03----------
the other side of this cuz here's the

---------34:04----------
other thing so I was looking for enables

---------34:06----------
right it was actually a very good chance

---------34:08----------
that that resisted that I didn't check

---------34:09----------
was the one that was bad and the chip

---------34:10----------
was good so even though the chip was

---------34:11----------
being told to turn on watch you know

---------34:14----------
that this chip was being tilt are told

---------34:15----------
to turn on before it before it will

---------34:17----------
actually turn on and wants to see that a

---------34:18----------
power a good signal is present so there

---------34:20----------
are different power good signals at

---------34:21----------
different points in the machine for

---------34:23----------
example let's say on a retina board the

---------34:33----------
PCH will want to see p.m. PCH power ok

---------34:36----------
come in if it doesn't see that it won't

---------34:38----------
turn on the machine and over here that

---------34:40----------
resistor is for as five power ok so the

---------34:44----------
way this works is the s5 rails won't

---------34:46----------
turn on without PP 3 v 4 to 1 to square

---------34:48----------
g 3 op coming up sequence is also

---------34:50----------
important so let's see so that's our 81

---------34:53----------
41 cs5 nice try open broadcaster said S

---------35:04----------
5 power good that goes to the SMC it

---------35:14----------
also goes to this month's not changing

---------35:16----------
the screen it also goes to this chip

---------35:18----------
sure it doesn't go to this chip it goes

---------35:20----------
it comes out of this chip I guess I

---------35:23----------
guess PP 3 V 4 - is a pull-up for it

---------35:25----------
either way without that there it kind of

---------35:27----------
screwed

---------35:29----------
so let's I didn't do a good job of

---------35:35----------
explaining that this let's just clean

---------35:38----------
this area a little bit bunch of put it

---------35:45----------
in focus you can see so I just kind of

---------35:47----------
had the flux there so I just heated it

---------35:49----------
and it moved a bunch of small components

---------35:51----------
that I poorly soldered back into place

---------35:56----------
to clean up some of the shorts from the

---------35:58----------
poor soldering from before was a short

---------36:01----------
on that side I saw this side wasn't

---------36:03----------
really soldered that great okay that

---------36:07----------
short has cleaned up the site is

---------36:14----------
soldered on

---------36:27----------
yeah what have I done the thing I'm

---------36:32----------
using to clean my soldering iron has

---------36:34----------
more solder on it than the motherboard

---------36:35----------
does

---------37:02----------
all right let's see if we have any

---------37:04----------
changes and also since I have PP 3d for

---------37:06----------
- I can finally remove these wires power

---------37:09----------
supply wires from the board

---------37:22----------
so that means I get to charge more yeah

---------37:30----------
Rita

---------37:54----------
and we're done so let's go over what God

---------38:00----------
fixed here first

---------38:01----------
P P 3 V 4 2 which is the main power rail

---------38:03----------
required for the 1 wire circuit was

---------38:05----------
shorted to ground because of capacitors

---------38:07----------
by the SMC after that was done the all

---------38:10----------
es 5 power rails were not turning on it

---------38:12----------
could have been because the chip was bad

---------38:13----------
it could have been because that little

---------38:15----------
resistor that I replaced was bad

---------38:16----------
sometimes I don't really care what the

---------38:18----------
actual problem is I just care about

---------38:19----------
solving it as quickly as I can so once I

---------38:22----------
saw that that area was corroded and that

---------38:24----------
that's and that my s 5 rails were not

---------38:25----------
coming up well first I saw that my a so

---------38:27----------
rails weren't coming up in there

---------38:28----------
supposed to so I started looking for the

---------38:30----------
ones that were higher like the s 5 ones

---------38:31----------
the S 5 one wasn't coming on so I

---------38:34----------
checked the chip that controls the S 5

---------38:35----------
rails it was receiving the enable

---------38:37----------
signals to receive those as five rails

---------38:39----------
the power good signal was not coming out

---------38:41----------
of the chip so at that point you kind of

---------38:43----------
blame the chip and the things around it

---------38:44----------
that are corroded we replaced and we're

---------38:46----------
good again do I need to test this any

---------38:49----------
further is there anything I have to do

---------38:51----------
like boot it into Windows and say that

---------38:53----------
it's good not even that the fans fun

---------38:56----------
we're done all right so this is what

---------39:00----------
that same motherboard looks like after

---------39:01----------
the ultrasonic cleaner so this is the

---------39:04----------
TPS five or nine eight zero area I'm not

---------39:07----------
gonna say that it's perfect but as you

---------39:09----------
can see even though I'm really really

---------39:11----------
bad at soldering small components all I

---------39:13----------
really care about is that I get the

---------39:15----------
component on the board once it's on the

---------39:17----------
board I don't care how straight it is

---------39:18----------
I'm gonna use that am tech 559 and hot

---------39:21----------
air and it's gonna move it in a place so

---------39:22----------
it's going to look like I am perfect at

---------39:25----------
soldering I mean really this this this

---------39:27----------
has a very factory ish feel to it you

---------39:29----------
would have no idea that a complete idiot

---------39:31----------
worked on this motherboard which is

---------39:33----------
pretty cool
