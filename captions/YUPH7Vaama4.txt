---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna be going

---------00:01----------
over a retina that is completely dead so

---------00:04----------
first thing I'm gonna do here just wipe

---------00:05----------
off the desk before I start a little bit

---------00:07----------
of Windex and a paper towel Windex is

---------00:09----------
one of those things that I love using on

---------00:11----------
almost everything alrighty now that

---------00:23----------
that's done let's see what's going on

---------00:26----------
with this retina board now first thing

---------00:29----------
I'm gonna try doing is I'm going to take

---------00:31----------
my charger and plug it in what do I get

---------00:36----------
I get no light what's the first thing

---------00:39----------
that I have to check if I have no light

---------00:40----------
the first thing that I have to check if

---------00:42----------
you've watched my video is on what power

---------00:44----------
rail comes first the importance of

---------00:45----------
sequence and my one wire circuit videos

---------00:47----------
is that P P 3 V 4 to underscore g3 Han

---------00:50----------
has to come first so let's take a look

---------00:52----------
and try to see if we have that on this

---------00:54----------
board so I'm just gonna take my

---------00:56----------
multimeter and turn it because with this

---------00:57----------
cool new camera angle you might actually

---------00:59----------
stand a chance at seeing what the

---------01:01----------
is on my desk there we go BAM

---------01:04----------
okay voltage also for all those people

---------01:08----------
that say superglue is not something that

---------01:10----------
you should use for repair and I remember

---------01:12----------
there's this one total [ __ ] that said

---------01:13----------
the three years ago like I should not be

---------01:15----------
in repair of electronics because I used

---------01:17----------
superglue there is a use for it

---------01:20----------
this multimeter thing kept falling down

---------01:22----------
because I've dropped it so many times

---------01:23----------
that I up the entire base of the

---------01:25----------
back this is now super glued in place so

---------01:28----------
that I don't worry about falling all the

---------01:29----------
time so anyway let's move on here PP 3 V

---------01:35----------
4 2 is the rail that has to come up

---------01:37----------
first so how do I find PP 3 V 4 2 you

---------01:39----------
may be wondering if you're a new viewer

---------01:41----------
to the channel well let me show you over

---------01:43----------
here with the board view software how I

---------01:46----------
would find that and if you don't know

---------01:48----------
why I need that so rail come first I

---------01:50----------
would highly suggest you check out my

---------01:51----------
older videos like my 1 wire circuit

---------01:53----------
videos where I go over this in great

---------01:55----------
detail but we're not gonna do that just

---------01:58----------
right now so now we're gonna move over

---------02:00----------
to here I still haven't figured out why

---------02:02----------
I'm capturing it one frame per second

---------02:04----------
when it comes to this so when it comes

---------02:06----------
to the screen view but there's always

---------02:09----------
something broken

---------02:09----------
I fixed one thing supposedly fixed by

---------02:12----------
fixed I mean I stopped seeing the

---------02:13----------
problem

---------02:13----------
so I'm taking credit for it which is

---------02:15----------
where the microscope camera had a

---------02:17----------
banding but not banding it was tearing

---------02:21----------
that was it what it was so we're gonna

---------02:22----------
check for PP 3 before 2 over here and

---------02:26----------
let's see what I get so ok I'm gonna

---------02:28----------
switch back so you can see this let's

---------02:32----------
see what I get over here so 4 on PP 3 V

---------02:35----------
4 - it's there I see it alright

---------02:42----------
now let's follow and try to figure out

---------02:45----------
what's going on here so I'm gonna go

---------02:47----------
over the 1 wire section let's see and

---------02:51----------
how this works I'm gonna explain this

---------02:54----------
very very quickly because I've explained

---------02:56----------
that a lot of times already and there's

---------02:57----------
only so many times that I can say the

---------02:59----------
same thing before I just get really

---------03:00----------
tired of it this is a logic gate this is

---------03:04----------
going to allow PP 3 V 4 - 2 which is 3

---------03:07----------
point 42 volts the power this chip when

---------03:10----------
smc bc AC ok which i have been

---------03:12----------
incorrectly calling a for a year

---------03:14----------
and a half of doing this channel as

---------03:16----------
present it's going to well out this chip

---------03:18----------
to turn off once this chip has power on

---------03:20----------
its VCC pin by the way when you want to

---------03:22----------
know what what VCC means VC C's is like

---------03:25----------
this like this is this is the you can't

---------03:27----------
see this is my microscope camera right

---------03:29----------
it has one of those wall wart power

---------03:31----------
supplies that plug into it this is the

---------03:32----------
power so this over here where I'm

---------03:35----------
plugging in the power supply to my

---------03:36----------
camera that's a VCC pin that's you can

---------03:38----------
call that a VCC pin it makes it easy I'm

---------03:40----------
sir some engineer will tell me why I'm

---------03:42----------
wrong with that but off now moving

---------03:45----------
back to the schematic over here if we

---------03:47----------
see the 3 point 4 volts over here I can

---------03:50----------
automatically not check for this not

---------03:51----------
check for this not see if this is

---------03:53----------
working I'm just gonna kind of skip

---------03:54----------
ahead and check on you 7000 to see that

---------03:56----------
this chip is working the reason I'm

---------03:57----------
interested in this trip is because this

---------03:58----------
chip is what's going to allow adapter

---------04:00----------
sense from the charger which is aka

---------04:02----------
sense the charger sends the charger turn

---------04:04----------
the light green and the charger and turn

---------04:06----------
the on it's going to allow this to

---------04:08----------
talk to the SMC so see we have X tan int

---------04:10----------
x over here stands for external like the

---------04:14----------
charger in stands for internal like

---------04:16----------
talking to the computer so sis one wire

---------04:19----------
let's just take a look here so sis one

---------04:21----------
wire is going to be a line that talks to

---------04:24----------
this chip you 5,000 which is the SMC the

---------04:26----------
system management

---------04:27----------
controller so let's take a look at you

---------04:30----------
7,000 and see what's going on here so if

---------04:32----------
this chip has three volt point three

---------04:35----------
volts over here on the VCC and pin four

---------04:37----------
3.42 I got that wrong

---------04:38----------
and this resistor is not blown then I

---------04:41----------
can kind of assume that that my problem

---------04:44----------
is either with the SMC the charge port

---------04:47----------
something like that but let's just try

---------04:48----------
to rule this stuff out again I'm not

---------04:50----------
going to check this right now because if

---------04:51----------
I check this and this is good if I check

---------04:53----------
the u 7000 and it has voltage on pin 1 I

---------04:56----------
know that all this stuff is already good

---------04:58----------
because this chips job is the sent power

---------05:00----------
to that one so let's go over that let's

---------05:03----------
also add a scene and open broadcaster so

---------05:05----------
that you can see multiple things at the

---------05:07----------
same time here we go so you're gonna be

---------05:09----------
able to see my multimeter as well as my

---------05:11----------
microscope camera now and the mic result

---------05:15----------
amita is gonna go out of focus as I move

---------05:17----------
my face I have to get a remote

---------05:20----------
control for them anyway we have u 7000

---------05:24----------
down here or we're here here we go

---------05:29----------
yeah I'm losing so first let me just see

---------05:31----------
which pin is gonna be the VCC pin for u

---------05:34----------
7000 the VCC pin for u 7000 is going to

---------05:44----------
be pin over here so pin 1 which is here

---------05:51----------
there 3.3 all right go figure

---------05:55----------
nothing easy with us nothing easy here

---------05:57----------
so let's go over and talk a little bit

---------06:00----------
about the SMC now as I've said in other

---------06:02----------
videos there's a signal called SMC

---------06:05----------
underscore reset underscore L which

---------06:08----------
means that the reset signal will be

---------06:09----------
asserted as long as the voltage is low

---------06:12----------
so the SMC itself is not going to turn

---------06:16----------
on immediately with the machine the pp 3

---------06:19----------
before 2 rail is a very fussy and

---------06:20----------
annoying rail it takes a little bit of

---------06:22----------
time before it gets to exactly 3.42

---------06:24----------
volts so way this works so that the SMC

---------06:28----------
doesn't wind up just not working or

---------06:30----------
crashing is that there's going to be a

---------06:32----------
chip in between the power supply and the

---------06:35----------
and the SMC was I just talking about

---------06:42----------
what page was i on here

---------06:49----------
yes so there's going to be a chip that

---------06:52----------
sits in between the SMC and the chip

---------06:56----------
that creates pp3 before to the entire

---------06:58----------
purpose of this is that chip that sits

---------06:59----------
in between is going to say okay I'm

---------07:01----------
gonna wait for 3.42 volts to stabilize

---------07:03----------
and be a nice flat voltage instead of a

---------07:06----------
fluctuating mess and then once that has

---------07:08----------
stabilized I will release the SMC reset

---------07:12----------
signal and allow the SMC to turn on

---------07:14----------
think of it like your desktop computer

---------07:16----------
so on your desktop computer you may have

---------07:18----------
a button that says power and a button

---------07:20----------
that says reset if you have some really

---------07:22----------
old computer now you hit the reset

---------07:24----------
button and it resets but what happens if

---------07:26----------
you hold the reset button down often if

---------07:28----------
you hold the reset button down the

---------07:30----------
computer never turns on it's on but it's

---------07:32----------
not posting it's not doing anything it's

---------07:34----------
just stuck in that state

---------07:36----------
so before blaming the SMC here because

---------07:39----------
very often people will blame the SMC

---------07:41----------
let's take a little bit of a look into

---------07:43----------
how the SMC is turned on so I'm gonna go

---------07:48----------
over to what was I just doing okay so

---------07:57----------
we're checking you 7,000 and see if it

---------07:58----------
has three volts okay so first we have to

---------08:03----------
check you 7,000 to see that it has three

---------08:05----------
volts let's do that here now if this has

---------08:08----------
three volts I won't have to check the U

---------08:10----------
seven zero zero one section so let's

---------08:13----------
switch over here to wait and see what

---------08:15----------
voltage that is

---------08:30----------
now help if I plugged in the damn

---------08:32----------
machine

---------08:40----------
okay so that's there so what do we check

---------08:42----------
next now most of the time people would

---------08:45----------
be adept to blame the SMC they would say

---------08:47----------
that the SMC is bad because everything

---------08:49----------
here is present but what I want you to

---------08:50----------
think about is what is going to actually

---------08:52----------
turn the SMC on so let's go over an

---------08:54----------
older schematic where this may make some

---------08:55----------
more sense let's go over to the first

---------08:58----------
page of an older schematic the reason I

---------08:59----------
say the older one makes more sense is

---------09:01----------
because it's on the older schematic that

---------09:02----------
they actually include this diagram that

---------09:04----------
they don't include with the new one

---------09:05----------
because it would take an extra ten

---------09:07----------
minutes of work to draw it and you know

---------09:09----------
 if Apple actually fixes any other

---------09:11----------
 anyway so not like they have to

---------09:12----------
care so let's go over this schematic

---------09:15----------
here so this is the SMC right now the

---------09:19----------
SMC is powered by PP 3 V 4 - that's one

---------09:22----------
of its primary rails that it needs so

---------09:24----------
you have this little diagram and you see

---------09:26----------
P P 3 V 4 2 is created by you $69.99 it

---------09:29----------
goes to this Sigma this chip which has

---------09:31----------
SMC power good which releases SMC reset

---------09:34----------
hell and from SMC reset L that makes its

---------09:36----------
way over to the SMC so if we look at

---------09:40----------
this why am i on the schematic this is

---------09:47----------
not even the right motherboard

---------09:49----------
I'm sorry looking at this one

---------09:56----------
well this one doesn't have a diagram so

---------09:58----------
I'm using this alright so SMC reset L is

---------10:03----------
going to sit in between the PP 3 V 4 -

---------10:06----------
power supply and also the SMC and the

---------10:09----------
whole idea here is that the SMC reset

---------10:12----------
signal is not going to be released until

---------10:15----------
PP 3 before 2 is stabilized and is 3.42

---------10:18----------
volts nice and flat no waving no ripple

---------10:21----------
no spike because if the pen if this has

---------10:23----------
not stabilized let's say P P 3 P 4 - for

---------10:26----------
a quick second is 4 volts 2 volts 5

---------10:28----------
volts 1 ball whatever it is the SMC is

---------10:30----------
one of those trips that's just it's a

---------10:31----------
dumb chip it's going to try to turn on

---------10:33----------
immediately and if it turns on

---------10:35----------
immediately with the improper voltage

---------10:36----------
it's going to up and die and stop

---------10:38----------
working and nothing's gonna work right

---------10:39----------
so this SMC reset signal sits in between

---------10:42----------
here and the SMC and the entire idea

---------10:45----------
here is that it's not going to allow the

---------10:46----------
SMC to turn on until a second or two is

---------10:49----------
passed and PP 3 V 4 - is stabilized now

---------10:52----------
this is very similar to the reset button

---------10:54----------
on your computer so you may have a reset

---------10:55----------
button on the front of your computer and

---------10:57----------
on the front of your computer if you

---------10:58----------
hold that reset button down you'll

---------11:00----------
notice that computer never actually does

---------11:02----------
anything because the reset signal is

---------11:04----------
being asserted so if you hold that

---------11:05----------
resets button down for a minute

---------11:07----------
your computer is on but it's not

---------11:08----------
actually gonna boot or do anything

---------11:09----------
because the reset button is asserted the

---------11:12----------
whole idea here is that's a button and

---------11:14----------
you click really quickly it's not

---------11:15----------
supposed to be a button that you hold

---------11:16----------
down now I want you to look at the name

---------11:20----------
nomenclatures that's the right word

---------11:22----------
naming here you look at the name here

---------11:24----------
the SMC reset signal ends with an

---------11:26----------
underscore L that means if the reset

---------11:28----------
signal is going to be asserted so long

---------11:30----------
as it's low now let's try to get an idea

---------11:32----------
of what low or high would mean here by

---------11:34----------
going at you 50 10 which is that signal

---------11:37----------
that that signal that is that which

---------11:49----------
you fifty 10 is that ship responsible

---------11:51----------
for us I'm serious Adele so let's just

---------11:53----------
go over there and try to figure out what

---------11:54----------
high or low would be now this chip

---------11:56----------
receives PP 3 V 3 S 5 as V N and P P

---------12:01----------
even s 5 s MC v RF whatever which says

---------12:05----------
three point four here so this is three

---------12:07----------
point three this is three point four so

---------12:10----------
I'm going to make the uneducated and

---------12:12----------
college dropouts guess that three point

---------12:15----------
three or three point 4 volts is high and

---------12:17----------
anything that's considerably below that

---------12:19----------
is low so let's check SMC reset l on

---------12:22----------
this other board which is the one that

---------12:25----------
I'm working on all right so we're gonna

---------12:28----------
go over here SMC underscore reset

---------12:32----------
underscore ell and okay so it shows up

---------12:38----------
over here so let's kind of see what this

---------12:41----------
is

---------12:53----------
okay move the microscope over

---------13:11----------
so it's right here one volt does that

---------13:19----------
look like 3.3 or 3.42 to you because it

---------13:22----------
don't look like 3.3 or 3.4 to me now

---------13:25----------
there's a couple of things that could be

---------13:26----------
wrong here and let's try to measure and

---------13:27----------
find out what they are and you got to

---------13:29----------
think logically it's not that hard to

---------13:31----------
use your brain a little bit I don't

---------13:34----------
even have one and I managed to use mine

---------13:36----------
so let's just switch back over to the

---------13:38----------
schematic over here and let's take a

---------13:41----------
look at the SMC reset l I see so in

---------13:45----------
order for this piece of crap to work the

---------13:51----------
SMC on off L should probably be high

---------13:53----------
means I'm not hitting the button SMC on

---------13:55----------
off L is the button that you hit in

---------13:57----------
order to actually turn the machine on or

---------14:01----------
off so the whole idea here is that when

---------14:02----------
the signal is low that means I'm hitting

---------14:03----------
the power button now you know how you

---------14:05----------
can do an SMC reset you can do an SMC

---------14:07----------
reset I holding the power button down so

---------14:10----------
do I want to be doing an SMC reset no I

---------14:13----------
want to be getting rid of that signal

---------14:14----------
all together I want SMC reset to be high

---------14:16----------
which means I don't want SMC on-off l to

---------14:19----------
be stuck low so let's we're gonna be

---------14:21----------
checking that okay so we start back here

---------14:25----------
and I was here we go

---------14:28----------
so SMC on off L that has to be high

---------14:30----------
because if it's stuck low the computers

---------14:33----------
gonna think I'm holding the power button

---------14:33----------
down holding the power button down is

---------14:35----------
what causes the SMC to be reset that's

---------14:38----------
one of the ways you can reset the SMC so

---------14:39----------
that's one of the things I want to check

---------14:41----------
does the chip have actual power going

---------14:43----------
into it maybe the signal is low because

---------14:45----------
the chip does not have power going into

---------14:47----------
it maybe that a hundred kilometres

---------14:48----------
that's being used as a pull up resistor

---------14:50----------
let's just switch back here because

---------14:51----------
if you need to see my face while I'm

---------14:53----------
talking about a diagram

---------14:54----------
hey we're recording so let's say hey

---------14:57----------
that this is blown this little resistor

---------15:00----------
or the trays could be blown or SMC on

---------15:02----------
off L could be stuck low so I'm gonna

---------15:04----------
check a few things I'm gonna check this

---------15:05----------
resistor to make sure that the pull-up

---------15:06----------
resistor has voltage on the top of it

---------15:08----------
and I'm also going to check to see if

---------15:10----------
SMC on off L is low or a high so I'm

---------15:13----------
gonna be interested in checking pins

---------15:14----------
seven and I'm also going to be

---------15:16----------
interested and check I'm not interested

---------15:18----------
in checking the SMC trackpad reset

---------15:20----------
signal right now because the trackpad is

---------15:22----------
not even connected

---------15:23----------
I honestly forget how this part works I

---------15:26----------
shouldn't say that but I yeah I

---------15:28----------
legitimately forget how this part works

---------15:30----------
so hopefully it's not that okay

---------15:50----------
okay

---------15:59----------
all right so let's shrink this uncheck

---------16:02----------
pin seven

---------16:03----------
let's find pin seven all right so pin

---------16:07----------
seven let's see if SMC on/off is stuck

---------16:10----------
low because that would cause the SMC

---------16:11----------
reset signal it asserted SMC reset how

---------16:20----------
SMC reset L is at 3.3 volts not SMC

---------16:26----------
reset L SMC on-off L is at 3.3 volts so

---------16:29----------
that's not causing it

---------16:31----------
let's check pins 1 & 2 of the chip with

---------16:33----------
1 & 3 let's make sure power is actually

---------16:35----------
going into it pin 1 is there and 3 is

---------16:42----------
there so power is going into the chip

---------16:44----------
and lastly let's check the other side of

---------16:46----------
that pull-up resistor one side is 1 volt

---------16:52----------
the other side has 3.3 okay

---------16:55----------
now let's analyze this logically

---------16:57----------
remember use your brain so the chip has

---------17:00----------
power going into it none of the inputs

---------17:02----------
into the chip are telling it to keep SMC

---------17:05----------
reset low the pull-up resistor whose

---------17:07----------
responsibility it is to hold SMC reset

---------17:10----------
high unless the chip wants to pull it

---------17:11----------
down itself is has 3.3 volts on the top

---------17:15----------
side of it do I replace the chip or is

---------17:18----------
something else wrong

---------17:19----------
most likely the chip there is a very

---------17:22----------
small chance and I say small chance

---------17:24----------
because I got trolled with this in an

---------17:25----------
earlier one is that the SMC itself is

---------17:27----------
bad and the SMC itself being bad is

---------17:30----------
what's pulling down SMC reset l but

---------17:32----------
usually when you see SMC reset L being

---------17:34----------
pulled down particularly on this circuit

---------17:36----------
with this u 5110 chip and this s MC

---------17:39----------
usually when that's the case you're

---------17:41----------
going to see that the SMC reset L signal

---------17:44----------
is something like zero point five seven

---------17:46----------
four zero point five a 1 somewhere

---------17:48----------
around there since I weigh C one volt

---------17:50----------
that's a little bit I don't know I kind

---------17:52----------
of feel like I got a different problem

---------17:53----------
here because often when these things

---------17:55----------
fail they failed kind of pattern so what

---------17:56----------
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove this

---------17:57----------
and I'm gonna replace it and let's see

---------17:59----------
if SMC reset all goes back up now you

---------18:01----------
may ask why am i replacing that this

---------18:03----------
instead of replacing the SMC

---------18:05----------
if the SMC could also be at fault do I

---------18:08----------
want to replace a chip with eight legs

---------18:10----------
or 96 balls if this is an equal chance

---------18:12----------
of either

---------18:12----------
one of them being bad which would you

---------18:14----------
rather replace I would most certainly

---------18:16----------
rather take my chances on the eight

---------18:19----------
legged one rather than the 52 bald one

---------18:22----------
but that's just me now let's turn it on

---------18:26----------
and let's get to work

---------18:31----------
turn on the fume extractor so it'll in

---------18:33----------
hell this righty

---------18:48----------
now

---------19:06----------
I love this JBC it takes things off so

---------19:09----------
quickly

---------19:17----------
it's amazing

---------19:22----------
get rid of the lead free buy lead free

---------19:25----------
could buy lead free could buy lead free

---------19:28----------
too much solder on the center pad I'm

---------19:33----------
gonna start doing that regularly is this

---------19:38----------
one Fitness channel where the sky trolls

---------19:39----------
everybody his name is Jason blah ha

---------19:41----------
and one of the things that he does is

---------19:44----------
because everybody you know they're

---------19:45----------
always people are trolling his

---------19:46----------
appearance and this that and the other

---------19:48----------
and he had some piece of his bicep I

---------19:50----------
don't know the entire thing it could be

---------19:51----------
wrong here so he got some piece of his

---------19:52----------
bicep removed surgically because he

---------19:54----------
 it up in some way so at the end

---------19:56----------
of every video he says I'm gonna give

---------19:57----------
you a bicep shot before I go and he

---------19:59----------
makes this funny little noise as he's

---------20:01----------
doing the bicep shot it's a Fitness

---------20:02----------
channel and the whole idea I kind of

---------20:05----------
think to him is that he's kind of count

---------20:06----------
he's trolling the idiots that are making

---------20:10----------
fun of his by step without realizing

---------20:12----------
that he had surgery on it and especially

---------20:14----------
since most of the idiots who are making

---------20:15----------
fun of it are people who they themselves

---------20:17----------
probably could not lift as well as he

---------20:20----------
could you know I'm not necessarily

---------20:22----------
endorsing the channel I'm just kind of

---------20:24----------
saying all the information you find on

---------20:25----------
it but I'm just saying that that's one

---------20:27----------
of those things and I kind of feel like

---------20:29----------
this whole solder and the center pad

---------20:30----------
here I think what I'm doing is it's kind

---------20:32----------
of like a subconscious way of giving a

---------20:35----------
nice middle finger to I PC certification

---------20:37----------
and all those trolls it is always having

---------20:40----------
a middle Center pad that is too much

---------20:42----------
solder on it I don't matter I just suck

---------20:45----------
that good to suck that could be a big

---------20:49----------
part of it that's fine

---------20:55----------
that was a pretty bad job right there

---------20:57----------
we're gonna come back and save it though

---------20:59----------
it gives a that it was a bad job as

---------21:03----------
long as you're still alive you can fix

---------21:05----------
it all I want it to be nice and flat on

---------21:09----------
the board we put a little flux and I use

---------21:11----------
this T v what is T T 30 - KN that's what

---------21:18----------
it is this is the T 30 - K n tip aka I

---------21:21----------
like to call this the corrector because

---------21:23----------
it fixes all of my it's a great

---------21:26----------
tip

---------21:33----------
it's a little harder than usual come on

---------21:37----------
up there we go BAM okay

---------21:45----------
now let's plug you in and see if we have

---------21:48----------
any difference in the SMC reset signal

---------21:53----------
plugging it in

---------21:55----------
we are gonna measure the SMC reset

---------21:58----------
signal

---------22:05----------
smc reset is 1.1 which means either bad

---------22:09----------
SMC or corrosion under the SMC so let's

---------22:12----------
kind of let's get ready to tackle that

---------22:15----------
now you understand why I tried the other

---------22:17----------
chip first though there's a pretty good

---------22:21----------
chance it could be either

---------22:32----------
okay

---------22:37----------
so first things first is to remove the

---------22:39----------
edge bonding I'm gonna heat from far

---------22:45----------
away because I want the board to be warm

---------22:46----------
here all right this is another thing

---------22:49----------
that's good about ultrasonic cleaning if

---------22:50----------
I get any little bits of solder stuck on

---------22:53----------
the board kind of corrects me and

---------22:55----------
removes stuff like that the whole idea

---------22:58----------
is not to really dig I don't want to dig

---------23:00----------
I just kind of want to naturally nudge

---------23:02----------
it off the board should be warm enough

---------23:05----------
that it's easy to naturally nudge this

---------23:06----------
 off see if I can follow my own

---------23:09----------
advice

---------23:17----------
he in the heat

---------23:23----------
okay now I'm going to put the heat down

---------23:26----------
and do this and let's go I'm off in one

---------23:36----------
piece here we go I want it to come off

---------23:38----------
in one piece so that it doesn't leave

---------23:40----------
any of that under the chip because

---------23:41----------
if I do that and I reflow it it combines

---------23:44----------
with the balls and then the balls

---------23:46----------
combine with the edge bonding and you

---------23:48----------
never want your balls to combine with

---------23:50----------
your edge bonding

---------24:51----------
okay you got some flux down there and

---------24:55----------
now for the heating now by all means

---------24:58----------
take it microscope take your

---------25:01----------
time with the heating take your sweet

---------25:04----------
time doing it from nice and far away the

---------25:13----------
board's here you see my finger is board

---------25:16----------
is here heater is there nice distance on

---------25:19----------
it I want the board to be warm not the

---------25:22----------
chip the heat from far enough away that

---------25:25----------
the board is gonna be absorbing a lot of

---------25:27----------
my heat and the flux is gonna go from

---------25:31----------
being this chunky stuff to acting like

---------25:33----------
water you know I do this border pair

---------25:39----------
will be a piece of from the moment

---------25:40----------
I took it out of the box because it was

---------25:42----------
prepaid I don't know what it is

---------25:43----------
karmically but every every border pair

---------25:45----------
that's prepaid is it's like an SMC it's

---------25:47----------
a quarter fan spin it's a dead piece eh

---------25:49----------
it's like everyone know that or it's

---------25:56----------
like a no back light thing but it's a no

---------25:57----------
back light thing where they ripped

---------25:58----------
everything and they're you know how it

---------26:01----------
is now once I get to a point where

---------26:06----------
there's like a barely it to see how this

---------26:08----------
looks like a really indistinguishable

---------26:09----------
little puddle right around the chip once

---------26:12----------
I'm there that's the point at which I'm

---------26:13----------
willing to go in and then really start

---------26:15----------
heating

---------26:31----------
I want to move it but I want to move it

---------26:33----------
enough that I can actually see it dance

---------26:35----------
see how it's dancing dance dance dance

---------26:37----------
it's moving and I tapped it a little

---------26:39----------
before that happens so I know that I

---------26:40----------
know that the center balls have melted

---------26:42----------
as well as the outer ones it's easier to

---------26:44----------
melt the outer balls than it is to melt

---------26:45----------
the center balls because they're closer

---------26:49----------
to the source of the heat after that's

---------26:51----------
done my high-tech cooling technique

---------27:00----------
that's high tech and this

---------27:10----------
it's also a bit to get rid of the excess

---------27:12----------
flux while it's still hot

---------27:13----------
it's gonna get ultrasonically cleaned

---------27:15----------
anyway but you know in terms of flux

---------27:17----------
removal its easiest to remove that stuff

---------27:19----------
while it's still hot so let's see if

---------27:21----------
this piece of decides to work now I

---------27:24----------
plug in the charger I measure SMC oh we

---------27:30----------
have a light BAM

---------27:33----------
okay so that was corrosion unto the SMC

---------27:35----------
see we got orange light now let's see if

---------27:38----------
we have a fan spin do we have a fan spin

---------27:45----------
can you see that huh here we go so let's

---------27:54----------
go over what we did and why that so

---------28:04----------
we didn't have a green light on the

---------28:06----------
charger the first thing I check there is

---------28:08----------
to see if PP 3 V 4 2 is present one of

---------28:11----------
the things that I tell all of you is to

---------28:12----------
check the beginning and the end of a

---------28:14----------
circuit rather than following every

---------28:15----------
single little step because it will waste

---------28:17----------
a lot of time if you do it that way so

---------28:19----------
let me just go back over here and show

---------28:21----------
you where within the one wire circuit by

---------28:23----------
the way if you haven't you don't know

---------28:24----------
what the 1 wire circuit is and you want

---------28:25----------
to understand this video watch the 1

---------28:27----------
wire circuit video is it's short it's

---------28:28----------
simple I try to not ramble which is you

---------28:31----------
know challenge if you're me and

---------28:32----------
let's just go over that so so the first

---------28:37----------
thing that I need for the 1 wire circuit

---------28:39----------
to work at the beginning is pp 3 V 4 2

---------28:42----------
right so I measure that pp 3 before - as

---------28:44----------
present now at the end of it I check to

---------28:47----------
see that V s-- that there's power here

---------28:50----------
again I don't check out some CBC AC ok I

---------28:52----------
don't check where it comes from I don't

---------28:53----------
check any of that

---------28:54----------
I see pp 3 before 2 is there now we skip

---------28:57----------
ahead to SMC to this once I saw that

---------29:01----------
chip is being powered on I knew that the

---------29:03----------
charger was being allowed to talk to the

---------29:05----------
SMC it must better the SMC is not

---------29:07----------
listening so is the SMC broken is the

---------29:10----------
SMC corroded is the SMC up in any

---------29:13----------
way good questions

---------29:15----------
now what turns on the SMC as I showed

---------29:17----------
you in this previous diagram back from

---------29:19----------
when Apple actually included this diet

---------29:21----------
this power system architecture diagram

---------29:23----------
inside of this diagram you'll see that

---------29:26----------
pp 3 v 4 2 goes to the ship that creates

---------29:28----------
SMC reset L which then goes to the SMC I

---------29:31----------
checked there all the conditions were

---------29:33----------
present for SMC reset L to be high but

---------29:35----------
it wasn't so I replaced as to this SMC

---------29:37----------
reset l creation ship and it did nothing

---------29:39----------
then I figured out at that point I can

---------29:42----------
only assume either the SMC is bad the

---------29:45----------
SMC is not receiving power or the SMC is

---------29:47----------
corroded I can't check to see if the SMC

---------29:50----------
is receiving power necessarily because I

---------29:52----------
would have to check the pads under the

---------29:53----------
chip so we cross out that in

---------29:54----------
troubleshooting I can't check to see if

---------29:57----------
the SMC

---------29:57----------
well I can't know if the SMC is bad

---------29:59----------
without replacing it so we also put that

---------30:01----------
all the way at the end in the

---------30:03----------
troubleshooting and figuring out if the

---------30:05----------
SMC has corrosion under under it is as

---------30:07----------
simple as just doing a quick reflow with

---------30:10----------
some flux the great part about this

---------30:11----------
stuff is not just the fact that it

---------30:13----------
allows flux to flow it also cleans out

---------30:15----------
the dirt and the that may be

---------30:16----------
hiding under

---------30:17----------
think about how flux worked the whole

---------30:18----------
idea is to remove oxides to make it

---------30:20----------
easier to solder I'm not gonna get into

---------30:21----------
the science of it because I'll sound

---------30:22----------
like an idiot I don't really understand

---------30:24----------
the science of it

---------30:25----------
flux helps solder flow and removes

---------30:27----------
 that keeps me from making money

---------30:28----------
that's really like that's the extent to

---------30:31----------
which I understand what this tube does

---------30:32----------
and that's really to be honest with you

---------30:34----------
the extent to which you need to

---------30:35----------
understand what this tube does if you're

---------30:36----------
watching this channel for the purposes

---------30:38----------
of repairing broken ship so we do that

---------30:41----------
and it works now here's another thing

---------30:45----------
that I want to point out to you because

---------30:47----------
it's something that a lot of people are

---------30:48----------
gonna get wrong a lot of people

---------30:49----------
particularly people who are coming from

---------30:51----------
cellphone base troubleshooting not gonna

---------30:54----------
pick out any names here but I get a lot

---------30:55----------
of private messages about this stuff

---------30:57----------
when they're troubleshooting they they

---------30:58----------
don't think about things logically they

---------31:00----------
don't think about sequence they don't

---------31:01----------
think about what the order is or why

---------31:03----------
something should be happening they just

---------31:05----------
look for what looks up which is a

---------31:07----------
good way to start troubleshooting it's a

---------31:09----------
good way to learn and it's a good way to

---------31:11----------
get into doing this but if you're only

---------31:13----------
looking at what screwed up you're gonna

---------31:14----------
go down the wrong hole here and let me

---------31:16----------
show you why because when you look on

---------31:17----------
this board did you notice that the SMC

---------31:19----------
area looks good the SMC reset el area

---------31:22----------
look good the 1-wire area look good

---------31:24----------
it all looked beautiful perfect

---------31:26----------
immaculate you know it did not look good

---------31:28----------
is this area all the way on the other

---------31:29----------
side of the board over here this over

---------31:31----------
here is a logic gate that is responsible

---------31:33----------
for a PCH power okay signal coming on

---------31:36----------
for to turn on has nothing to do with

---------31:37----------
the green light and this is just random

---------31:39----------
corrosion around it this chip over here

---------31:41----------
I believe it's you 1950 it's the one

---------31:44----------
response it's the the one has all system

---------31:46----------
power good as an input and p.m. PCH

---------31:48----------
power okay as an output this one very

---------31:50----------
often goes bad on retinas and arrows

---------31:51----------
mostly on retinas just because of its

---------31:53----------
location in relation to the fan the

---------31:55----------
location of the chip in relation to the

---------31:57----------
fan has a lot to do with what [ __ ] up

---------31:59----------
so what do I mean by that then with a

---------32:00----------
fan in this computer is spinning its

---------32:02----------
spinning so I drop water into it and it

---------32:04----------
goes Bing which is right where that chip

---------32:08----------
was located ow

---------32:10----------
seriously I just managed yeah thank you

---------32:12----------
I have to stretch more often you get the

---------32:15----------
idea so on all these machines the

---------32:17----------
usually where the the water is going to

---------32:19----------
go to the same spot every time just

---------32:21----------
based on how that particular machine is

---------32:23----------
designed

---------32:24----------
and what's common so here it very

---------32:26----------
commonly goes to this section so yeah

---------32:29----------
that has nothing to do with what was

---------32:30----------
wrong absolutely nothing to do

---------32:33----------
am I gonna ultrasonic this yes am I

---------32:34----------
gonna make sure the underneath of that

---------32:36----------
chip looks good and that it works before

---------32:38----------
I send this back to the customer yes I'm

---------32:40----------
not gonna leave it like this but my

---------32:41----------
point is that this was not the problem

---------32:44----------
if you were following a mindset of just

---------32:46----------
let me see what looks up and

---------32:48----------
let's not think about anything else

---------32:49----------
you'd never figure out what's wrong with

---------32:51----------
this now I'm not saying it's bad I'm not

---------32:53----------
saying it's bad to just look look and

---------32:55----------
say that looks burned let me fix them

---------32:56----------
and replace that but I get so many

---------32:58----------
messages every single day saying hi I

---------33:01----------
want to replace this thing because it

---------33:03----------
has a green stuff on it and the thing

---------33:05----------
that has a green stuff on is a component

---------33:07----------
that is literally rated so like six or

---------33:09----------
eight or ten amps at 50 volts and it's

---------33:12----------
being used in a laptop it doesn't again

---------33:15----------
I you you could pour radioactive on

---------33:17----------
that it's not going to break what about

---------33:19----------
the thing in front of it what about the

---------33:20----------
thing behind it that's only rated for

---------33:22----------
you know one sixteenth of a watt but

---------33:25----------
that doesn't have the corrosion on it so

---------33:27----------
no but he looks at it I'm not saying

---------33:28----------
this to insult you I'm saying it because

---------33:30----------
I want to beat a logic into the head of

---------33:32----------
the people who watch this stuff because

---------33:34----------
there was a long period of time or I did

---------33:36----------
not use basic logic and I want you to

---------33:38----------
skip ahead of the stupid parts of my own

---------33:40----------
life that being said let's move on to

---------33:42----------
the next board and thank you for

---------33:43----------
watching
