---------00:00----------
hi so I haven't done a lot of board

---------00:01----------
repair video in a while you may have

---------00:02----------
noticed that I've been going through all

---------00:04----------
of my older edited videos and I will not

---------00:07----------
edit videos but I've been going through

---------00:08----------
my old recordings and editing them

---------00:10----------
rather than doing some new recordings so

---------00:11----------
I haven't done a live board repair video

---------00:14----------
in a while but we're gonna get to one

---------00:15----------
with this board right here we're gonna

---------00:17----------
try to figure out what's going on with

---------00:18----------
it

---------00:18----------
and I'm gonna explain it to you as with

---------00:20----------
all these board repairs live on camera

---------00:23----------
so this is a 15 inch retina from about

---------00:26----------
2013 2014 and the issue with it when we

---------00:29----------
go to plug it in is that you get a light

---------00:32----------
on the charger but it doesn't turn on so

---------00:36----------
we're gonna go over fixing it so that it

---------00:38----------
does turn on so what I always say is

---------00:40----------
that you should take a quick look over

---------00:41----------
the board before you turn your brain on

---------00:42----------
this is a concept that I think I've been

---------00:44----------
explaining to a lot of the students that

---------00:45----------
come for the tutoring but it's something

---------00:46----------
that I don't think I've been getting

---------00:47----------
across properly to the people who

---------00:50----------
actually watch the channel so I'd like

---------00:52----------
to do something we're called brain on

---------00:54----------
brain off so one of the ways that I deal

---------00:56----------
with the way my business works so as

---------00:58----------
I've explained in some of the prior

---------01:00----------
videos I'm the only person here doing

---------01:01----------
all the board repairs my years of

---------01:03----------
attempts at finding somebody qualified

---------01:05----------
have all usually failed with either

---------01:08----------
people lying about their experience or

---------01:10----------
coming for training and then within a 1

---------01:13----------
of 6 weeks running away screaming at the

---------01:16----------
horror the horror of doing my job of

---------01:20----------
working for me anyway

---------01:21----------
so I do all the work here in the way

---------01:23----------
that I'm able to get all of that done in

---------01:25----------
the way that I'm able to not burn myself

---------01:26----------
out is I go back and forth between brain

---------01:29----------
on and brain off so in order to not get

---------01:32----------
tired I try to spend as much time as I

---------01:34----------
can on what I call the brain off mode

---------01:35----------
where I don't have a schematic open I'm

---------01:38----------
not thinking about which pawel rail

---------01:40----------
comes first or what the sequence of

---------01:42----------
signals are or even just looking for

---------01:44----------
things on a schematic I really try to

---------01:45----------
limit using my brain until I absolutely

---------01:47----------
need to so I do a lot of work in this

---------01:49----------
mode called brain off where I'm not

---------01:52----------
necessarily thinking as I'm going

---------01:54----------
through what it is that I need to do so

---------01:56----------
let's go through that with this board so

---------01:58----------
the first thing that I do is I look over

---------02:00----------
the board to see if there's a spill

---------02:01----------
because even though most people come in

---------02:03----------
saying I've never spilled something this

---------02:04----------
is kind of thing where they think that

---------02:06----------
were the Apple store you see it's like

---------02:08----------
they people are kind of used to lying

---------02:10----------
because they think if they lie they'll

---------02:11----------
get something for free or that'll be

---------02:13----------
it's just kind of something that I think

---------02:15----------
is in grains and in people's heads and

---------02:16----------
they carry over into these situations

---------02:18----------
where there is where there's no chance

---------02:21----------
of warranty like I don't really care if

---------02:23----------
the issue with the machine was a liquid

---------02:24----------
spill or if the issue with the machine

---------02:27----------
is something else I'm you know I'm going

---------02:29----------
to charge you anyway but one of the most

---------02:32----------
common things are gonna here is that I

---------02:33----------
didn't spill anything no I didn't spill

---------02:35----------
anything this person was really adamant

---------02:36----------
that they had never spilled something on

---------02:38----------
their machine even though it smelled

---------02:41----------
smelled like Starbucks but they know so

---------02:45----------
the first thing I'm going to do is do

---------02:47----------
what dr. house says and not believe them

---------02:49----------
we're gonna look and see if as house

---------02:52----------
says if everybody lies so let's take a

---------02:55----------
look at this under the microscope and my

---------02:58----------
microscope looks funny

---------03:01----------
piece of so let's see are you gonna

---------03:04----------
look good when I plug you back in turn

---------03:05----------
you on yeah we get alright so let's

---------03:10----------
try unplugging that here we go this

---------03:12----------
looks a lot better I really have no

---------03:13----------
right to [ __ ] open broadcaster is free

---------03:15----------
and being free you know it's it's going

---------03:18----------
to it's it's gonna do some silly

---------03:21----------
sometimes let me just make sure that

---------03:22----------
it's in focus for me now I'm gonna make

---------03:25----------
sure that it's in focus for you and

---------03:27----------
we're gonna set it up and we're gonna go

---------03:28----------
through this board so you tell me if you

---------03:30----------
see anything that looks a little out of

---------03:31----------
the out of what you would usually

---------03:33----------
perceive as ordinary so we're gonna go

---------03:37----------
through

---------03:43----------
no-spill maybe he is maybe the person's

---------03:46----------
right maybe they're not lying after all

---------03:49----------
maybe I am just being an [ __ ]

---------03:54----------
customers don't lie man may never make

---------03:57----------
stuff up okay we're gonna go to the

---------04:00----------
other side of the board

---------04:14----------
what I feel like the noises that great a

---------04:18----------
Andrey makes can apply to so many things

---------04:20----------
in life and here I just see his little

---------04:24----------
stick figures going what do you mean

---------04:26----------
there's no water damage mate you

---------04:30----------
man

---------04:31----------
I would I would pay good money to watch

---------04:34----------
great i under a new board repair I

---------04:36----------
really would like I've never given

---------04:38----------
patreon money before but if grade a

---------04:41----------
under a we're willing to do

---------04:42----------
component-level motherboard repair and

---------04:44----------
deal with some of the stuff that I do

---------04:45----------
I would pay good money I would pay good

---------04:48----------
money to see yeah you know it's

---------04:53----------
interesting lately by the way for those

---------04:54----------
of you that keep asking what it is I'm

---------04:56----------
putting on there that's called flux if

---------04:58----------
you're new to the channel flux helps

---------05:00----------
solder flow this is the flux that I use

---------05:01----------
come on focus on me camera there we go

---------05:03----------
it's trying to focus on my face I

---------05:05----------
figure if I put my face right next to

---------05:07----------
the solder flux you'd be able to see it

---------05:09----------
there we go

---------05:10----------
so this helps solder flow and the thing

---------05:13----------
about this is it also is great for

---------05:16----------
cleaning so the whole idea behind this

---------05:17----------
is gonna clean any any of the junk

---------05:19----------
that's on the board that's going to keep

---------05:21----------
it from making a proper solder joint but

---------05:23----------
also what this is going to do it's also

---------05:25----------
gonna help me in cleaning away that dirt

---------05:26----------
so let's say I take this board and I put

---------05:28----------
it directly in the ultrasonic cleaner

---------05:29----------
let's say there's a little bit of that

---------05:30----------
solder joint that's just barely holding

---------05:33----------
on there's a little bit of junk left the

---------05:35----------
ultrasonic cleaner is gonna wash that

---------05:36----------
away but if I reflow it in a place first

---------05:39----------
then when I go to clean it I'm gonna

---------05:41----------
clean the corrosion off but I'm not

---------05:42----------
gonna up the solder joint so it's

---------05:44----------
just that that's why what I do now is I

---------05:46----------
is I do a bit of a cleaning with with

---------05:51----------
the flux and everything and at first I

---------05:53----------
try to fix the board first an ultrasonic

---------05:54----------
it at the end the reason we were doing

---------05:56----------
ultrasonic in first before was because I

---------05:59----------
had several people working here that did

---------06:00----------
not do board repair that would do

---------06:02----------
whatever they could to make it work

---------06:03----------
again before it got to me so in that

---------06:05----------
workflow with that workflow it made a

---------06:07----------
lot more sense in that scenario to have

---------06:10----------
made a lot more sense within that

---------06:14----------
scenario to have somebody ultrasonic at

---------06:17----------
first but since I'm the one who's both

---------06:18----------
disassembling the machine now and also

---------06:21----------
doing the border pair it makes a lot

---------06:22----------
more sense for me to just go through it

---------06:25----------
like this because I know it's gonna make

---------06:27----------
my life

---------06:27----------
again if it's ultrasonic first I'm not

---------06:30----------
gonna see that there's damage that I'm

---------06:31----------
gonna have to go through and measure

---------06:32----------
every single power rail which means

---------06:34----------
having brain on I don't want to keep my

---------06:36----------
brain on I want to be like you know I

---------06:38----------
want to be like the people that don't

---------06:39----------
use their brain and make money anyway so

---------06:41----------
that's what I'm doing here so just

---------06:49----------
heating away and now I can get a little

---------06:50----------
bit of a better view of what's going on

---------06:52----------
there

---------06:53----------
now remember brain off not gonna look up

---------06:56----------
at any of those things do brain is off

---------06:58----------
baby so I know what the original cause

---------07:02----------
of failure was because one of the things

---------07:04----------
that I got trolled on with that reddit

---------07:05----------
video is you don't if you don't know

---------07:07----------
what the cause is then how are you

---------07:08----------
actually gonna properly fix the problem

---------07:11----------
again for those of you that watch the

---------07:13----------
channel you guys know that I go through

---------07:15----------
and I look for what actually caused it

---------07:17----------
and I explained it in all my videos that

---------07:20----------
are actually longer that was the one

---------07:21----------
video that I did that was short and

---------07:23----------
that's why I don't do short videos in

---------07:24----------
this channel because I don't want to

---------07:26----------
cheat people out of information so

---------07:37----------
but in that video was probably it wasn't

---------07:40----------
liquid to the motherboard the

---------07:41----------
motherboard was in liquid damage but the

---------07:42----------
track that had a little bit of liquid on

---------07:43----------
it and that caused the board to

---------07:45----------
happen but here I already know what the

---------07:47----------
cause was so I know that the issue with

---------07:49----------
the board was something something

---------07:52----------
related to water so the first thing I'm

---------07:54----------
gonna try to do here is I'm gonna try to

---------07:56----------
bring back this see this pad over here

---------07:59----------
people would say that that pad is blown

---------08:02----------
Louis you got to get a pad repair kit

---------08:04----------
why aren't you fixing boards properly

---------08:05----------
with a pad repair kit why because I just

---------08:07----------
fixed it in five seconds BAM magic mofo

---------08:10----------
magic so if I had a guess I would say

---------08:14----------
the actually honestly I don't even know

---------08:16----------
what that is I'm guessing that one of

---------08:17----------
these up here or power is coming into

---------08:19----------
the IC I don't know what that that thing

---------08:22----------
is for you know what I'm not even gonna

---------08:23----------
look it up I'm genuinely not gonna look

---------08:25----------
it up because I don't care we're in

---------08:26----------
brain off mode here brain off mode is

---------08:30----------
great because you get to save because

---------08:34----------
the thing is if I can fix this without

---------08:35----------
using my brain and that means that I get

---------08:37----------
to save my brain for the ones that

---------08:38----------
matter and I've noticed I'm really at a

---------08:41----------
point where I have to save as much of my

---------08:42----------
brain power as I can cuz I'm not finding

---------08:50----------
a replacement to me anytime soon I've

---------08:52----------
been getting more serious over the past

---------08:53----------
month or two about finding a replacement

---------08:55----------
to myself can't do your job forever but

---------09:04----------
man it is hard it is a challenge as I

---------09:08----------
always say great

---------09:10----------
I stole the component I need from

---------09:12----------
this book I'm a thief

---------09:19----------
as I always say the people who can do

---------09:22----------
the type of work that I'm doing here are

---------09:25----------
the people that are employed at the

---------09:27----------
$200,000 or $150,000 a year jobs and the

---------09:31----------
people who will work for the salaries

---------09:33----------
that this business will support they

---------09:36----------
look at the screen they look at what I'm

---------09:39----------
doing and they nod and they nod and they

---------09:41----------
go oh yeah and then I put them in front

---------09:43----------
of something in I put them in front of

---------09:46----------
something in and it's over it's like

---------09:52----------
what and then I cry

---------10:15----------
now I'm not gonna get too crazy about

---------10:17----------
putting them on perfectly because as I

---------10:19----------
have to heat each one to solder it on

---------10:22----------
there I'm going to wind up reflowing the

---------10:24----------
one from right before so I'll be able to

---------10:27----------
flow it in a place just fine so when I

---------10:29----------
go to solder the last one that's when

---------10:31----------
I'm gonna go over all of them and flow

---------10:33----------
them in a place see all I really care

---------10:36----------
about now is getting them down on the

---------10:37----------
board in a manner where they where they

---------10:40----------
stick where they're supposed to

---------10:48----------
it's all about coming up with tactics

---------10:52----------
how can you deal with the things that

---------10:55----------
make you not great at your job makes me

---------10:57----------
not good at my job

---------10:58----------
my soldering is atrocious but doesn't

---------11:08----------
matter I'm gonna make this look

---------11:10----------
like Factory

---------11:18----------
backings it's how you get around your

---------11:25----------
flaws and imperfections that define you

---------11:27----------
it's not the floor the imperfection you

---------11:30----------
think I'm gonna let the fact that my

---------11:32----------
hands don't listen to my brain suck up

---------11:34----------
my ability to do my job

---------11:36----------
 you out of here I'm not gonna let

---------11:40----------
my brain win I'll even do it left-handed

---------11:44----------
if I have to and that bottom capacitor

---------11:50----------
could get flowing into place even though

---------11:54----------
it looks right right now I know that

---------11:56----------
it's sitting a little bit high on the

---------11:57----------
right side and you can't see that from

---------11:59----------
this angle in the microscope but you

---------12:02----------
might see it if I tap on it

---------12:13----------
actually it wasn't sitting high that's

---------12:15----------
just me being a freak with the OCD now

---------12:18----------
the middle resistor there on the right

---------12:20----------
side could look a little bit nicer just

---------12:24----------
wait for this thing to beep here this is

---------12:26----------
gonna beep in a second and we go here

---------12:29----------
and bam sexy as hell

---------12:52----------
and still no fan spin you mean I gotta

---------12:56----------
use my brain seriously that's

---------12:59----------
cruel oh well okay it was worth a shot

---------13:03----------
it was worth a shot it was worth it so

---------13:06----------
now I'm just gonna have to open the

---------13:07----------
board view and I'm gonna have to

---------13:08----------
actually think you ruined my day

---------13:11----------
motherboard you got my hopes up okay so

---------13:14----------
this is for the GPU frame buffer power

---------13:19----------
supply which I'm not really that

---------13:22----------
concerned with right now because it

---------13:23----------
doesn't turn on so now we're just gonna

---------13:25----------
go to some basic troubleshooting here

---------13:27----------
which is gonna be troubleshooting power

---------13:29----------
rails and we're going to try to figure

---------13:31----------
out why it doesn't turn on so any time

---------13:32----------
we have a no power issue what I do is I

---------13:34----------
go to the page that has all the power

---------13:36----------
rails listed and we're gonna go from

---------13:38----------
there so which page here is gonna have

---------13:41----------
my power rails listed come on you can do

---------13:46----------
it let's see is this an old enough

---------13:50----------
schematic that it's gonna be listed on

---------13:51----------
page seven this one of those schematics

---------13:57----------
R it's on page 70

---------14:07----------
that's a perfect page to put the power

---------14:10----------
rails let's put it on page 81 the first

---------14:12----------
thing that you gotta check on the

---------14:13----------
schematic Thank You Apple so the first

---------14:16----------
thing that we have to check here is PP

---------14:18----------
bus g3 hot so on this new board view

---------14:20----------
program if I want to find pp bus g3 hot

---------14:22----------
oh it's beautiful it's beautiful it's so

---------14:25----------
beautiful I love it now keep in mind I

---------14:28----------
know that I have pp 3 before - which is

---------14:30----------
the first rail you're supposed to check

---------14:32----------
I know that I have that because the

---------14:35----------
light is on the charger so I'm gonna do

---------14:38----------
now as I'm going to check for P bus g3

---------14:40----------
hot you can't see the multimeter because

---------14:42----------
of the camera angle oh well you'll just

---------14:43----------
have to yeah you can barely see it there

---------14:46----------
you go so let me do this I'll get a

---------14:51----------
video and I'll get a video employee by

---------14:54----------
the time you know yeah once I get

---------14:56----------
somebody to actually do this stuff point

---------14:59----------
eight volts 0.8 volts okay so now we've

---------15:04----------
checked the end of the circuit and we

---------15:05----------
have 0.8 volts instead of twelve point

---------15:07----------
six and now I'm gonna check for a short

---------15:08----------
to ground we turn the multimeter to ohms

---------15:10----------
then we go into diode mode and then I

---------15:12----------
pick my red probe put it on grounds and

---------15:14----------
my black probe and put it on PP bus g3

---------15:16----------
ha and what do you know we have a direct

---------15:18----------
short to ground so what are we gonna do

---------15:19----------
when we have a direct short to ground we

---------15:21----------
have a direct short to ground what I'm

---------15:22----------
gonna do is I'm going to run power into

---------15:24----------
the system and then see if after I run

---------15:26----------
power into the system using my bench

---------15:29----------
power supply if anything gets hot and

---------15:31----------
what gets hot and that's going to tell

---------15:34----------
me what's wrong so I'm gonna get my

---------15:35----------
bench power supply that's sitting behind

---------15:37----------
my HP 65-42 a I'm gonna solder this onto

---------15:40----------
the motherboard right now so I'm just

---------15:43----------
going to do this put a little bit of

---------15:48----------
solder on a screw hole this is the wrong

---------15:53----------
iron to be doing this with since this is

---------15:55----------
a micro pencil but

---------16:01----------
that's micro pencil is really not

---------16:05----------
feeling what I'm trying to do with it

---------16:07----------
micro pencil is not feeling this at all

---------16:11----------
why are you trying to solder a huge

---------16:13----------
ground plane with a little micro pencil

---------16:15----------
oh well

---------16:23----------
you're going to go whether you like it

---------16:25----------
or not I don't need a perfect joint for

---------16:32----------
this it's not like I'm gonna plan on

---------16:33----------
keeping it there then I'm going to

---------16:35----------
solder the nonce I'm gonna solder the

---------16:39----------
positive ends of the power supply onto

---------16:43----------
here now here's one of the things that

---------16:45----------
short detection on pp bus g3 hot is you

---------16:47----------
have to realize the pp bus g3 hot power

---------16:51----------
is the buck converter that makes power

---------16:52----------
for the CPU and GPU which work on

---------16:54----------
something approximately around one volt

---------16:56----------
so the reason that I'm going to start

---------16:57----------
short detection on this line with the

---------16:59----------
very low voltage is if one of the

---------17:00----------
MOSFETs providing the CPU with power is

---------17:02----------
blown if that's the case that if that's

---------17:06----------
what's going on here and I just run

---------17:08----------
power through the board at like five or

---------17:09----------
ten volts because of the 12 volt line

---------17:11----------
and the MOSFET is shorted that means

---------17:13----------
that the power from the MOSFET is going

---------17:16----------
to go directly to the CPU if these

---------17:18----------
MOSFET is shorted and then I send 12

---------17:20----------
volts to my CPU and my board is

---------17:22----------
and I don't want to do that alright so I

---------17:23----------
got the power supply on and got the

---------17:25----------
amperage set to a high amperage and

---------17:28----------
current is set to one volt and my wires

---------17:40----------
are not even plugged into my power

---------17:41----------
supply great ok so I've put a volt into

---------17:46----------
the board and now I'm gonna try to see

---------17:48----------
what gets hot now the first thing I

---------17:49----------
insure is that the CPU is not even

---------17:51----------
getting remotely warm or the GPU before

---------17:54----------
I up the voltage to do anything else

---------17:56----------
so CPU GPU PCH any of that stuff I want

---------17:59----------
to make sure any of the large chips are

---------18:01----------
not getting hot and once that's the case

---------18:08----------
then I can go a little higher

---------18:49----------
Loren's by a thermal camera Lewis by a

---------18:52----------
thermal camera Lewis by a thermal camera

---------18:55----------
also by a thermal camera when you're not

---------18:57----------
paying like $600 for the

---------19:00----------
resolution of a Game Boy I have just

---------19:03----------
something against getting ripped off I

---------19:04----------
don't have it in me to get ripped off oh

---------19:06----------
yeah fine cool

---------19:08----------
give me 1080p for like 400 bucks and

---------19:12----------
good quality and I'll buy it but again

---------19:14----------
every thermal camera that I've tried so

---------19:15----------
far has been just complete

---------19:17----------
 I mean just really like every

---------19:20----------
camera camera that I've tried it's just

---------19:23----------
always the same type of it's

---------19:26----------
some where it's like I see that the

---------19:30----------
board is this big and the yellow dot or

---------19:33----------
the orange dot is this big what good

---------19:36----------
does that do me you know absolutely

---------19:39----------
nothing it's just pointless like

---------19:44----------
I would buy it if it made the job easier

---------19:45----------
it's just man yeah I'm not against the

---------19:49----------
idea of a thermal camera I'm against the

---------19:51----------
idea of spending money on a thermal

---------19:53----------
camera when we're still at this points

---------19:55----------
where thermal cameras are just

---------19:56----------
anyway hmm now here's one thing I want

---------20:01----------
to point out - yeah do you see where

---------20:03----------
here's the thing we wouldn't even need a

---------20:05----------
thermal camera or your eyes would

---------20:06----------
suffice so see this so you just saw her

---------20:08----------
and it's kind of popped out you see what

---------20:09----------
this tells me this here tells me that

---------20:12----------
this had something go onto it even if I

---------20:15----------
wasn't actually running voltage through

---------20:16----------
this particular motherboard so I'm just

---------20:18----------
gonna stop the voltage right now and I'm

---------20:20----------
gonna see what that thing is for but I'm

---------20:21----------
pretty certain that that's our problem

---------20:23----------
so let's just turn on the board view

---------20:25----------
software ah you're seeing my desktop and

---------20:30----------
you're seeing you're seeing my drive and

---------20:33----------
the title of a video that I haven't

---------20:36----------
released the end yeah

---------20:37----------
oh noes and you see the IP address of a

---------20:42----------
backup server I'm going to get hacks or

---------20:45----------
did it hacks or did it hack sword hacks

---------20:53----------
H ax

---------20:55----------
so it's this little mofo

---------21:00----------
q 8760 q 8760 okay so this make this is

---------21:08----------
all coming into play now so the little

---------21:10----------
resistors that died with this one and

---------21:12----------
this stuff here which creates GPU frame

---------21:15----------
buffer now this creates GPU frame buffer

---------21:19----------
from using this MOSFET and if I had a

---------21:21----------
guess I would say that this MOSFET is

---------21:23----------
shorted at least the top section of it

---------21:26----------
at the bottom section because the

---------21:27----------
Geographics chip never actually got hot

---------21:29----------
so that means that maybe the bottom one

---------21:32----------
is short who the know something

---------21:34----------
over here is up and there's a

---------21:37----------
good chance the graphics chip is not

---------21:39----------
dead now this comes from this and this

---------21:43----------
comes from pp bus g3 yacht so this is

---------21:48----------
all making sense now alright this is all

---------21:50----------
making some good sense all right so now

---------21:56----------
here's the thing with buck converters if

---------21:58----------
this is shorted that means that it

---------21:59----------
probably sent 12 volts to this which

---------22:01----------
made this stay on which then caused this

---------22:04----------
to die and this then caused this to die

---------22:06----------
so the whole thing is I have to replace

---------22:08----------
these as a team if I replace this

---------22:10----------
without replacing this this will be dead

---------22:12----------
it will tell this to be on all the time

---------22:14----------
which will then cause this to send too

---------22:15----------
much power to this and they will just

---------22:17----------
die so if you look at my video on why

---------22:18----------
new B socket repairing the CPU v core

---------22:20----------
circuit this will all make sense in

---------22:22----------
context so the whole idea with the buck

---------22:24----------
converter is you have to replace post

---------22:25----------
look at the controller IC and the top

---------22:27----------
and the bottom MOSFET or else you're

---------22:29----------
just torturing yourself so let's go over

---------22:31----------
here and shove this off the board and

---------22:34----------
I'm pretty sure that my short circuit is

---------22:36----------
then going to go away let's just get my

---------22:40----------
air my fume extractor over here get it

---------22:42----------
nice and close

---------22:48----------
bonus if you don't burn the fan

---------22:50----------
connector not burning the fan connector

---------22:52----------
would be a bonus you get extra points

---------22:55----------
for that

---------23:05----------
[Music]

---------23:40----------
okay I'm not about to try and clear

---------23:47----------
MOSFET pads first GPU frame buffer with

---------23:50----------
a micro pencil iron so I'm gonna plug my

---------23:54----------
standard iron in there

---------24:08----------
get my wick in place here wick here

---------24:15----------
which here wikki wikki wikki wikki wikki

---------24:19----------
where are you wick

---------24:22----------
come here wick where'd you go

---------24:26----------
here we go new wick

---------24:32----------
gute wick

---------24:33----------
I think that's Chinese for good this is

---------24:37----------
all these little Chinese symbols on the

---------24:38----------
front of it but it's really good stuff

---------24:42----------
that's why I think G OoT is Chinese for

---------24:46----------
good it's good to know a little bit of

---------24:51----------
the language if you're buying from

---------24:53----------
vendors that sell things in another in

---------24:55----------
another language I'm never gonna forget

---------24:58----------
this is one vendor I don't buy from

---------24:59----------
anymore and I talked about that in a lot

---------25:04----------
another video and there's remember that

---------25:05----------
was unpack I'm packing boxes one time

---------25:07----------
this one guy back when we actually sold

---------25:09----------
parts came by to buy some stuff he looks

---------25:11----------
at the box and he's Chinese and you just

---------25:13----------
 laughing his ass off he finally

---------25:15----------
asked him like what the he was so

---------25:16----------
giddy about and he said the box

---------25:18----------
well you're opening a box that's labeled

---------25:20----------
 and I thought he was kidding and we

---------25:24----------
opened the box to use the parts and

---------25:26----------
although most of them didn't work so I'm

---------25:29----------
guessing that the guy was right he the

---------25:31----------
guy you know pretty much wrote on

---------25:33----------
the box in Chinese and actually sold us

---------25:36----------
that stuff just one of you one of the

---------25:38----------
things to think about all right so this

---------25:42----------
is not exactly the ideal tip to do this

---------25:44----------
you should use one of those bevel tips

---------25:46----------
if you're gonna do any type of wicking

---------25:47----------
the reason I'm using this is because my

---------25:50----------
beveled tip got destroyed so I have to

---------25:53----------
make do with what I have this is not the

---------25:54----------
ideal tip for what I'm doing but again

---------25:57----------
sometimes and you wanna you wanna you

---------26:01----------
wanna do you want to be the one to tell

---------26:02----------
the customer they gotta wait because a

---------26:03----------
tip got destroyed or do you just want to

---------26:05----------
make do with what you have you figure

---------26:07----------
out how to make do with what you have

---------26:09----------
right and you do your best if not touch

---------26:11----------
the capacitor that's to the right that's

---------26:14----------
what the you're the wick I was just

---------26:16----------
looking for before and you were sitting

---------26:17----------
on my desk this entire time mofo

---------26:21----------
all right so some light sinning

---------26:32----------
what a crowded space anytime you see

---------26:41----------
that Hershey's kiss thing you have to go

---------26:43----------
over your joint again I got a couple of

---------26:46----------
Hershey's kisses there is the angle here

---------26:50----------
is not great

---------26:59----------
it's naturally a angle angle

---------27:03----------
to work with how well it's it's

---------27:06----------
something that's gonna get bashed

---------27:07----------
directly onto the board anyway let's get

---------27:10----------
some flux get my alternate board pray

---------27:16----------
that I haven't stolen that piece yet

---------27:17----------
okay great I haven't stolen that piece

---------27:19----------
yet preheat the board a little bit clean

---------27:31----------
off my tweezer

---------27:37----------
yeah tweezer still has some junk on it

---------27:43----------
and be if you don't preheat the board

---------27:45----------
you can be heating the chip and burning

---------27:46----------
the chip but the board is going to be

---------27:47----------
absorbing the heat if the board is cold

---------27:49----------
you have to saturate the board was heat

---------27:51----------
and then when you go in to remove the

---------27:53----------
chip it's going to come off nice and

---------27:55----------
easy because the board the pads and the

---------27:58----------
board are not cold but if the pads on

---------28:00----------
the board are cold and you're kind of

---------28:03----------
 there we go comes off nicely yes

---------28:18----------
I am come and catch me repair police you

---------28:23----------
come and catch me you tube tech police

---------28:25----------
oh yeah I'm doing it Louis I can't

---------28:33----------
believe you don't have every single

---------28:35----------
component for every single motherboard

---------28:36----------
made in the past ten years immediately

---------28:38----------
in stock as a small business how dare

---------28:41----------
you how dare I indeed

---------28:48----------
oh dare I indeed okay there we

---------28:54----------
go it's in a place I move it around a

---------28:55----------
little bit but it's not flat in the

---------28:57----------
board so then once it dries I press on

---------29:00----------
the top now I know I'm not gonna move it

---------29:02----------
around but it's flat in place and I push

---------29:04----------
down and all the excess solder that's on

---------29:06----------
the pad is gonna magically go away a

---------29:08----------
little solder ball that flew away is not

---------29:10----------
getting past me and catching you mofo I

---------29:13----------
can have runaway solder balls inside of

---------29:16----------
my machine and we're just gonna pick up

---------29:19----------
all the stuff that came out the side so

---------29:21----------
it looks nice and clean and pretty and

---------29:22----------
sexy

---------29:23----------
not like that iMac video I uploaded so

---------29:28----------
you know runaway solder balls no runaway

---------29:31----------
solder balls this is such a angle

---------29:36----------
to work with

---------29:42----------
all right is what it is and we go under

---------29:48----------
the bottom of machine we're gonna

---------29:49----------
replace that buck controller I see even

---------29:51----------
if it managed to be good right now it

---------29:53----------
may not be good into the future I don't

---------29:54----------
trust it because I know that a FET in

---------29:56----------
front of it shorted and it was so

---------29:59----------
there's no need if you want a customer

---------30:02----------
to come back immediately the best thing

---------30:03----------
that you can do is half fix their

---------30:05----------
machine Louis I don't want to watch

---------30:10----------
these long videos I don't want to lapse

---------30:11----------
long videos videos and then I release a

---------30:14----------
video that's seven minutes long and then

---------30:16----------
it's all Lewis where's the primary fault

---------30:18----------
they Louis what is the primary fall they

---------30:20----------
Louis you didn't explain everything yeah

---------30:22----------
one thing I realized is you should never

---------30:25----------
try to make people on YouTube happy if

---------30:28----------
you're making youtube videos I would

---------30:31----------
suggest that you make them for yourself

---------30:32----------
and if people enjoy them that's great

---------30:35----------
and if they don't then they don't but if

---------30:37----------
you try to make view Tube videos for

---------30:39----------
other people it's never gonna work

---------30:40----------
you're never gonna make other people

---------30:41----------
happy just make stuff that you that you

---------30:46----------
if you think is cool content and if

---------30:48----------
others don't like it at the very least

---------30:50----------
you can live with the fact that you were

---------30:51----------
true to yourself I will most likely

---------30:58----------
never be a person that does three minute

---------31:00----------
videos just three to five minutes it's

---------31:02----------
not not happening it's not me if you're

---------31:07----------
looking for those videos then let me

---------31:09----------
just tell you now that you're definitely

---------31:12----------
on the wrong Channel

---------31:17----------
I just wouldn't want anybody to waste

---------31:20----------
time on the wrong channel if they don't

---------31:22----------
have to righty

---------31:44----------
that is sexy bunch of pads right there

---------31:48----------
[Music]

---------31:50----------
notice I'm not going nuts to make sure

---------31:52----------
every single one is the same size I just

---------31:54----------
want to make sure there's a decent sized

---------31:55----------
bump I know all of them you know we're

---------32:00----------
going to remove that from the donor

---------32:01----------
board

---------32:12----------
it should be hot enough to come off come

---------32:15----------
on

---------32:16----------
tweezer really is a good wheeze here we

---------32:20----------
go BAM

---------32:25----------
I gotta place this

---------32:32----------
go mother go mofo okay you go to place

---------32:37----------
the guy see heat you know there's no

---------32:42----------
rush I see a lot of people I try to

---------32:44----------
train they're like ah they run on the

---------32:46----------
chip as fast as they can no rush mo no

---------32:47----------
rush man

---------32:48----------
no rush we heat from far away and you

---------32:52----------
see all the flux light but you see all

---------32:53----------
the excess there's a reason for that

---------32:54----------
we're gonna wait for it to flow away and

---------32:57----------
once that excess flows away and you can

---------33:00----------
only see a little ripple amount around

---------33:01----------
every side of the chip I'll show you

---------33:03----------
what I mean by that in a second we're

---------33:05----------
gonna heat it in heated and so you only

---------33:06----------
see this tiny little amount for about

---------33:08----------
one or two millimeters outside the chip

---------33:10----------
so once you can see the puddle of flux

---------33:12----------
is isolated to one or two millimeters

---------33:13----------
outside the chip then that's when I go

---------33:15----------
in close and bam it flows right into

---------33:17----------
place see that now they go far away

---------33:20----------
again I push down on the chip once it's

---------33:23----------
at once the surface tension has put it

---------33:25----------
into place I heat it again I push it

---------33:28----------
down so that it's flat on the board and

---------33:30----------
making a good connection now I'm done

---------33:33----------
and I left a little mark on the outside

---------33:36----------
of the chip but that's totally fine it's

---------33:39----------
probably gonna piss off a couple of

---------33:40----------
engineers but oh well it's part of my

---------33:43----------
fun on this channel you have to piss off

---------33:46----------
engineers will just

---------33:51----------
go over the joins

---------33:58----------
[Music]

---------34:06----------
oh the hands required to do this job I

---------34:10----------
can't wait to find a replacement for

---------34:12----------
myself I'm giddy we'll see how that goes

---------34:17----------
though alright so let's see is my short

---------34:19----------
gone if I inject voltage let's put this

---------34:23----------
power supply at 0.8 volts and I see that

---------34:27----------
it's zero amps are being used so I'm

---------34:30----------
gonna plug this in and let's see if I

---------34:35----------
get a fan to spin

---------34:37----------
[Music]

---------34:46----------
okay I get a light and I get a fan spin

---------34:52----------
you know what just because just because

---------34:54----------
it's a really small chance that 12 volts

---------34:57----------
went to my GPU I'm gonna make sure that

---------35:00----------
it actually gives you a picture on the

---------35:02----------
screen before I get all excited I'm

---------35:06----------
gonna disconnect the power supply

---------35:07----------
[Music]

---------35:13----------
[Music]

---------35:17----------
disconnect the power supply from the

---------35:19----------
board and let's see if I get a picture

---------35:29----------
on the screen again just one of those

---------35:30----------
things when there's a 50-50 chance a 50

---------35:33----------
percent chance that 12 volts went to the

---------35:35----------
GPU we always test these things but I

---------35:37----------
want to actually just show you on camera

---------35:38----------
because I know there are some people

---------35:40----------
that are gonna go great a under a there

---------35:43----------
are people who are gonna give me the

---------35:44----------
grade a under a what you didn't even

---------35:50----------
check that and you call this a finished

---------35:52----------
repair video take off the air filter

---------36:01----------
what what okay so we're just gonna plug

---------36:06----------
in the bare minimum here so I'm gonna

---------36:07----------
plug in a DC n board I'm going to plug

---------36:11----------
in a screen and I'm going to see if the

---------36:14----------
screen shows me any sign that this thing

---------36:16----------
actually works and if it does then I can

---------36:19----------
clean the flux off reassemble run ASD

---------36:24----------
test in my OS and all that other boring

---------36:27----------
 that gets done off camera because

---------36:29----------
that's just it's frankly just boring you

---------36:32----------
you want to see me sit here and

---------36:33----------
reassemble stuff run ASD that's a that's

---------36:36----------
a yawn fest right there that's a total

---------36:40----------
yawn fest so I'm gonna do this plug my

---------36:44----------
DC n board and make sure nothing metal

---------36:47----------
is touching where it should end get you

---------36:51----------
in there okay okay it turns off okay I

---------37:03----------
get a light on the screen and oh well 12

---------37:13----------
volts to the GPU that's exactly what

---------37:15----------
happened to this thing so I was running

---------37:18----------
something like one volt with my power

---------37:20----------
supply to see what God ha but it doesn't

---------37:23----------
matter because when that FET did what

---------37:25----------
that FET did it sent 12 volts to the GPU

---------37:29----------
frame buffer and

---------37:30----------
so the vram so knowing that all the GPUs

---------37:36----------
I can buy for this board are 50 to $60

---------37:38----------
in coming from vendors in China that and

---------37:42----------
here's the thing with this like you

---------37:42----------
think most people like Louis well just

---------37:45----------
buy a GPU if I could buy the GPU from

---------37:48----------
Nvidia I buy it but I'm not I'm gonna

---------37:51----------
buy a GPU from some dude that's either

---------37:53----------
ripping it off a dead board or taking it

---------37:54----------
from a spool and here's the thing with

---------37:56----------
that spool here's what I want you to

---------37:58----------
understand is that the spool is where

---------38:00----------
did he get that spool from I spilled my

---------38:03----------
 drink on my shirt I just noticed

---------38:04----------
in the camera this is why I can't wear

---------38:07----------
white shirts I can't be trusted with

---------38:08----------
anything normal I wind up spilling crap

---------38:10----------
all over myself the thing is with this

---------38:14----------
is if I could buy that from Nvidia I

---------38:16----------
would be happy to take the time to

---------38:18----------
solder a new one on because it's about a

---------38:19----------
40 or 50 minute job and I am no fix no

---------38:21----------
pay but wait if Nvidia and AMD do not

---------38:24----------
sell those chipsets the people where do

---------38:26----------
you think that crap comes from it comes

---------38:27----------
from the back of a truck

---------38:28----------
somebody sells the rejects are the ones

---------38:30----------
that were bindas junk so you know have

---------38:32----------
you ever heard of this whole idea of

---------38:33----------
processor binning the whole idea being

---------38:35----------
that you know there's no such thing as a

---------38:37----------
3.3 or 3.5 and a 4 gigahertz processor

---------38:40----------
they try to make a bunch of 4 gigahertz

---------38:43----------
processors and the ones that fail at 4

---------38:45----------
gigahertz they test them again at 3.5 or

---------38:47----------
3.3 and if they pass that then they get

---------38:49----------
released that way what happens is I'm um

---------38:51----------
here's my guess is that a lot of the

---------38:53----------
processors or the graphics chips that

---------38:55----------
won't even work at the normal speeds in

---------38:57----------
some way shape or form of the one that

---------38:59----------
for some reason failed they're binning

---------39:01----------
tests are the ones that get sold and the

---------39:03----------
reason is because I've done enough of

---------39:05----------
them to know they just don't last as

---------39:07----------
long as the original one and a lot of

---------39:09----------
the times they just don't work at all

---------39:10----------
and I was thinking about this and it's

---------39:12----------
like well if they don't sell their good

---------39:13----------
chips to people if nobody can buy them

---------39:15----------
then how are these people getting ah

---------39:16----------
they're buying from the garbage it's

---------39:18----------
just one of those things that would be

---------39:19----------
really cool if it could change in our

---------39:21----------
business but it's not something that I

---------39:22----------
think is gonna change anytime soon but

---------39:25----------
again as this channel gets more popular

---------39:26----------
and as I get to talk about these issues

---------39:28----------
with more and more people and as it gets

---------39:30----------
a bigger audience what I'm hoping

---------39:31----------
happens I'm hoping that enough people

---------39:33----------
realize this stuff but again it is kind

---------39:36----------
of a waste that somebody like me doesn't

---------39:38----------
see it worth the time and replace that

---------39:40----------
chip because all the places I can buy it

---------39:41----------
from our places that will

---------39:44----------
there are places that will probably sell

---------39:48----------
me again good chance I get a

---------39:50----------
chip that works for a little good chance

---------39:52----------
I get a chip that doesn't work at all

---------39:53----------
very low chance that I get a chip that

---------39:55----------
was from the same pile as the one is

---------39:58----------
same bin binning as the one that was

---------40:01----------
originally put on the board so this is

---------40:03----------
where I will call this board repair

---------40:04----------
ended and again the whole thing with the

---------40:06----------
no fix No Fee model the whole thing with

---------40:08----------
the no fix No Fee model I get a lot of

---------40:11----------
easy ones but you know I spent a half

---------40:14----------
hour on this one and I ain't getting

---------40:16----------
paid for it so not much that I can do

---------40:19----------
there not much that I can do at all

---------40:22----------
actually so that's it for today and as

---------40:25----------
always I hope you learned something and

---------40:28----------
support the rights or repair bill so

---------40:30----------
that people like me can buy these

---------40:31----------
chipsets that would be so cool

---------40:33----------
that's it
