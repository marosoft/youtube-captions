---------00:08----------
my helmets kind of turned my hair into

---------00:09----------
what looks like a toupee yeah I'd rather

---------00:14----------
wear a helmet than not wear a helmet and

---------00:15----------
be dead because here at Rossmann repair

---------00:18----------
we value safety in an OSHA compliant

---------00:22----------
workplace what are you standing on hi hi

---------00:27----------
what the [ __ ] are you standing on hi hi

---------00:30----------
is that a folding chair we have a ladder

---------00:33----------
right there next to Steve's desk an

---------00:36----------
actual ladder and you're standing on a

---------00:38----------
[ __ ] folding chair alright so today

---------00:43----------
we're gonna be working on a MacBook Air

---------00:45----------
no power a 1466 an easy job now Paul of

---------00:50----------
course is going to get mad as he often

---------00:52----------
does when he sees that I'm working on

---------00:54----------
something that's seemingly easy

---------00:55----------
while his queue is miserable [ __ ] so

---------00:58----------
I decided to do something that I'm gonna

---------00:59----------
let you all decide if you think it's

---------01:00----------
fair the other day I gave Paul one of

---------01:02----------
the easiest things there was an iPad

---------01:04----------
that needed a single filter replaced and

---------01:06----------
what did he do for two months he avoided

---------01:09----------
it so now what that tells me is that

---------01:11----------
what Paul actually wants is all the

---------01:13----------
difficult stuff this stuff what you have

---------01:15----------
to burn your brain the PM sleep s for

---------01:17----------
ELLs the short runs of the PC H because

---------01:19----------
when I give Paul a job that needs this

---------01:21----------
one filter replacement he says I don't

---------01:24----------
want that keep that away from me it's

---------01:26----------
scary so we're gonna open up this

---------01:29----------
MacBook with no power and see what's

---------01:31----------
going on with it let's just get this

---------01:32----------
thing on the desk that didn't just troll

---------01:34----------
Paul that trolled Camille they trolled

---------01:35----------
Davidson admittedly it trolled me

---------01:37----------
because I was avoiding looking at it

---------01:39----------
because I figured if everybody here

---------01:40----------
couldn't figure this out this is gonna

---------01:41----------
be a crack in the motherboard or short

---------01:43----------
on to the the a 10 or a 11 or whatever

---------01:46----------
the hell processor chip is on there it's

---------01:49----------
gonna be a nightmare

---------01:53----------
but see the thing is with this door the

---------01:55----------
way it works is when somebody solves

---------01:57----------
something that everybody else thinks is

---------01:58----------
unsolvable but that had with that person

---------02:00----------
who solved it since they then proved

---------02:02----------
they could solve it then gets all of

---------02:03----------
them so what's going on wind up

---------02:05----------
happening is every single time somebody

---------02:06----------
sends an iPad pro and it's going to wind

---------02:09----------
up right over here so I've kind of

---------02:10----------
screwed myself since I set that

---------02:12----------
precedent every time a customer walks in

---------02:14----------
and says my iPad pro has a problem

---------02:16----------
Paul's gonna take it in and put it over

---------02:17----------
here tell them

---------02:18----------
one a two-day turnaround twist the knife

---------02:24----------
while you wait while you wait random

---------02:29----------
glitching touch repair well you get that

---------02:38----------
we will have figured out and fix your

---------02:40----------
digitizer at component level oh this is

---------02:44----------
a clean air no power

---------02:45----------
look at this clean air no power some

---------02:53----------
people like smelling roses I like

---------02:55----------
smelling clean there are no powers look

---------02:57----------
at that

---------02:58----------
never thought it on before no rice no

---------03:02----------
screws in the wrong places it's

---------03:06----------
beautiful all right let's get the board

---------03:08----------
out of this thing and see what we can do

---------03:10----------
dizzy Moses demolition clauses are

---------03:12----------
common there are even relocation clauses

---------03:13----------
and clauses and purchase buildings in

---------03:15----------
titling previous owner to any profits

---------03:18----------
made from future development or sale

---------03:19----------
listen so if you're gonna have a

---------03:22----------
demolition clause within the building

---------03:23----------
that says oh yeah I know you have you

---------03:24----------
signed a 10-year lease we could just end

---------03:26----------
it at any time a nephew you have to pay

---------03:28----------
me you're gonna have to pay me because

---------03:30----------
it costs money to relocate it's going to

---------03:33----------
cost money to rebuild everything it's

---------03:34----------
going to cost ever all of this is

---------03:36----------
actually going to cost money

---------03:38----------
and this is you know it's business it's

---------03:44----------
you're gonna be making money off of me

---------03:46----------
while I'm there you can't have it both

---------03:48----------
ways you just you can't have it both

---------03:50----------
ways you can't collect rent from a

---------03:51----------
tenant that gives you rent every month

---------03:53----------
steadily and sell the building and then

---------03:56----------
keep all the money for yourself that's

---------03:57----------
just not the way this hat it's not the

---------03:59----------
way it's gonna go it's this is not gonna

---------04:00----------
happen nice no no it's just no

---------04:04----------
absolutely absolutely

---------04:06----------
no so that is a point that we are going

---------04:12----------
to have to negotiate back and forth

---------04:14----------
luckily I have an amazingly talented

---------04:16----------
broker who is going to help me with all

---------04:19----------
of this entire process

---------04:23----------
Paul is also gonna write me up a TPS

---------04:26----------
report estimating what it would cost to

---------04:27----------
move yes what type of cover letter to

---------04:40----------
use in your TPS a TPS report outlines

---------04:44----------
the cost for travel and procurement of a

---------04:47----------
space and I need Paul to write a TPS

---------04:51----------
report that I could send to my broker to

---------04:53----------
send to utilize for negotiating ok now

---------04:56----------
this board has actually been washed

---------04:57----------
before and here's the thing if you're

---------04:59----------
looking at it like this you can't really

---------05:00----------
tell but when you turn it a little bit

---------05:02----------
yeah look at that look at that that's

---------05:04----------
either flux or previous spill so I'm

---------05:07----------
just gonna plug this cable back in we're

---------05:09----------
gonna unplug the SSD because any sort of

---------05:11----------
heating work that I do I don't want to

---------05:13----------
affect the rest of this let's just do

---------05:16----------
this so right

---------05:26----------
also people just so you know in the next

---------05:29----------
ten days we are gonna have a million

---------05:30----------
subscribers and one of the things that

---------05:32----------
I'm planning on is having a 1 million

---------05:34----------
subscriber party I asked Hannah and

---------05:37----------
Camille here if they may have any idea

---------05:38----------
as to where it is we should throw this

---------05:40----------
but I'd like to actually invite every

---------05:42----------
subscriber so if you're part of the 1

---------05:44----------
million people who are subscribers or

---------05:47----------
970 something thousand just just know

---------05:49----------
that we have something in the works

---------05:51----------
because in the next 10 days we are gonna

---------05:53----------
have a million and I think would be

---------05:55----------
really cool if in the middle of

---------05:56----------
Manhattan we have some sort of

---------05:57----------
get-together

---------05:57----------
where literally anybody who is a

---------05:59----------
subscriber to the channel could come

---------06:01----------
meet again we are hitting that that 1

---------06:04----------
million figure soon we're going to have

---------06:06----------
all sorts of cool stuff and it's gonna

---------06:09----------
be awesome it's gonna be awesome the 1

---------06:12----------
million subscriber party I'd like to try

---------06:15----------
to schedule it right on the time that I

---------06:17----------
think that millions going to hit so

---------06:19----------
maybe you could be the day that the

---------06:20----------
million is gonna hit I'm gonna be

---------06:21----------
watching socialblade closely it's gonna

---------06:24----------
be yeah just let me know what you think

---------06:26----------
we're koware should I hold something

---------06:27----------
like this should it be in a park should

---------06:29----------
it be in a building should it be in a

---------06:31----------
club should it be in some office space

---------06:33----------
if one of you out there watching is a

---------06:36----------
venture capitalist multi-billionaire

---------06:37----------
maybe we could rent out Madison Square

---------06:39----------
Garden with it or the Javits Center for

---------06:41----------
a day hey your fashion and that would be

---------06:45----------
that would be kind of cool yep Hank said

---------06:53----------
on the subject of bargaining think of it

---------06:54----------
like dating yes she is pretty but you

---------06:56----------
both have your own wants it's all about

---------06:58----------
growing towards each other for a good

---------07:00----------
relationship one side it doesn't end

---------07:02----------
well I agree I'm not gonna ask for

---------07:04----------
something ridiculous like half a million

---------07:06----------
to a million dollars I think $150,000 is

---------07:08----------
really fair if I'm going to be leaving I

---------07:11----------
think you know hundred fifty thousand

---------07:12----------
you want to kick me out of the lease

---------07:13----------
that's fine I'm gonna have to build a

---------07:15----------
new place do all this stuff from scratch

---------07:16----------
it's a lot of work 150 K to relocate my

---------07:19----------
business is I think fair and you know I

---------07:22----------
know it can't be a one-sided thing

---------07:24----------
this can't be some one-sided BS like I'm

---------07:26----------
hitting a million subscribers while

---------07:27----------
somebody else is delivering mail

---------07:32----------
but anyway so we are going to let's just

---------07:36----------
take a look here and you will see that

---------07:40----------
we've got a lot of junk in that area so

---------07:43----------
let's see what all that stuff is gonna

---------07:47----------
be all right

---------07:53----------
so as can be seen here we have corrosion

---------07:56----------
around now you can see that as you can

---------08:02----------
see here we have corrosion on this

---------08:05----------
capacitor so see this is a healthy cap

---------08:08----------
over here on my left so as you could see

---------08:10----------
these are healthy capacitors over here

---------08:13----------
whereas this is all kind of corroded

---------08:17----------
away and it looks like somebody used

---------08:19----------
yeah that's flux yeah yeah yeah what did

---------08:23----------
you do I thought this was a clean

---------08:26----------
MacBook Air I said it was a beautiful

---------08:29----------
untouched nice happy little MacBook Air

---------08:31----------
and it's not hot what did they do to you

---------08:36----------
yeah we're gonna plug this in you're

---------08:38----------
gonna turn on my power supply get the

---------08:40----------
power supply on the screen how many amps

---------08:46----------
are you using so you go to 120 milli

---------08:49----------
amps and then you go back down to 30 so

---------08:51----------
let's go around this board and see

---------08:53----------
what's going on with it we're gonna turn

---------08:54----------
on my multimeter turn on paul daniels of

---------08:57----------
software i think two hundred thousand

---------08:59----------
dollars to the demo clothes would be

---------09:00----------
fair okay i'll take that into

---------09:02----------
consideration

---------09:03----------
you know steve was saying in the 250

---------09:05----------
area I thought maybe 150 but I think

---------09:08----------
200k is probably closer to the mark

---------09:09----------
we'll see you again maybe they'll balk

---------09:11----------
at it you know you never know me maybe

---------09:15----------
maybe it works maybe it doesn't so here

---------09:18----------
we have the list of power rows we're

---------09:20----------
just going to go down our list and see

---------09:21----------
what's present and what's not present

---------09:27----------
okay

---------09:35----------
8 point 5 volts @pp bunch g3 hot BAM we

---------09:40----------
have PP 3 or 4 2 since we got a light in

---------09:41----------
the charger PP 5 es 5 is down here 5

---------09:47----------
volts presents PP 5 es 4 is gonna be

---------09:50----------
around they're not presents but hmm PPV

---------09:56----------
RTC g3 hot hmm PPV RTC g3 huh oh there

---------10:02----------
we go yeah you're there

---------10:09----------
what am i doing you're not in the

---------10:11----------
microscope to go

---------10:15----------
all right so let's see what the [ __ ]

---------10:18----------
happened over here

---------10:19----------
what are these capacitors for why is

---------10:20----------
this [ __ ] all scraped I'm gonna guess

---------10:24----------
that my issue is gonna be something in

---------10:26----------
this area over here if I unplug the

---------10:32----------
charger and I plug it in no bump all

---------10:37----------
right so I'm just going to assume that

---------10:38----------
something stupid happened in this area

---------10:40----------
and we're going to replace what we see

---------10:42----------
in this this arena by the way you can

---------10:45----------
see there's also green corrosion in that

---------10:47----------
area as well see this see that where

---------10:52----------
would you hold the 1 million subscriber

---------10:53----------
bash Catherine how about a sliding scale

---------10:57----------
is something crazy like 250 to 300 K for

---------10:59----------
the first year and more like 150 after

---------11:02----------
five years I don't know that could

---------11:04----------
actually be worse because that's the

---------11:05----------
thing in five years from now what if the

---------11:06----------
business has grown a lot and there's way

---------11:09----------
more inconvenience to moving perhaps we

---------11:16----------
could do something like that but still

---------11:18----------
the thing is it's good like the cost of

---------11:20----------
construction and all that everything

---------11:22----------
goes up I mean five years you know

---------11:24----------
inflation will have gone up it's going

---------11:27----------
to cost me more money to get those

---------11:29----------
things done later on not less

---------11:42----------
1 million party in front of the Apple

---------11:44----------
store yeah but I don't want to stand in

---------11:47----------
front of an Apple store all day outside

---------11:48----------
like where am I gonna pee where like

---------11:50----------
what about food and all that kind of

---------11:51----------
stuff I want I want to be able to use a

---------11:54----------
restroom and I want to be able to eat

---------11:57----------
sit down talk to people is the New York

---------12:01----------
City public sidewalk really the best

---------12:03----------
place to celebrate 1 million subscribers

---------12:20----------
that's actually not a bad idea cars in

---------12:22----------
depth it's just yes that terrible idea

---------12:27----------
and so let's take a look at the pads

---------12:29----------
that are broken or the ones that are

---------12:30----------
really nasty on the schematic just to

---------12:32----------
give us an idea

---------12:33----------
so the pads that are the nastiest are

---------12:35----------
going to be this one over here this is

---------12:39----------
what go this is supposed to be a pad

---------12:42----------
that goes to this resistor boot and pp5

---------12:45----------
es 4 so PP 5 es for one of the things

---------12:47----------
I'm going to be interested in doing

---------12:48----------
since that's a really corroded pad for

---------12:50----------
the 5 volt power line is see if it's

---------12:53----------
short it to ground so I'm going to just

---------12:58----------
check and see if that line is shorted to

---------12:59----------
ground right now

---------13:01----------
and it's not 3 kilo ohms and next thing

---------13:05----------
I want to do is see where this this boot

---------13:09----------
thing goes do the schematic just got

---------13:13----------
around a fix my Nintendo Entertainment

---------13:14----------
System cost about five dollars for new

---------13:16----------
seventies you've been connected thanks

---------13:17----------
for the inspiration to fix it that's

---------13:19----------
awesome you fixed the suit you fixed it

---------13:20----------
nes i want to well i would love to play

---------13:23----------
the original mario on that sometime let

---------13:25----------
me play that in like 15 years am i

---------13:28----------
getting about 15 to 25 years yeah so

---------13:30----------
this was probably totally burned out so

---------13:32----------
it's good chance the chip was still good

---------13:34----------
but just the capacitor and resistor

---------13:35----------
going there was burned out either way if

---------13:38----------
that if that was that burned and that

---------13:41----------
cap goes to this resistor I'm not going

---------13:43----------
to rely on this resistor anymore

---------13:45----------
you never know it's got to go

---------14:00----------
yeah so any of you have suggestions as

---------14:03----------
to where to hold this in Manhattan

---------14:04----------
please do email me Louis at Rosslyn

---------14:07----------
group comm there's no time to waste

---------14:14----------
we got about let's see if we're gaining

---------14:17----------
subscribers at 2,000 rate of 2,000 a day

---------14:20----------
and I need 25,000 that's 12 days 12 days

---------14:25----------
to plan this party

---------14:44----------
yeah that pad done for Oh

---------15:10----------
okay I'm gonna have to run a wire from

---------15:13----------
that capital from there to there rent

---------15:18----------
the filthy restaurant for a day that

---------15:22----------
would be a great place let Alan find the

---------15:27----------
place for a subscriber party you know

---------15:32----------
what I'll actually LSE email him that

---------15:45----------
I'm fighting with the boards inside the

---------15:47----------
slot

---------16:38----------
why'd you say you were surprised more

---------16:39----------
people watching real estate videos and

---------16:41----------
technical videos I mean because the real

---------16:48----------
estate videos is just me walking around

---------16:50----------
and talking about [ __ ]

---------16:51----------
whereas the other ones are actual videos

---------16:53----------
that provide value to society so the

---------16:56----------
reason that I was surprised that more

---------16:57----------
people are interested in watching the

---------16:58----------
real estate stuff than this is if you

---------17:00----------
watch the repair let's say if you're a

---------17:02----------
repair shop or you you know or you're

---------17:04----------
somebody who has access to any sort of

---------17:06----------
you know recycled equipment just stuff

---------17:09----------
like this you could use the video you

---------17:11----------
know no like I'm not trying to sound you

---------17:13----------
go I think I have a large ego at this

---------17:15----------
but you could take the videos that I put

---------17:17----------
out and you can use them to make a

---------17:18----------
pretty good some money well you could

---------17:21----------
increase your shops business you know by

---------17:24----------
five or six figures a year if you add

---------17:26----------
this stuff to your repertoire whereas

---------17:29----------
the me just saying oh look here's an

---------17:32----------
annoying broker here's somebody that's

---------17:34----------
lying about stuff here's somebody that

---------17:37----------
here's an annoying old lady that is

---------17:42----------
condescending aggravating phony and just

---------17:45----------
annoying in every way ever liked that

---------17:47----------
that more people are interested in one

---------17:49----------
that then people are interested in

---------17:51----------
watching something that can actually add

---------17:55----------
value to society by taking stuff that's

---------17:58----------
waste and making it work again and again

---------18:01----------
it's not just the meat taking stuff

---------18:03----------
that's dead and making it work again for

---------18:05----------
the ethics it's taking stuff that's

---------18:06----------
broken and making it work again to you

---------18:08----------
know pay pay your bills I'm just

---------18:11----------
surprised that more people are

---------18:12----------
interested and in the

---------18:18----------
you know the gossipy stuff than they are

---------18:22----------
in the stuff of substance

---------18:23----------
perhaps I should not be surprised by

---------18:25----------
that though

---------18:38----------
are you well again I'm better tomorrow

---------18:40----------
I'm getting back to the Wing Chun

---------18:41----------
training I suck but I'm just kind of

---------18:45----------
trying to challenge myself to learn

---------18:46----------
something new there and I wasn't able to

---------18:49----------
do it while I was sick

---------19:08----------
I smell coconut bathroom spray do you

---------19:13----------
smell coconut bathroom spray Paul I love

---------19:16----------
that toka nut bathroom spray everybody

---------19:19----------
say thank you it's a pink sauna in the

---------19:21----------
chat for providing us with lovely

---------19:22----------
coconut bathrooms right

---------19:31----------
you should start pricing the parts you

---------19:33----------
sell in the store per square inch now I

---------19:37----------
should just start saying that we sell 45

---------19:39----------
cc's of mtech flux instead of 30 what do

---------19:42----------
you think of that Paul we sell 90 cc's

---------19:45----------
of Amtech flux prove me wrong

---------19:49----------
would you be would you find that to be -

---------19:55----------
yeah perhaps

---------20:02----------
yeah reality it's not it's not a lie

---------20:08----------
it's commercial flux sells take the wire

---------20:23----------
do you live in reality Paul do you

---------20:28----------
measure things beef if you they're

---------20:31----------
purchasing based on measurements and the

---------20:33----------
price is based on measurements would you

---------20:37----------
accurately advertise 30% shrinkage when

---------20:40----------
using tinder

---------21:15----------
and okay let's see what we got here it's

---------21:18----------
beautiful

---------21:19----------
I'll get this beautiful beautiful board

---------21:22----------
mwah mwah

---------21:26----------
okay

---------21:31----------
and as you can see we're now getting

---------21:33----------
fans been so let's go over something

---------21:35----------
that I think is pretty interesting here

---------21:36----------
because this is something that honestly

---------21:39----------
I didn't even know off the top of my

---------21:40----------
head so what was going on with this

---------21:42----------
machine is we were missing all the rails

---------21:43----------
above the s5s so he had pp bus g3 hot

---------21:47----------
we had PPV RTC g3 hot we had PP 5 es 5

---------21:50----------
and I believe we had pp 3 v 3s 5 but we

---------21:53----------
were missing the s4 so when I checked PP

---------21:55----------
5 es 4 it was stuck at 0 now it wasn't

---------21:58----------
doing the thing where it pulses and goes

---------22:00----------
you know 5 volts on the knife levels on

---------22:02----------
the knob Fievel sounded off it was just

---------22:04----------
staying in a straight-up zero it pulsed

---------22:06----------
when it originally turned on for a quick

---------22:07----------
second but then stayed off throughout

---------22:09----------
the entire thing there are times where

---------22:11----------
you can actually see it pulsing

---------22:12----------
regularly where it's going to 5 volt 0-5

---------22:14----------
volt 0-5 volt zero the entire time

---------22:16----------
rather than just one set of 5 volts zero

---------22:17----------
so it was interesting here you have the

---------22:20----------
g3 hot rails on when them computers

---------22:22----------
always on just always on s5 when the

---------22:25----------
computer is off s4 rails that are gonna

---------22:28----------
be on the computers hibernating s3 rails

---------22:30----------
are gonna be on when the computer is

---------22:31----------
asleep or in suspend mode s o rails that

---------22:34----------
are gonna be on when the computer is

---------22:35----------
actively on and functioning like this

---------22:37----------
one is that streaming now you need to

---------22:39----------
have the rails below whichever one that

---------22:41----------
you're measuring so if in order to have

---------22:43----------
your s3 rails you have to have yours

---------22:45----------
four in order have your s4 you have to

---------22:47----------
have your S 5 and 1/2 x 5e f FG 3 hot

---------22:48----------
and so on and so forth now what's

---------22:51----------
interesting here is that I didn't have

---------22:54----------
as four rails because my ass out chip

---------22:56----------
was broken so what I kind of learned

---------22:57----------
here is that if P P 1 vo 5s o as a

---------23:00----------
problem there's an issue with P P 1 vo

---------23:02----------
5s o which is around this chip that I'm

---------23:05----------
showing you over here what I find really

---------23:08----------
interesting is that if you have an issue

---------23:09----------
with people with an S o rail it will

---------23:11----------
actually keep your s 4 rails from

---------23:13----------
working and it's something that yeah

---------23:14----------
just kind of interesting you know so the

---------23:17----------
S 4 rail is not going to turn on and

---------23:19----------
stay on even if there's no problem with

---------23:20----------
that s 4 rail if the s o rail is not

---------23:24----------
able to turn on so the machine tried to

---------23:25----------
turn on it probably got itself to an

---------23:26----------
Esso state realize this missing P P 1 vo

---------23:28----------
5 s o and instead of just shutting off

---------23:30----------
the SOS it just shut off all the s 3 s

---------23:33----------
and the S 4 s as well but left the s5 is

---------23:35----------
running very interesting so that's it

---------23:38----------
for this one we do have a fan spin we do

---------23:40----------
have a fan spin which um this isn't mean

---------23:43----------
this is as close to fix as you're ever

---------23:44----------
going to get so

---------23:45----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------23:48----------
you learned something

---------23:56----------
you

---------24:12----------
ah
