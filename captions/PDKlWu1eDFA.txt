---------00:00----------
so today we're going to be working on

---------00:01----------
another MacBook let's open up this

---------00:03----------
MacBook and see if it can be fixed this

---------00:05----------
is an a 1708 MacBook non touch bar USB

---------00:08----------
see model that is not turning on if

---------00:11----------
you're looking for some complete

---------00:12----------
disrespect

---------00:14----------
check out this screen here you can buy a

---------00:19----------
screen for an a 1150 or a 12-11 MacBook

---------00:21----------
Pro a perfect birthday present for a

---------00:24----------
friend or significant other we want to

---------00:26----------
fluorescently backlit screen that has a

---------00:27----------
property ID code so they're a eleven

---------00:29----------
fifty or a twelve eleven ATI Radeon X

---------00:31----------
1600 based MacBook can have a proper

---------00:33----------
screen again it'll be signed with a

---------00:36----------
loving message from Luis Rosberg may or

---------00:39----------
may not include lyrics to hit tools

---------00:41----------
message to Harry man back the first

---------00:43----------
thing we to do here is unplug the

---------00:44----------
battery because the battery is going to

---------00:47----------
take a different amount of amperage

---------00:49----------
depending on how charges which is going

---------00:51----------
to mess up my readings so the first

---------00:53----------
thing that I do when I'm diagnosing this

---------00:54----------
is I plug it in to the charger and then

---------00:57----------
with this little USB C amp meter and

---------00:59----------
this is going to tell me how much power

---------01:00----------
the board is taking but if the board is

---------01:02----------
also delivering power to the battery

---------01:03----------
then we're going to have two separate

---------01:05----------
variables that we're measuring at the

---------01:06----------
same time which means we're actually

---------01:07----------
measuring nothing I want to know how

---------01:09----------
much power the board is taking by itself

---------01:11----------
not the board plus the battery so this

---------01:14----------
board is able to make its way to 20

---------01:15----------
volts which means the cd32 15 ships are

---------01:18----------
communicating with a charger on these

---------01:20----------
machines the cd32 15 ships are the USBC

---------01:22----------
muxes they need to communicate with the

---------01:24----------
charger in order to tell the charger I'm

---------01:26----------
not a cell phone I'm a momma go pro I'm

---------01:28----------
a MacBook

---------01:29----------
I want 20 volts not 5 and that's clearly

---------01:33----------
being done but the zero amp draw means

---------01:35----------
that either our power rules are not

---------01:36----------
being told to come on or there is a dead

---------01:38----------
short circuit that's and one of the

---------01:40----------
chips is noticing that there's a dead

---------01:41----------
short circuit in deciding not to create

---------01:43----------
a new power for the machine the only way

---------01:45----------
to figure that out would be to take this

---------01:46----------
board out of the case and go from there

---------01:48----------
alright so the first thing we're gonna

---------01:49----------
check is our pp bus now PP 3v3

---------01:51----------
undersquare g3 Honda's the first rail we

---------01:53----------
need for this to work however we already

---------01:55----------
have that because we're getting 20 volts

---------01:57----------
in the charger in order get 20 volts in

---------01:58----------
the charger these two chips need to be

---------02:00----------
able to communicate with the charger and

---------02:01----------
these two chips are powered by PP 3 V 3

---------02:02----------
and R squared u 3 dots we have that so

---------02:04----------
the first row we're gonna check and see

---------02:05----------
if we have PP bus g3 huh cause that's

---------02:06----------
the rail that everything else going to

---------02:07----------
create it from and down here we take a

---------02:09----------
look and we see that we've got 0

---------02:11----------
and zero volts now we're gonna do is are

---------02:13----------
gonna see if we have a short to ground

---------02:14----------
on our pp bus point 5 ohms so now before

---------02:21----------
we go crazy trying to figure out you

---------02:24----------
know if there's a short that we can

---------02:27----------
detect on thermal camera I just want to

---------02:28----------
look at the board itself and see if

---------02:30----------
there's anything obvious because if

---------02:31----------
there's an obvious thing that's causing

---------02:32----------
the short-circuit like let's say a

---------02:34----------
capacitor that's clearly exploded that

---------02:36----------
saves me a step of having to go back to

---------02:37----------
the office and steals thermal camera and

---------02:39----------
plug it in and all that good stuff so

---------02:41----------
we're gonna turn on our good old

---------02:43----------
handy-dandy microscope camera which I am

---------02:47----------
very happy to have this is the last one

---------02:49----------
that I can find has this tubes see this

---------02:51----------
if you buy any other camera from AM

---------02:54----------
scope or Oh mono at the microscope calm

---------02:56----------
or AM scope at any other company it is

---------02:58----------
that really long microscope tube try on

---------03:01----------
the trinocular port and it sucks the

---------03:03----------
image quality is getting it has the

---------03:05----------
chromatic abrasions it's it's out of

---------03:06----------
focus and certain areas are not and

---------03:08----------
others just it's not the same as this

---------03:11----------
I've tried so many things to get it good

---------03:12----------
this is beautiful I love this one

---------03:14----------
but this one will not fit on the newer

---------03:16----------
microscopes that I get from them even if

---------03:18----------
the same model this one over here

---------03:19----------
beautiful one of a kind

---------03:22----------
I'm never letting Kevin let somebody

---------03:24----------
steal this never never it's my

---------03:28----------
microscope camera ok I cannot see any

---------03:30----------
obviously exploded capacitor or IC hmm

---------03:40----------
yeah that's not

---------03:54----------
all right now though Thank You Nash for

---------03:56----------
the $5 by the way I have several air

---------04:00----------
purifiers actually I have I have two

---------04:03----------
alive air purifiers and two other ones

---------04:05----------
in the store and I change them as often

---------04:07----------
as I can

---------04:08----------
the thing is I don't know where the dead

---------04:10----------
rat smell is coming from and now have

---------04:17----------
you found where the dead rat smell is

---------04:18----------
coming from

---------04:21----------
yeah can you perhaps figure out where

---------04:23----------
that can you find the dead rat and know

---------04:30----------
what if it's not here but it's there's

---------04:33----------
somebody a homeless man died in the

---------04:35----------
basement no cuz that's happened to me

---------04:37----------
before not the homeless man dying in the

---------04:38----------
basement did I ever tell you that the

---------04:41----------
basement story all right so there was a

---------04:43----------
so I went downstairs and I had this

---------04:46----------
thing open and had the gate open let it

---------04:47----------
started to stream and I noticed oh crap

---------04:48----------
the basements open I lock it and then I

---------04:50----------
come back out about 4 or 5 hours later

---------04:52----------
when I'm done with a long stream and

---------04:53----------
then and I hear banging and then I open

---------04:56----------
it's like you locked me down then I said

---------04:57----------
you broke into my [ __ ] basement

---------04:58----------
[ __ ]

---------04:59----------
III don't check my basement to see if

---------05:02----------
there's a homeless man sleeping in it

---------05:03----------
hope you there's a seam there Oreo does

---------05:06----------
I tell him don't go in the closet don't

---------05:07----------
go in the closet I open the closet to

---------05:09----------
get my jacket you runs in I closed the

---------05:10----------
door and then I kept that come home and

---------05:12----------
he's going oh oh oh it's like you

---------05:14----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] I told you not to go in

---------05:16----------
the closet we've been over this every

---------05:17----------
single day for two years but yeah so

---------05:21----------
just make sure there's no homeless

---------05:22----------
person down there also take a box cutter

---------05:23----------
with you in case the homeless person

---------05:25----------
down there as a weapon or at least a

---------05:28----------
nice sharp set of tweezers

---------05:37----------
and I was a trooper all right so I'm not

---------05:40----------
finding anything obvious on here so

---------05:41----------
we're gonna turn on the power supply

---------05:42----------
that I fixed the other day had to make

---------05:44----------
sure to make my credibility back from

---------05:46----------
that little Internet where were your

---------05:48----------
[ __ ] that said I don't have

---------05:50----------
credibility because I don't know

---------05:52----------
everything so we fixed that power supply

---------05:53----------
in the proper manner no I am going to

---------05:56----------
put that on my board I'm gonna put a

---------05:57----------
volt into the gonna put one volt into PP

---------06:01----------
bus and see what comes out actually one

---------06:04----------
thing we can do so check this out this

---------06:06----------
is a good trick so I only invited 2.8

---------06:08----------
volts into that which even if the CPU

---------06:09----------
MOSFET was short it would be fine so I'm

---------06:12----------
gonna check my resistance between my PP

---------06:16----------
buzz g3 hot and my CPU coils so remember

---------06:24----------
so 3.6 ohms to ground so remember TP

---------06:27----------
pressure short it's a crown cpu v core

---------06:30----------
is always going to be a very low

---------06:31----------
resistance to ground but at least it's

---------06:32----------
high enough that I don't think it's

---------06:34----------
something too terrible 3.6 ohms is good

---------06:36----------
so we're not directly shorted so if that

---------06:39----------
was zero then I would say CPU MOSFETs

---------06:41----------
are what is short it's pp bus and that's

---------06:43----------
what's causing our issue but it's not

---------06:45----------
now I don't feel like walking to the

---------06:46----------
back of the store to get the the thermal

---------06:50----------
cam I'm being really lazy so what I'm

---------06:55----------
gonna do is you know

---------07:07----------
how come you don't work in the back of

---------07:08----------
the store because I don't that's because

---------07:12----------
I don't because I work up here

---------07:15----------
that's why okay so anything obviously

---------07:21----------
shortened oh I see smoke really pretty

---------07:28----------
small look at that see compact pro

---------07:33----------
requires no walking to the back yeah but

---------07:39----------
that requires money

---------07:41----------
I broke I spent all my money on data

---------07:44----------
recovery stuff no more money I'm out of

---------07:48----------
money

---------07:49----------
okay which one of these caps is it I'm

---------07:52----------
pretty sure that it's the one all the

---------07:53----------
way on the right because if you notice

---------07:56----------
the capacitor all the way on the right

---------07:57----------
is the one that has no like liquid on it

---------08:00----------
so every time I do this the liquid heats

---------08:02----------
away from those caps but it's totally

---------08:04----------
gone from this one so here we're going

---------08:09----------
to see how the taught tweezers are at

---------08:11----------
fixing that

---------08:13----------
[Music]

---------08:15----------
turn off the voltage and let's see how

---------08:19----------
long it takes I'm gonna school so the

---------08:21----------
tweezers just beeped I'm holding it up

---------08:22----------
like this let's see how long it takes

---------08:24----------
for the cats come off in the board to

---------08:25----------
drop one two three four five six seven

---------08:33----------
eight nine ten this is one of the

---------08:38----------
reasons I hate hot tweezers look at the

---------08:39----------
sweeps

---------08:40----------
one two three four useless piece of [ __ ]

---------08:49----------
how the [ __ ] is Jessie used those is

---------08:51----------
beyond me aha tweezers and you may say

---------08:55----------
that's a big component point taken it

---------08:57----------
does that even with zero four zero two

---------08:58----------
as it drives me up a [ __ ] wall

---------09:12----------
and one to yank

---------09:21----------
Spock ha geezers

---------09:24----------
[Music]

---------09:32----------
alright you got the rest of that

---------09:34----------
capacitor that I knocked off over there

---------09:38----------
and we got rid of any of the junk left

---------09:40----------
over on the pad now we get as long as a

---------09:50----------
donor board and replace that capacitor

---------09:53----------
with a better one well feel happier more

---------10:01----------
products the Loess upgrade to thread

---------10:03----------
ripper - are you effing kidding it spent

---------10:05----------
3000 bucks on this one already

---------10:07----------
hell no I wasn't spending three or four

---------10:10----------
hundred dollars on water cooling that

---------10:11----------
actually worked now this system is far

---------10:15----------
too high-end already now it gets twenty

---------10:17----------
five thousand and twenty six thousand on

---------10:19----------
CPU benchmark so if you got a CPU

---------10:20----------
benchmarks website you'll see the my

---------10:22----------
thread Ripper 29 50 X 25 thousands for

---------10:25----------
my old machine it was a core i7 5820k or

---------10:30----------
57 20 or 50 930 I forget was the six

---------10:34----------
core 3.3 gigahertz hazlo whichever one

---------10:36----------
was in 64 3.3 two guards as well it was

---------10:39----------
about a 12 or a 13 thousand I think was

---------10:41----------
like 11 or 12 thousand on there so I

---------10:43----------
typically do not upgrade my CPU until

---------10:46----------
the score on CPU benchmark is a full

---------10:49----------
double of what it was in the old one

---------10:50----------
because if it's not twice as fast then

---------10:53----------
I'm putting a lot of effort in a lot of

---------10:54----------
time and a lot of money into it for no

---------10:56----------
reason

---------10:57----------
that's why I really don't get people

---------10:59----------
that are constantly at constantly

---------11:00----------
upgrading this they're always looking at

---------11:04----------
these benchmarks all the time because

---------11:05----------
there was there was a time where every

---------11:07----------
in a year to 18 months you were getting

---------11:09----------
some genuine really cool improvements

---------11:11----------
and now that just doesn't exist anymore

---------11:14----------
you know you can it it took five years

---------11:17----------
after I bought that processor to get

---------11:20----------
twice the performance and you have to

---------11:22----------
keep in mind that doubling of the

---------11:23----------
performance also came at three times the

---------11:25----------
price so my the six core has well 3.3

---------11:28----------
gigahertz that I got I bought that for

---------11:31----------
340 or $350 in free shipping at the time

---------11:34----------
whereas the thread Ripper it that one

---------11:36----------
cost me over

---------11:37----------
$900 so after five years you still had

---------11:41----------
to pay three times as much money than he

---------11:42----------
did five years ago in order to get twice

---------11:45----------
the performance so I'm not really

---------11:48----------
excited I don't know I'm not excited

---------11:50----------
about upgrading stuff at all

---------11:51----------
there's no real there's no reason for it

---------11:56----------
for the amount of money that you have to

---------11:58----------
spend to get an upgrade that way you're

---------12:01----------
really going to notice a genuine

---------12:02----------
difference you have to spend a stupid

---------12:05----------
amount of money now if there's some sort

---------12:07----------
of system out there where I could have

---------12:08----------
you know four Xeon CPUs and if I could

---------12:11----------
have four Xeon CPUs in one machine then

---------12:14----------
sure I would do it you know if I had the

---------12:17----------
money to get four Xeon CPUs in one

---------12:19----------
computer then I could see you buy the

---------12:21----------
best Xeon there is you buy four of them

---------12:22----------
that's an upgrade pay this incremental

---------12:25----------
stuff like this there's no excitement

---------12:27----------
amazing I used to have a twenty five

---------12:30----------
thousand benchmark score and now I have

---------12:32----------
a twenty six thousand CPU benchmarks for

---------12:35----------
no no boring and as can be seen here it

---------12:42----------
is taking five hundred milliamps which

---------12:44----------
means it is turning on and working so it

---------12:46----------
just had one bad capacitor we were able

---------12:48----------
to find the short without use of the

---------12:49----------
thermal camera just by injecting voltage

---------12:51----------
using our power supply and I remember if

---------12:53----------
you do have a short circuit on P P bunch

---------12:54----------
d3 hot I would check if you have a short

---------12:57----------
circuit between TP h g3 hot and the

---------12:59----------
coils of any other other power supplies

---------13:00----------
the reason I would do that is let P P by

---------13:02----------
Z 3 hot is the power rail that is going

---------13:04----------
to be responsible for creating all the

---------13:06----------
other power L so these systems are gonna

---------13:07----------
have PP 5 vs 5 PP 5 vs 4 PP FIV s3 p p3

---------13:11----------
v 3s 3p B 3 B 3 s o P P 1 V ADA so if

---------13:14----------
you have the V core CPU v core so all

---------13:16----------
the main power rails in the Commission

---------13:18----------
are created using this line that is 12

---------13:21----------
volts so let's say one of the high side

---------13:23----------
MOSFETs that is the switching so it says

---------13:25----------
okay 12 volts now no 12 volts 12 volts

---------13:27----------
now no 12 volts 12 volts now no 12 volts

---------13:29----------
to create a smaller power line with the

---------13:31----------
5 volt to the 3 volt line let's say that

---------13:33----------
one of those is shorted so it's always

---------13:36----------
on you don't want to put voltage into

---------13:39----------
your pp bus which is 12 volts and if

---------13:42----------
your 12 volts is shorted to your 5 volt

---------13:44----------
line or your 3 volt line or your 1 ball

---------13:45----------
line because then whatever voltage you

---------13:47----------
inject it in is now going to be going

---------13:49----------
directly into

---------13:51----------
those lower rails which is why I stick

---------13:53----------
to a voltage that is lower than the

---------13:54----------
lowest rail when I'm injecting so even

---------13:56----------
though I do make that measurement to

---------13:57----------
make sure that my main power line my PP

---------14:00----------
much d3 hot is not shorted to any of the

---------14:02----------
other coils what I do is I also make

---------14:05----------
sure that the voltage and the power

---------14:07----------
supply is that of the lowest rail in the

---------14:10----------
machine so let's say CPU V core is 0.9

---------14:12----------
volts

---------14:12----------
just in case PP bus is shorting to

---------14:14----------
everything I make sure that I set the

---------14:16----------
power supply to point 8 volts and try to

---------14:18----------
find the short that way this way even if

---------14:20----------
I do a Mitch measurement or make a

---------14:22----------
mistake and pbht 3 hot it is shorted

---------14:24----------
through another power line or through

---------14:26----------
another FET I'm not skull-fucking the

---------14:29----------
entire machine so we just see if this

---------14:32----------
gives us a picture on the screen ok and

---------14:34----------
this light is actually blowing out the

---------14:36----------
light of the MacBook so you can't see

---------14:38----------
that there's a question mark folder

---------14:39----------
there see question mark folder and if I

---------14:46----------
booted into the operating system I'd be

---------14:47----------
able to raise the brightness so this

---------14:49----------
board has been fixed it just needed that

---------14:51----------
one little capacitor knocked off of the

---------14:54----------
board another machine saved from the

---------14:56----------
Genius Bar another machine saved from

---------14:58----------
the hands of this individual
