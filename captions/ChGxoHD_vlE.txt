---------00:00----------
for the first MacBook we have here is a

---------00:01----------
MacBook that had a little bit of water

---------00:03----------
damage was fixed by ultrasonic but now

---------00:05----------
has no sound we're gonna try and figure

---------00:07----------
out why this a 1708 MacBook has no sound

---------00:09----------
what do you tell customers that don't

---------00:11----------
feel like component-level is a safe

---------00:13----------
repair credible option what I do if they

---------00:16----------
think it's not safe or credible is I

---------00:17----------
tell them at the Apple Store is on 9th

---------00:20----------
Avenue and 14th Street and it's only

---------00:22----------
about 4 stops on the El train my queue

---------00:26----------
is full enough as is without having to

---------00:28----------
deal with that oh [ __ ] I understand and

---------00:30----------
I respect if you do not want to do it

---------00:33----------
through with this option the Apple Store

---------00:35----------
is the place for you not even saying it

---------00:37----------
sarcastically it's just ok do the thing

---------00:40----------
is you shouldn't try to shove an option

---------00:41----------
down somebody's throat if it's not the

---------00:42----------
option for them there's a good book on

---------00:44----------
this Jim camps start with no figure out

---------00:48----------
what their pain point is most people's

---------00:50----------
pain point is I don't want to wait

---------00:51----------
several weeks and spend you know 750 to

---------00:54----------
1200 dollars but if you're a pain point

---------00:56----------
is I don't think that this is credible

---------00:58----------
then an Apple store is the place for you

---------01:00----------
and if you are actually the right person

---------01:02----------
for them then they'll come back but if

---------01:04----------
you're not then they'll get what they

---------01:05----------
want and everybody will be happy

---------01:07----------
yeah I ain't got no time to be selling

---------01:10----------
people on that this is safe and all that

---------01:12----------
other stuff go to apple.com slash

---------01:16----------
support Thank You Ben I really

---------01:18----------
appreciate that alright so when this

---------01:20----------
MacBook this is gonna be a sound chip

---------01:21----------
appear the service chip and it appears

---------01:25----------
to be totally fine it appears to not

---------01:28----------
have a single problem with it now there

---------01:30----------
are gonna be a certain power rails that

---------01:32----------
go to this audio chip let's take a look

---------01:36----------
at those power rails that go to that

---------01:37----------
audio chip okay so it looks like you use

---------01:40----------
6200 okay that's HD a bridge so I'm

---------01:43----------
guessing HD a is high-definition audio

---------01:45----------
and guessing speakers speaker so there's

---------01:47----------
a couple of power rails that need to be

---------01:48----------
coming in here PP one v8 uh so as to

---------01:50----------
show up it looks like PP one v8s oh is

---------01:53----------
the power rail that's going to this chip

---------01:54----------
so how do we get PP one v8s Oh

---------01:57----------
glass that's creepy so that's why I went

---------02:01----------
outside to talk to us that he wouldn't

---------02:02----------
be coming in here there's somebody

---------02:04----------
pointing at me outside

---------02:05----------
Kevin shield me Kevin protect me okay so

---------02:11----------
the first thing we're gonna do while

---------02:12----------
Kevin is my body guard against the

---------02:14----------
person outside that's probably looking

---------02:16----------
to steal the tip jar again come come

---------02:19----------
with me try and take my tip jar where's

---------02:21----------
my baseball bat where's my baseball bow

---------02:25----------
I'll take this microscope and shove it

---------02:28----------
up your ass so what was pointing at me

---------02:31----------
through the window who you're the one

---------02:42----------
who allowed this to happen I have PTSD

---------02:48----------
now I fix boards like this I'm gonna

---------02:53----------
measure my power

---------02:54----------
can anybody measure pp1 v8s Oh for me is

---------02:56----------
pp one v8s oh here it is so power is

---------03:01----------
going into the audio chip did you have

---------03:04----------
did you fix the MacBook the macbook the

---------03:07----------
ghost knocked over yes who keeps the tip

---------03:08----------
jar Kevin gets the tips everyone gets

---------03:13----------
the tips besides it besides me I wanted

---------03:16----------
to only get tips from YouTube so what do

---------03:20----------
we have here and what appears so not

---------03:21----------
that that power rail is there so most

---------03:24----------
likely we're looking at bad audio chip

---------03:26----------
cuz keep in mind the only corrosion that

---------03:29----------
we had on that you're wait wait wait

---------03:30----------
wait wait wait wait whoa whoa

---------03:32----------
okay now this makes no damn sense

---------03:34----------
corrosion on backlight circuit but we

---------03:36----------
have a backlight no corrosion on audio

---------03:39----------
circuit but no audio I think I'm getting

---------03:41----------
trolled here I think that I'm getting

---------03:45----------
trolled

---------03:48----------
i reflow i think i'm going to be a noob

---------03:54----------
in go i reflow yeah i reflow and see if

---------03:58----------
it were killa says i'm in new york and i

---------04:01----------
come by and say hi

---------04:02----------
are you gonna take my tip jar like I'm

---------04:04----------
gonna get I'll get you I'll get you you

---------04:07----------
try to take my tip jar I kill you

---------04:40----------
all right now here's the bad thing about

---------04:42----------
testing sound you have to actually put

---------04:45----------
the machine back together boot up into

---------04:47----------
an operating system each time you want

---------04:49----------
to test and see if sound is fixed that

---------04:50----------
sucks that really really sucks that's a

---------04:53----------
huge waste of time it's not like fan

---------04:56----------
spin and d'Honneur screen and done it's

---------04:57----------
it's it's time-consuming because you

---------05:00----------
have to plug it all the stuff back and

---------05:01----------
get a test our ass no output device is

---------05:04----------
found no input device is found so there

---------05:07----------
is no audio here so not only no output

---------05:11----------
but also no input meaning that its most

---------05:13----------
likely a bad audio I see wait a second

---------05:15----------
there's another chip for audio isn't

---------05:17----------
there yeah there's another chip for

---------05:19----------
audio there's two I only checked one I'm

---------05:21----------
dumb

---------05:22----------
okay there's use 6300 we need PP 3 v 3s

---------05:24----------
Oh to go through this filter n 1 v 8 now

---------05:26----------
1 v 8 is already present we already

---------05:28----------
checked that what we need is to see if L

---------05:30----------
4 at 6 302 is blown which it probably is

---------05:32----------
I would guess L that is belong this is

---------05:35----------
kind of like acting as a fuse between PP

---------05:37----------
3 V 3 s oh and the audio codec chip

---------05:39----------
so let's find L 3 6 so 2 L 3 6 where is

---------05:44----------
L 3 602 now when you right-click it it's

---------05:48----------
supposed to show you and paul daniels of

---------05:49----------
software where it is here we go it's

---------05:52----------
showing so let's check under it alright

---------05:54----------
that chip also looks perfectly fine with

---------05:55----------
no visible corrosion so I want to see if

---------05:58----------
I have voltage there wait a second

---------06:01----------
what's this hey your chipped your

---------06:05----------
chipped what are you little chip look

---------06:08----------
it's it's a glass chip and it is chipped

---------06:11----------
in the corner what are the what is that

---------06:13----------
foreign can I jump it I want to jump it

---------06:15----------
what are you you are an L you take 3.3

---------06:21----------
volts and you turn it into 1.8 volts for

---------06:23----------
the audio codec hmm and you're cracked

---------06:29----------
okay so let's see does the voltage come

---------06:32----------
out of this thing let's check on C 6-3

---------06:35----------
6-1 C 6-3 6-1 we're gonna see if any

---------06:39----------
voltage comes out of this we have three

---------06:45----------
point three okay do we have three point

---------06:47----------
three going into the chip yes we do

---------06:49----------
solid three point three next up is we're

---------06:51----------
gonna see if 1.8 volts is coming out of

---------06:53----------
ldli see and interesting so check this

---------06:57----------
out we're not getting 1.8 volts out of

---------06:58----------
the LDO we're getting 0.3 now an l do is

---------07:01----------
a chip that's going to take a really low

---------07:03----------
voltage and turn it into a slightly

---------07:04----------
lower voltage so a buck converter is

---------07:06----------
gonna take something like 12 volts and

---------07:08----------
turn it to 512 volts turn it to 3 8

---------07:10----------
volts turn it to 1 and L do is going to

---------07:12----------
take something like 5 volts and turn

---------07:14----------
into 4 volts so what's when you want a

---------07:16----------
really small voltage differential that's

---------07:18----------
what an L do is going to do in here we

---------07:20----------
have an L do that is supposed to take

---------07:22----------
3.3 volt and turn it into 1.8 volts yet

---------07:26----------
that little piece is cracked and it's

---------07:27----------
also only putting out point 3 volts

---------07:30----------
instead of what it's mostly putting out

---------07:31----------
so we are going to try replacing this

---------07:33----------
teeny-tiny glass chip with another one

---------07:36----------
and these these strips are really easy

---------07:37----------
to break look at this this is very very

---------07:39----------
easy to break see that like just you can

---------07:43----------
just chip away at this so easily these

---------07:45----------
these are not look at that BAM it just

---------07:47----------
comes off so easily so we're gonna

---------07:51----------
remove that chip from the board the same

---------07:52----------
way we're moving Kevin from payroll and

---------07:54----------
see if this works again good night Kevin

---------07:57----------
I'm not kidding about that by the way

---------07:59----------
yeah so reflowing the first chip was an

---------08:05----------
act of complete and utter stupidity so

---------08:07----------
the first act of the first reason that I

---------08:10----------
was dumb is I didn't even check to see

---------08:11----------
that there's 2 chips for audio codec on

---------08:13----------
this board I saw I oh I only thought it

---------08:16----------
was one because I wasn't paying

---------08:17----------
attention that was really dumb you need

---------08:19----------
to pay attention when you do this job

---------08:20----------
and what I was doing just now is

---------08:21----------
unacceptably stupid and you should never

---------08:23----------
do something that unacceptably stupid

---------08:25----------
the second thing is I did not check

---------08:26----------
every rail because yeah 1.8 volts was

---------08:29----------
going to the above chip that was a

---------08:30----------
separate one point a trail of a whole

---------08:33----------
trail than the actual second 1.8 volt

---------08:35----------
rail that's for the audio I see that was

---------08:38----------
really dumb of me and that's inexcusably

---------08:39----------
dumb and it's not something that you

---------08:41----------
should do so we are going to replace

---------08:43----------
that [ __ ] with another one and hope that

---------08:45----------
when we have an on crack they'll do that

---------08:48----------
this works that's also a really

---------08:49----------
difficult chip to harvest because one

---------08:50----------
thing you're going to notice is that

---------08:52----------
that chip is as you saw it was it's

---------08:55----------
really easy to break so it's gonna be

---------08:58----------
fairly difficult to harvest without

---------09:00----------
breaking it in the process so let's see

---------09:03----------
how many we go through before we do it

---------09:04----------
and again

---------09:06----------
be dumb like I am in this video don't be

---------09:08----------
dumb that was unacceptable and anybody

---------09:10----------
that's that stupid shouldn't be fixing

---------09:12----------
boards yet I am here fixing boards

---------09:14----------
because life is not fair and the world

---------09:16----------
is not fair several of you watching this

---------09:18----------
would probably wouldn't have made that

---------09:19----------
very stupid mistake and yet you're the

---------09:22----------
viewer and I'm the board fixer life

---------09:24----------
isn't always fair alright so well you're

---------09:30----------
going to get another one and hope that

---------09:31----------
we can repent for that act of idiocy by

---------09:34----------
making this work

---------09:56----------
hey Louis is my first time catching you

---------09:57----------
live and binging all your stuff for the

---------09:59----------
past two weeks here amazing keep it up

---------10:01----------
thank you very much I'm not that amazing

---------10:02----------
I'm actually pretty stupid as I just

---------10:03----------
showcased in this video but I appreciate

---------10:05----------
that thank you very much for your

---------10:07----------
contribution

---------10:08----------
it is highly appreciated and we'll go

---------10:11----------
towards a burrito

---------10:18----------
I do soldered a BGA chip as if it was a

---------10:21----------
qfn that is a newbie I don't know what

---------10:23----------
is now I'm just going to get rid of the

---------10:27----------
excess solder that I left by the chip

---------10:53----------
then the little solder ball is really

---------10:57----------
hiding in there

---------11:03----------
move out of there mofo can't fit

---------11:08----------
anything in there there we go

---------11:09----------
I just got it sucked into that capacity

---------11:14----------
I'm not gonna be an apple and leave

---------11:17----------
solder balls on the board it's [ __ ]

---------11:19----------
embarrassing

---------11:35----------
this is not an apple store we have

---------11:36----------
quality standards here I will not leave

---------11:39----------
little solder balls and a board then

---------11:42----------
again just touching this chip like

---------11:43----------
breaks it so

---------11:48----------
we are going to have to pick and choose

---------11:49----------
our battles here

---------12:18----------
okay one solder ball gone

---------12:28----------
second solder ball almost gone yes

---------12:32----------
beautiful

---------12:36----------
unlike them authorized repair shops we

---------12:38----------
have quality standards that we try to

---------12:40----------
live up to

---------12:52----------
all right so I'm gonna give that a

---------12:55----------
little bit to cool down and with these

---------12:57----------
boards absorb and dissipate heat much

---------12:59----------
faster than many others so I don't have

---------13:00----------
to give it a lot of time we're gonna put

---------13:02----------
a little time to cool down see for

---------13:03----------
getting 1.8 volts out and see if then we

---------13:05----------
have audio devices recognize this in the

---------13:08----------
operating system which I hope we do mark

---------13:10----------
hasn't been paid yet so I was thinking

---------13:11----------
of doing some BMX riding from building

---------13:13----------
to building tonight I'd love to pay much

---------13:15----------
just I don't think I'd be able to if I

---------13:17----------
was in the hospital it's not that I

---------13:18----------
wouldn't want to pay him I would never

---------13:21----------
do that actually you can have the tip

---------13:30----------
shot we'll call it even

---------13:31----------
let's see if we get 1.8 volts now the

---------13:35----------
board should be pretty cool down alright

---------13:36----------
as you can see we are getting 1.8 volts

---------13:38----------
on that LDO so now I'm pretty sure that

---------13:40----------
if I boot up into an operating system

---------13:42----------
that this MacBook will have audio

---------13:44----------
MacBook MacBook while we're there I'm

---------13:47----------
also not going to allow this little

---------13:49----------
backlight capacitor to stay on the board

---------13:50----------
looking like that we could allow to stay

---------13:52----------
on the board looking like that but that

---------13:53----------
would be mean he leaving a backlight

---------13:54----------
capacitor on the board that looks like

---------13:56----------
this that's the type of thing I would

---------13:57----------
expect of a student from a course that

---------13:59----------
steals their entire branding from

---------14:00----------
another company like Rico in Florida and

---------14:03----------
we don't do like that so we are gonna

---------14:04----------
replace this backlight capacitor with a

---------14:06----------
proper backlight capacitor

---------14:12----------
so tomorrow is gonna be your last night

---------14:14----------
with Oreo isn't it Marc Morial is gonna

---------14:19----------
miss you so much

---------14:29----------
[Music]

---------14:36----------
when are we opening a Fort Lauderdale

---------14:38----------
store together mark you have to open a

---------14:40----------
store right across in the [ __ ] that

---------14:41----------
stole Jessa's branding and course idea I

---------14:45----------
think that would be a great idea so

---------14:50----------
there's an individual who essentially

---------14:52----------
took it literally copied and pasted

---------14:54----------
Jess's masterclass idea but I don't

---------14:57----------
think when I say copied and pasted it I

---------14:58----------
mean they took Jess's ad they like

---------15:01----------
scrubbed out her name and wrote their

---------15:03----------
name in there's no effort put into this

---------15:05----------
like not even five dollars and fiver to

---------15:06----------
make their own thing and I was debating

---------15:08----------
whether or not mark and I should open up

---------15:11----------
a store right across the street from

---------15:12----------
them in Florida not to make money but

---------15:14----------
just to like [ __ ] with them and like I

---------15:16----------
don't care if the store loses ten

---------15:17----------
thousand bucks a month just to screw

---------15:19----------
with them because they they did gesture

---------15:20----------
wrong I don't care if people like take

---------15:22----------
and I you know just open up a competing

---------15:24----------
thing or whatever but when you steal

---------15:25----------
somebody's advertising down to the point

---------15:27----------
of practically copying and pasting their

---------15:28----------
[ __ ] that is so effing lame

---------15:42----------
yeah what a [ __ ] that's a total [ __ ]

---------15:46----------
move I think would be really cool to

---------15:47----------
open up a shop right across the street

---------15:49----------
from there just do stuff at cost just

---------15:51----------
for the [ __ ] of it yeah CPU transfer

---------15:56----------
$100 data recovery a local only hundred

---------15:59----------
dollar iPhone screen repair $20 man

---------16:03----------
Karma's a [ __ ]

---------16:04----------
I like jessa nobody gets to [ __ ] with

---------16:09----------
jessep besides me if anybody's gonna

---------16:11----------
screw Jess over it's going to be

---------16:12----------
somebody here from here not some foreign

---------16:14----------
[ __ ] see you later mark

---------16:36----------
I have as much respect for people who do

---------16:38----------
that type of [ __ ] as I do for people

---------16:40----------
that steal tip jars

---------18:57----------
I'm soldering like a dumbass today

---------19:06----------
what the hell am i doing okay lower the

---------19:10----------
effing air

---------19:18----------
I haven't see the Spotify video

---------19:19----------
regarding Apple

---------19:38----------
all right that's all in the place now we

---------19:41----------
see if we got audio it's gonna wait a

---------19:43----------
minute for everything to cool off sees

---------19:46----------
the internal speakers and it sees the

---------19:49----------
built-in microphones see you could see

---------19:50----------
the bar going up and down let's see if I

---------19:53----------
hit the volume button the keyboard you

---------19:55----------
don't hear anything Carly because I

---------19:56----------
didn't plug the speakers in cuz I'm a

---------19:58----------
lazy bum but you can see look at that

---------20:01----------
look at that oh look at that you can

---------20:06----------
hear everything so now that we've

---------20:09----------
restored pp1 v8 this MacBook has audio

---------20:12----------
so that's it for today and as always I

---------20:15----------
hope you learned something make sure you

---------20:18----------
do are your tip jar cuz if you don't you

---------20:20----------
never know who may be coming for it and

---------20:22----------
if you want an environment check out

---------20:24----------
these videos with no advertisements at

---------20:26----------
all you can check us out on boards dot

---------20:30----------
Rossmann group.com and on boards dot

---------20:32----------
Rossmann group com you can go over here

---------20:34----------
and go repair videos by marvel or

---------20:36----------
problem repair videos by problem and

---------20:39----------
when you click over this thing

---------20:40----------
it'll show you all the different problem

---------20:43----------
types and you can go to something like

---------20:45----------
no green light and charger and it's

---------20:47----------
going to show you every single video

---------20:49----------
I've ever done talking about no green

---------20:51----------
light and the charger right like that or

---------20:54----------
if you want to find videos related to

---------20:57----------
just this specific board which is innate

---------20:59----------
- zero - zero zero one six five you can

---------21:01----------
go repair videos by model and then click

---------21:03----------
eight to zero - zero zero one six five

---------21:07----------
and then you can see all of them these

---------21:09----------
videos were uploaded to Vimeo from the

---------21:13----------
original master copy so they are going

---------21:14----------
to look better and above all if you go

---------21:16----------
watch the videos in Vimeo there's no

---------21:18----------
pre-roll or post roll video ad there is

---------21:21----------
no youtube cancerous comment section and

---------21:23----------
it's a nice little youtube free

---------21:25----------
environment ad free environment so you

---------21:26----------
don't have to watch ads know that

---------21:28----------
nonsense and that's it for today and as

---------21:31----------
always I hope you learned something
