---------00:00----------
all right today we have in a 1278

---------00:02----------
MacBook they say 1278 MacBook has no

---------00:04----------
power let's open up this MacBook and

---------00:06----------
figure out what's going on with it

---------00:08----------
it's another MacBook that's been chosen

---------00:09----------
at random so this MacBook is not turning

---------00:12----------
on this is an ancient 8 to 0 - 3115

---------00:16----------
board dual core Ivy Bridge CPU so we're

---------00:21----------
gonna now we have a light in the charger

---------00:22----------
which means our pp 3 before 2 is present

---------00:24----------
as can be seen here but as our pp bus

---------00:26----------
present it is is our pp 5vs5 present it

---------00:31----------
appears to be now the next question is

---------00:33----------
pp 5 es 3 present and it's not VP 5 es 3

---------00:38----------
is not present hmm 155 es 3 is a short

---------00:42----------
to ground it's always possible PP 5 es 3

---------00:45----------
is a short circuit to ground which to be

---------00:47----------
keeping you from working and look it

---------00:49----------
does have a short circuit to ground

---------00:50----------
that's keeping it from working so we did

---------00:52----------
here as we started going throughout the

---------00:53----------
main power rails went through our pp bus

---------00:56----------
g3 hotter pp 3 before 2 PP 5 vs 5 and

---------00:59----------
then we went to PP 5 es 3 so if I open

---------01:01----------
up the schematic and the board view for

---------01:03----------
this board you'll be able to get an idea

---------01:04----------
of what it is that I was looking at when

---------01:07----------
I was looking at these these lovely

---------01:08----------
things here so if I open up the

---------01:10----------
schematic in the board view and I go to

---------01:12----------
page 7 on this one you're going to see

---------01:13----------
that we have a list of rails and I was

---------01:16----------
measuring them one by one by one so we

---------01:18----------
checked for our pp bus g3 huh it says

---------01:21----------
over here supposed to be twelve point

---------01:22----------
eight it was twelve point six close

---------01:23----------
enough we checked pp 3 v4 - we take the

---------01:26----------
voltage er there it was three point

---------01:28----------
three close enough PP 5 es 5 we check

---------01:30----------
for that it was where it's supposed to

---------01:32----------
be then we checked for PP 5 es 3 PP 5 es

---------01:35----------
3 is gonna show up on this capacitor

---------01:37----------
over here and it wasn't showing up so

---------01:40----------
then what we did is we tried to figure

---------01:41----------
out if we had a short to ground so we

---------01:43----------
did I just went to that cup area - that

---------01:45----------
capacitor I have no power plugged into

---------01:47----------
the board as you can see here point 4

---------01:50----------
ohm short to ground and I'm at using

---------01:53----------
resistance mode so that means that there

---------01:55----------
is a short circuit of ground we're gonna

---------01:56----------
have to find in this MacBook so I'm just

---------01:58----------
gonna take this MacBook out of the case

---------01:59----------
and we are going to get started

---------02:01----------
troubleshooting and figuring out what it

---------02:03----------
is that is shorting our power rail to

---------02:05----------
ground you all excited folks hope you're

---------02:08----------
all excited that we're gonna fix yet

---------02:09----------
another MacBook cuz that's we do here on

---------02:11----------
this channel as we fix MacBooks so we're

---------02:13----------
gonna lower

---------02:14----------
my powers apply down to five volts maybe

---------02:16----------
even just one volt and output that into

---------02:18----------
where I think the short circuit is

---------02:20----------
according the somatic and board view PP

---------02:21----------
5 vs 3 is right here

---------02:26----------
[Music]

---------02:46----------
all right we're using five amps at 1.9

---------02:49----------
volt so this is a short that should be

---------02:51----------
fairly obvious to fine as you all know

---------02:53----------
I'm in the front of the store

---------02:54----------
not the back of the store and the

---------02:56----------
thermal camera is in the back of the

---------02:59----------
store and so that means that I would

---------03:00----------
have to walk to the back of the store in

---------03:03----------
order to use the thermal camera to find

---------03:04----------
shorts and that is absolutely not worth

---------03:07----------
the proposition look if I have to walk I

---------03:10----------
have to do any sort of work of any kind

---------03:12----------
not doing it not doing it so we're gonna

---------03:15----------
try to find the short circuit using

---------03:16----------
alcohol which I do have here in the

---------03:19----------
front of the store and if I can find the

---------03:21----------
short circuit using alcohol then I can

---------03:22----------
show you how to do this without having

---------03:24----------
to spend money on a thermal camera which

---------03:26----------
i think is way too much money for this

---------03:28----------
profession given how proficient one can

---------03:30----------
be with alcohol

---------03:41----------
okay so Tim Herman of TC RS circuit said

---------03:46----------
that the short is most likely near the

---------03:48----------
audio circuit and I want to show you

---------03:49----------
just how high-quality the advice that

---------03:52----------
you can get by going to TC RS circuit

---------03:55----------
dot repair slash contact - us that's TC

---------03:57----------
RS circuit dot repair slash contact - us

---------04:00----------
is if you need free advice on how to fix

---------04:02----------
your own motherboard if you take a look

---------04:04----------
at this board and we take a look at the

---------04:06----------
audio chip you'll notice that the

---------04:08----------
melting is happening right by the audio

---------04:10----------
IC which means that he was indeed

---------04:12----------
correct Wow look at that

---------04:16----------
imagine that this is the again the

---------04:18----------
quality of free help that you will get

---------04:20----------
from Tim Herrmann is utterly amazing

---------04:22----------
look at that look at that Wow folks I'm

---------04:27----------
telling you this kid is talented he knew

---------04:30----------
what was wrong with my board what we're

---------04:31----------
gonna do now is we're gonna remove that

---------04:32----------
cap and let's just take a look at on the

---------04:35----------
schematic and board view all waiting for

---------04:36----------
my hot air to get up get heat it up so

---------04:39----------
it looks like it's this cap over here

---------04:41----------
which is a long TP 5 vs 3 c this.c 6213

---------04:46----------
that is on people has one leg on PP 5 vs

---------04:48----------
3 one leg on ground that capacitor is

---------04:50----------
able to short circuit to ground if it

---------04:52----------
fails is able to send all the 5 volts to

---------04:55----------
ground so we're gonna remove that and

---------04:56----------
then this is gonna work right again

---------04:58----------
isn't it now is beautiful absolutely

---------05:02----------
beautiful and we couldn't have done it

---------05:05----------
without free help from 10 @ TC RS

---------05:09----------
circuit dot repair slash contact - UPS

---------05:11----------
don't delay contact em for free help on

---------05:14----------
how to fix your board today

---------05:17----------
this cap doesn't look bad either so it

---------05:20----------
really would trick you look at that

---------05:21----------
there's nothing you know there's no

---------05:23----------
solder ball next to it there's no

---------05:24----------
discoloration

---------05:25----------
there's no slash on it or anything

---------05:33----------
[Music]

---------05:56----------
[Music]

---------06:01----------
you didn't take a recipe all-nighter

---------06:03----------
what am rest you crazy

---------06:05----------
there are Mac books that need to be

---------06:06----------
fixed there are many Mac books that need

---------06:08----------
to be fixed so as we can see here look

---------06:12----------
at that look at that look at that fan

---------06:14----------
spin so you had a short-circuit I'm

---------06:17----------
people 5 es 3 remove the short-circuit

---------06:18----------
we found that short-circuit by injecting

---------06:20----------
a volt into the board pouring alcohol on

---------06:22----------
it and seeing what gets hot

---------06:23----------
very high-tech methodology here we use

---------06:26----------
it rossmann group but it does work it is

---------06:27----------
fast that is efficient and it is cheap

---------06:29----------
and above all it is easily replicable at

---------06:32----------
home by people who do not have super

---------06:34----------
expensive equipment which is what I'm

---------06:36----------
trying to get across that you don't need

---------06:37----------
to have the highest end setup to get

---------06:40----------
stuff done just got to use your brain a

---------06:42----------
little bit and if you use your brain you

---------06:43----------
can make the fan spin that's all I want

---------06:47----------
is to see that fan spin and if you can

---------06:52----------
do that then you too can fix a macbook

---------06:55----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------06:57----------
you learned something with that we move

---------06:59----------
on to the next macbook

---------07:08----------
