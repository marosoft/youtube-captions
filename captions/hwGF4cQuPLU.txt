---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're gonna be going over another dead

---------00:02----------
macbook this was brought to me after a

---------00:04----------
wine spill and I'll let you take a look

---------00:06----------
over here this is what happens after

---------00:09----------
pretty much one day from what I hear one

---------00:12----------
day I took a q-tip and some alcohol to

---------00:16----------
it just to get an idea of how bad it was

---------00:18----------
they said it was intermittent like

---------00:20----------
sometimes turning on and now they were

---------00:22----------
afraid to turn it on which probably

---------00:23----------
means it wasn't turning on and honestly

---------00:25----------
again this is after cleaning what it

---------00:26----------
looks like those joints around the 5

---------00:29----------
volt and 3.3 volt area around the TPS

---------00:31----------
509 a0 are quite disgusting now one of

---------00:34----------
the unique and interesting things about

---------00:36----------
this machine is that even if you want to

---------00:40----------
do the right thing which is unplug the

---------00:41----------
battery so that the corrosion doesn't

---------00:43----------
begin because even if you get liquid on

---------00:45----------
it doesn't matter if the battery is

---------00:46----------
unplugged and the electricity is not

---------00:47----------
flowing through it you can't because the

---------00:49----------
bottom cover of the machine is not held

---------00:51----------
to the machine with Torx screws or

---------00:53----------
Phillips screws or standard screws it's

---------00:55----------
using a special snowflake pentalobe

---------00:57----------
screwdriver which means that you can't

---------01:00----------
just go to Home Depot or your local

---------01:01----------
electronics store and buy this you need

---------01:04----------
to buy it online what does that mean

---------01:05----------
that means that by the time you get the

---------01:07----------
screwdriver so that you can open your

---------01:09----------
machine and unplug the battery you've

---------01:10----------
already had three or four seven days

---------01:12----------
worth of corrosion set in which is what

---------01:15----------
happened to this person because they

---------01:16----------
wanted to do the right thing they they

---------01:17----------
you know they turned it off they

---------01:18----------
unplugged it you know they they turns it

---------01:21----------
upside down blue you know try to have a

---------01:23----------
fan blow the water out of it a lot kind

---------01:25----------
of stuff but the right thing to do would

---------01:27----------
have been to take the bottom cover off

---------01:29----------
and get rid of the corrosion or at least

---------01:32----------
unplug the battery immediately so the

---------01:33----------
damage doesn't happen but the damage is

---------01:35----------
gonna happen all they had to do is use a

---------01:37----------
standard screwdriver like t3 and you

---------01:39----------
could you could address this yourself

---------01:40----------
anyway so let's take a look and see what

---------01:42----------
it is this board is doing I'm gonna turn

---------01:44----------
on the power supply here set my power

---------01:46----------
supply be on the screen turn on a Paul

---------01:49----------
Daniels multimeter software that we all

---------01:51----------
love so much here and on this channel

---------01:54----------
plug it in see what we get so it's

---------01:58----------
taking 49 to 50 milliamps which is

---------02:02----------
actually means that this this may have a

---------02:04----------
chance of being saved because usually

---------02:05----------
when it's taking 20 to 30 milliamps that

---------02:07----------
means that p.m. sleep s4l is missing and

---------02:11----------
getting it nightmares about that one now

---------02:13----------
if we take a look at the schematic in

---------02:15----------
the board view using Paul Daniels is

---------02:16----------
amazing software you'll see that this

---------02:20----------
area over here that is corroded is

---------02:21----------
responsible for two main power rails in

---------02:24----------
the system P P 3 P 3 S 5 and over here

---------02:29----------
PP 5e s 3 but it's also responsible for

---------02:33----------
an LD o PP 5 V S 5 and that is going to

---------02:38----------
be right over here PP 5e s 5l do so

---------02:42----------
let's see if any of those are present

---------02:44----------
right now so I'm going to click figure

---------02:46----------
out where they are so P P 5 V s 5 this

---------02:54----------
is all the corrosion is in this area the

---------02:56----------
rest of it had did not corrode even

---------02:58----------
though there were liquid in other areas

---------02:59----------
there's not a lot of voltage going

---------03:00----------
through those other areas so they have

---------03:02----------
not corroded yet so if we check out P P

---------03:04----------
5vs5 on c7 v 0 v C we get a zero volts P

---------03:18----------
P 3 v 3 s 5 according to the schematic

---------03:20----------
and board view we can find pp 3 v 3 s 5

---------03:25----------
on a resistor located over here let's

---------03:29----------
see if that's present

---------03:48----------
zero all right so the first thing I'm

---------03:51----------
gonna do is common sense based let's get

---------03:58----------
rid of the stuff shall we let's wipe

---------04:01----------
this and start fresh let's remove

---------04:10----------
everything that looks like we're damaged

---------04:18----------
not even Mike

---------04:20----------
not even

---------04:50----------
come on

---------04:53----------
um

---------04:57----------
all right you gotta go you go here you

---------05:01----------
go

---------05:02----------
get out of here this stuff looks like

---------05:06----------
it's probably fine that can just use

---------05:08----------
minor touch up your corroded your

---------05:11----------
corroded

---------05:38----------
move that back in a place in a moment

---------05:43----------
yes

---------05:48----------
all right now this dad pet over here

---------05:50----------
looks to be severely damaged and I'm

---------05:53----------
gonna guess that's where PP budged III

---------05:54----------
hot the main 12 point 56 volts and the

---------05:57----------
battery is coming into the chip and I'm

---------06:00----------
actually wrong it's where PP 5 es 5 is

---------06:04----------
going to come out of the chip either way

---------06:06----------
we're still gonna have to rehabilitate

---------06:08----------
that pad in if it's not really be

---------06:11----------
rehabilitated then we will just have to

---------06:14----------
run a jumper no big deal no skin off my

---------06:18----------
back no big deal

---------06:24----------
how's everybody in the chat doing today

---------06:26----------
I hope you're all doing well all right

---------06:31----------
yeah that pat is done for it so let's

---------06:32----------
see we're gonna see if there's a nub

---------06:34----------
under there in a moment but first let's

---------06:36----------
wick away all that nasty old solder and

---------06:40----------
put some news

---------07:11----------
we don't talk about the jumper from two

---------07:13----------
nights ago Donald it never happened

---------07:18----------
we don't like to talk about that here

---------07:22----------
that never happened

---------07:45----------
oh you'll see soon sippy

---------08:14----------
one time I buy an esd-safe tool and this

---------08:17----------
is what I get

---------08:18----------
see this [ __ ] esd-safe no I hate these

---------08:30----------
things

---------08:31----------
[ __ ] this

---------08:56----------
there is alcohol in it where am I

---------08:59----------
getting this alcohol from John to como

---------09:02----------
am i spitting on the board and my saliva

---------09:04----------
is turning to alcohol

---------09:06----------
no that is alcohol from this which is

---------09:09----------
still 33% full look at that look at that

---------09:13----------
this alcohol straw reaches down that far

---------09:17----------
straw reaches down that far ain't no

---------09:21----------
excuse for this I hate alcohol

---------09:25----------
dispensers hate him

---------09:27----------
terrible all these all speck alcohol

---------09:32----------
dispensers um I'm fighting these things

---------09:36----------
for seven years now and they keep

---------09:37----------
winning

---------09:39----------
how much is renting a billboard for you

---------09:42----------
across from the Apple store you know

---------09:43----------
what that honestly you say that as a

---------09:45----------
joke but that's not a bad idea because

---------09:48----------
even if it gets to the point where I'm

---------09:50----------
the only person here you know we got

---------09:56----------
some people that work here that have

---------09:58----------
held that live with the elderly and you

---------10:01----------
know they they think they're at the

---------10:03----------
moment stay at home even if we get to

---------10:05----------
the point where literally I'm the only

---------10:06----------
person here I can still do stuff like

---------10:09----------
this you know I could still do my job

---------10:11----------
and my god people with the people that

---------10:14----------
are showing up there's not a lot of

---------10:15----------
people showing up but the people that

---------10:17----------
are showing up they are panicked because

---------10:19----------
they know that they have no like this is

---------10:22----------
it yeah I'll be staring at the screen

---------10:26----------
when the UV gets applied the Stephanie

---------10:29----------
Pauline nice what's up

---------10:31----------
Stephanie Polly nice

---------10:35----------
yes you will

---------10:39----------
so

---------10:42----------
the people that are showing up are

---------10:43----------
fairly high-strung like what am I gonna

---------10:46----------
get it back is it gonna work with my

---------10:48----------
date because this is what they're

---------10:49----------
working from yeah this is it

---------10:52----------
it's not like they're going into the

---------10:53----------
office to get their computer or that

---------10:56----------
they can work on someone else's can't

---------10:58----------
even go to the Apple store to get

---------10:59----------
another one it's make this thing work or

---------11:01----------
they're screwed

---------11:02----------
so the people that have been showing up

---------11:06----------
have been a bit more high-strung and

---------11:10----------
understandably so yeah thank you they

---------11:13----------
got a job to do cuz they never shut down

---------11:15----------
in New York starting Monday there is but

---------11:16----------
the definition of essential business is

---------11:19----------
I've seen that website get edited

---------11:20----------
several times so what is or is not an

---------11:24----------
essential business it is kind of up in

---------11:26----------
the air

---------11:54----------
if you tape signs in the Apple store

---------11:56----------
door or Apple employees gonna take them

---------11:57----------
down you know what I'll leave that up to

---------12:02----------
the comment section on this video once

---------12:03----------
it's done should Lewis put a sign on the

---------12:08----------
Apple store that says if you want your

---------12:10----------
device fixed come to 141 West 27

---------12:18----------
as I actually did ask the city I wanted

---------12:21----------
to pay for a permit to do a live stream

---------12:22----------
in front of the Apple store and I'm not

---------12:25----------
sure how many people heard this one so I

---------12:27----------
was actually going to pay money I wanted

---------12:30----------
to do a live stream in front of an Apple

---------12:32----------
Store and it was gonna be you know on

---------12:35----------
the on the side of the the cuz there's a

---------12:39----------
little park right in front of the ninth

---------12:41----------
Avenue and 14th Street Apple store I

---------12:43----------
wanted to have a little sign and we were

---------12:47----------
gonna do free board repairs to anybody

---------12:48----------
who showed up during that time period so

---------12:50----------
if you had a MacBook with some liquid

---------12:52----------
damage and it was something where I

---------12:54----------
could fix it then and there we were not

---------12:56----------
going to charge you we were just gonna

---------12:57----------
fix your board tell you what's wrong

---------12:59----------
with it and we wanted to have a little

---------13:00----------
sign that said you know well second

---------13:03----------
opinion asked here and then I figured

---------13:09----------
out that you do need a permit for what

---------13:11----------
it was I was looking to do and it was

---------13:12----------
gonna be think something like three

---------13:13----------
thousand dollars a day and I thought all

---------13:15----------
right game that's what you know I'll do

---------13:17----------
it

---------13:17----------
but this is a once in a lifetime kind of

---------13:20----------
thing so I'll do it so then I called

---------13:22----------
about getting permission for it because

---------13:24----------
it was a different permit needed than

---------13:25----------
the one that I thought I needed and then

---------13:27----------
they put me on hold and then this woman

---------13:29----------
says wait so what's your last name and I

---------13:31----------
said Rossman I think and then I get put

---------13:33----------
on hold they come back from hold and I

---------13:36----------
can hear someone laughing in the

---------13:37----------
background said no no no no no no you

---------13:39----------
can't do that

---------13:40----------
so what I'm imagining happened is that

---------13:42----------
they googled me because that's about the

---------13:43----------
amount of time it takes to google my

---------13:44----------
name and do a little bit of scrolling so

---------13:46----------
I'm guessing what happened is they

---------13:47----------
googled me they know exactly what it was

---------13:49----------
I was looking to do and said yeah no no

---------13:52----------
they can't have it

---------14:01----------
but I thought that would have been

---------14:02----------
really fun this is something that I've

---------14:04----------
really I've always thought would be

---------14:05----------
really fun to do because that's the

---------14:10----------
thing how many people I only see the

---------14:12----------
people that decide after they go to the

---------14:15----------
Apple store and here it's gonna be

---------14:16----------
fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars

---------14:17----------
that then did their due diligence and

---------14:19----------
research and decided to come here but I

---------14:22----------
have no idea how many people go to the

---------14:23----------
Apple store and then just wind up going

---------14:26----------
home and never doing anything but if

---------14:27----------
there was a sign and a little booth

---------14:29----------
outside that said you know second

---------14:30----------
opinion asked here and I had my

---------14:34----------
microscope and my soldering tools and I

---------14:36----------
could show them on a little screen what

---------14:38----------
everything looked like using a

---------14:40----------
microscope camera and all that I'm just

---------14:41----------
kind of curious how that would how that

---------14:43----------
would have turned out you know maybe

---------14:45----------
more people would have an idea that this

---------14:47----------
is indeed a viable option because again

---------14:50----------
I only see the people that do the

---------14:51----------
research to figure out that it is a

---------14:52----------
viable option after the fact don't see

---------14:54----------
the people that you never meet yeah I

---------14:59----------
was gonna some I am kind of curious CSI

---------15:05----------
and outside of an Apple store that said

---------15:07----------
you know need it fixed come here that's

---------15:14----------
it's tempting

---------15:19----------
because on one hand it could be seen as

---------15:21----------
something that's being done in bad taste

---------15:23----------
because they closed due to the pandemic

---------15:25----------
but on the so I could see how someone

---------15:28----------
would say that's the being done and

---------15:29----------
really in really bad taste and how

---------15:33----------
people would then overreact to it and

---------15:35----------
say you're you're mean you're evil you

---------15:37----------
want people you know Apple doesn't want

---------15:40----------
people to die that's why they did that

---------15:42----------
do you want people to die there is

---------15:44----------
that's what people do

---------15:47----------
he politicians can't make the types of

---------15:50----------
advertisements that they do smearing

---------15:52----------
people if people didn't eat it up you

---------15:54----------
know but the reason I think it could be

---------15:58----------
valid in this case is because this is

---------16:00----------
something where I've literally already

---------16:01----------
applied with the city for the ability to

---------16:04----------
do this before anybody 99% of the

---------16:07----------
population knew what a coronaviruses

---------16:27----------
first thing we're gonna do is scrape

---------16:30----------
away at the trace so we have something

---------16:32----------
Assad or two there this is where the

---------16:36----------
chip is going to be creating PP 5vs5 the

---------16:40----------
LDO that's going to happen over here and

---------16:43----------
it goes to that cow now I'm not sure if

---------16:45----------
the pathway that it takes to the other

---------16:47----------
side of the board or any other place

---------16:48----------
that's going happens over here at the

---------16:51----------
point that broke off or over there what

---------16:55----------
about up appealing the rejected street

---------16:57----------
permit I don't think there is an appeals

---------16:59----------
process to that

---------17:04----------
I'm pretty sure there's not but if there

---------17:08----------
was I sincerely doubt I would have time

---------17:10----------
for it I mean as fun as that is to do

---------17:13----------
right now I'm behind as hell on just

---------17:15----------
repairs from my own store I don't know

---------17:17----------
how good it would be to waste time on

---------17:20----------
the appeal so that I can then admittedly

---------17:22----------
waste time doing what is pretty much a

---------17:24----------
troll funs role but

---------17:39----------
okay

---------17:40----------
so now we're gonna get a wire I'm gonna

---------17:43----------
use a little bit of a thicker jumper

---------17:44----------
wire than I usually use here because

---------17:45----------
this is a million power trace

---------18:07----------
3,200 K new cases in New York please

---------18:09----------
wash your hands I don't believe that

---------18:12----------
they're new and I'll explain to you why

---------18:14----------
I don't believe that those cases are new

---------18:15----------
you tell me what you think if you want

---------18:18----------
to get a test in a lot of areas you need

---------18:21----------
to know someone that will tested

---------18:24----------
positive right

---------18:24----------
so you need to know someone that tested

---------18:26----------
positive in order to get a test but that

---------18:30----------
doesn't make sense because there are a

---------18:31----------
lot of people that may be sick that

---------18:33----------
cannot get a test because they need to

---------18:34----------
know someone that has tested positive to

---------18:35----------
get a test so this is a very chicken in

---------18:37----------
the egg scenario so a lot of these

---------18:40----------
people that are testing new it's not

---------18:41----------
that they are newly diagnosed I mean I

---------18:43----------
thought that they newly caught it

---------18:44----------
they're newly diagnosed it so because

---------18:46----------
now the testing kit is actually

---------18:48----------
available so these people may have been

---------18:51----------
sick for a month or two months and it's

---------18:56----------
only now that you're figuring out that

---------18:57----------
they were sick but that's the part

---------19:00----------
that's a real real [ __ ] here is

---------19:02----------
that there are four many people even if

---------19:05----------
they're showing symptoms they're not

---------19:07----------
able to get tested because they don't

---------19:10----------
they can't show that they were in

---------19:12----------
contact with someone that tested

---------19:13----------
positive which to me is just an excuse

---------19:16----------
for the fact that they can't test people

---------19:18----------
I could just be honest and say sorry we

---------19:20----------
don't have any tests sorry we got no

---------19:22----------
tests our medical system is a complete

---------19:26----------
is just total total fail right now no

---------19:29----------
tests instead of putting together these

---------19:32----------
these rules

---------19:33----------
I aim to put Trump stimulus money to use

---------19:39----------
would enjoy a stream of what equipment

---------19:41----------
you sell to do repairs on applications

---------19:43----------
we've best suited for thank you

---------19:45----------
nearly reported / confirmed is what I

---------19:47----------
meant okay yeah I guess I hear what

---------19:49----------
you're saying I'm just saying that

---------19:52----------
because a lot of the news is when they

---------19:55----------
report it they say it like it's these

---------19:58----------
people just got it and that drives me

---------20:00----------
crazy

---------20:06----------
hey man been a bit since I caught a live

---------20:08----------
stream Louis rossmann Apple repair a cat

---------20:10----------
serving and freedom thank you

---------20:16----------
all right got that in there got a nice

---------20:21----------
little jumper you know I have some

---------20:24----------
videos on equipment that I've used in

---------20:26----------
the past but I'm gonna be updating that

---------20:28----------
a little recently since I may be

---------20:30----------
recommending a different hot air station

---------20:32----------
something came out that seems very

---------20:34----------
similar to the quick we're much less

---------20:36----------
money then there are certain other tools

---------20:38----------
that I've used differently but yeah I

---------20:42----------
mean if you're getting any sort of the

---------20:43----------
stimulus money from this put it to it

---------20:46----------
unless you have repair business coming

---------20:49----------
in already I probably put that towards

---------20:51----------
things that are more what's the word I'm

---------20:53----------
looking for more immediately crucial to

---------20:57----------
living your life

---------21:11----------
watching your videos makes me stay at

---------21:13----------
home now you're essential your welcomes

---------21:15----------
has been so I'm hot airing here just to

---------21:20----------
make sure I get the flux in the hot air

---------21:22----------
gets rid of the rest of any corrosion

---------21:23----------
there but also it's gonna make my jumper

---------21:26----------
wire fall into place where it's supposed

---------21:27----------
to be we're gonna take a second look at

---------21:30----------
this at an angle to make sure that

---------21:32----------
everything here is in its right place it

---------21:35----------
looks like those two pads are shorted

---------21:37----------
but it's actually just dirt but don't

---------21:39----------
worry the dirt is gonna come off in the

---------21:40----------
ultrasonic queen now the next thing is

---------21:42----------
I'm kind of curious to see where else on

---------21:43----------
the board this pp5 es5 goes we have to

---------21:49----------
see if it's actually connected so it

---------21:51----------
goes yeah so according to the board view

---------21:54----------
software PP 5 V S 5 is going to go to

---------22:00----------
right over here so now I'm gonna figure

---------22:02----------
out there's still continuity there

---------22:04----------
because remember what I was saying is I

---------22:05----------
don't know if the pathway so PP 5 es 5 I

---------22:08----------
don't know if the pathway to that is

---------22:09----------
from that solder pad over to there or

---------22:13----------
that solder pad that's destroyed over it

---------22:16----------
over there but the only way I'm gonna

---------22:17----------
find out is by beeping with the

---------22:19----------
multimeter by the way everybody just

---------22:20----------
enjoy yourself a nice little bit of

---------22:22----------
motion sickness over there I work for

---------22:25----------
wsv and TV in Miami kinda is my life huh

---------22:30----------
what's WSVN TV with people with the

---------22:35----------
multimeter probes and i'll allowing them

---------22:37----------
to Google at the moment

---------22:41----------
so let's see if this works

---------22:45----------
this does not go BP beep

---------22:54----------
we will be running a second jumper

---------22:56----------
because this is not beeping more

---------22:58----------
importantly for some reason my good

---------23:01----------
friend Paul Daniels the software is

---------23:03----------
showing that I'm in voltage mode rather

---------23:04----------
than resistance mode but yes this is not

---------23:09----------
beeping so PP 5vs5

---------23:11----------
is not making its way to the other

---------23:13----------
section of the board so PP 5vs5 is not

---------23:17----------
just here it's going to this resistor

---------23:20----------
over here and then over there I'm kind

---------23:23----------
of curious if I attach it to here will

---------23:24----------
it also be attached over there let's see

---------23:26----------
one way to find out so let's see which

---------23:28----------
sections of this but let's try this

---------23:31----------
again

---------23:32----------
so PP 5vs5 is gonna be over here and

---------23:37----------
okay this beeps so this this beeps from

---------23:41----------
here to here right but PP 5vs5

---------23:43----------
but this doesn't so the disconnect is

---------23:46----------
between here and there so I can stead of

---------23:48----------
running a wire from here all the way

---------23:50----------
down there I can run a wire from here to

---------23:53----------
here and then PP 5vs5 will show up okay

---------23:55----------
so let's do just that and since that is

---------23:58----------
shorter yeah may be able to get away

---------24:02----------
with a smaller jumper there cuz that's

---------24:05----------
not the main delivery to the rest of the

---------24:08----------
machine actually right no it may be

---------24:16----------
that pad is destroyed looking I don't

---------24:20----------
know how much I trust putting a sick

---------24:22----------
jumper over there

---------24:26----------
all right yeah thick jumper may just rip

---------24:29----------
that right off of the board okay so

---------24:35----------
we'll make do with a higher gauge jumper

---------24:38----------
over here

---------24:41----------
[Applause]

---------25:14----------
I want the wire to remain insulated

---------25:19----------
go around like this

---------25:25----------
and now we arrange this

---------25:33----------
get rid of the excess

---------25:43----------
come on

---------25:45----------
bye-bye

---------26:10----------
and I'm gonna wind up greening this down

---------26:12----------
but it's gonna go better than it did the

---------26:14----------
other night you don't talk about the

---------26:16----------
other night

---------26:22----------
see the main thing is I didn't want that

---------26:24----------
wire going over those three Pro coins on

---------26:26----------
the way over there

---------26:33----------
not great routing for an essential power

---------26:35----------
line this is better all right now after

---------26:39----------
this you're gonna see that it does

---------26:42----------
connect over to the other side another

---------26:45----------
section

---------26:55----------
let's get everything in place there

---------27:09----------
and place and place okay

---------27:18----------
now when I turn on the Paul Daniels

---------27:20----------
software and I go to make a resistance

---------27:22----------
measurement between here

---------27:28----------
see now we have power going through

---------27:30----------
Earth's pasta

---------27:36----------
we've got some junk to clean up over

---------27:38----------
there the ultrasonic queen is gonna get

---------27:40----------
all of that though now watch when this

---------27:45----------
thing gets turned on you're going to see

---------27:47----------
that the fan spins and then it works

---------27:50----------
just fine so I'm going to plug this in

---------27:54----------
and there's a fairly good chance I would

---------27:58----------
say it damn near 99.99999 chance that

---------28:03----------
this takes 500 milliamps and turns on so

---------28:06----------
let's see if that's the case are we

---------28:09----------
essential

---------28:19----------
and we are not essential

---------28:34----------
Oh non-essential service um all right

---------28:42----------
well as PP 5v as five present yeah it is

---------28:51----------
nice and stable is PP 3v3 s5 present

---------29:10----------
point one volts o PP 3 V 3 S 5 is not

---------29:17----------
present now is it not present because

---------29:19----------
it's not being enabled or is it not

---------29:22----------
present because there's a short circuit

---------29:25----------
to ground because the CPU died when the

---------29:27----------
u7 501 send 12 volts to the CPU want me

---------29:31----------
to find out

---------29:32----------
so P P 3 V 3 s 5 enable is gonna be on

---------29:36----------
pinch 1 D 1 of our u7 501 known as 4th

---------29:41----------
pinned from the bottom on the left side

---------29:50----------
and the enables there alright now we

---------29:54----------
figure out if P P 3 V 3 s 5 is short at

---------29:58----------
the ground and if it is that's gonna be

---------30:01----------
a big ouch for our board and for our

---------30:05----------
customer 277 ohms

---------30:13----------
that's not broken if for a low voltage

---------30:16----------
rail that is not shorted if this was a

---------30:19----------
12 volt rail yes but on a 3.3 volt line

---------30:21----------
particularly one that's gonna be going

---------30:23----------
to the CPU that is not short-circuited

---------30:25----------
we're missing something simple here so

---------30:29----------
we have some more corroded probe points

---------30:31----------
and I'm wondering this one has a

---------30:33----------
complete hole in it

---------30:35----------
what are you for your p5 vs 3v BST ok oh

---------30:43----------
that's where this is gonna go to this so

---------30:46----------
you don't really need that now do you

---------30:49----------
cuz it's not going to the other side of

---------30:51----------
the board or anything wait a second I

---------30:54----------
put that wire to the wrong nub son of

---------30:57----------
a--

---------31:02----------
Tisa oh man I'm dumb

---------31:13----------
we pretend I didn't do that can we

---------31:17----------
pretend I didn't just do that all right

---------31:19----------
let's see what happens now em alright

---------31:27----------
here we go come on give me 500 milliamps

---------31:32----------
so go past indeed I did something really

---------31:37----------
stupid now is [ __ ] dumb right so take

---------31:41----------
a look before the we show that this

---------31:44----------
works so on pin 2 that is actually skip

---------31:48----------
select so I what I did is I sent 5 volts

---------31:51----------
to skip select and skip select is

---------31:54----------
probably gonna skip something like with

---------31:56----------
the part where the computer works and it

---------31:58----------
turns on and the customer is happy you

---------32:00----------
don't want to skip that you don't want

---------32:01----------
to skip that I was what I was doing is

---------32:04----------
pp 5 es 5 shows up here the chip makes

---------32:09----------
PP 5 es 5 on pin 29 right it goes to

---------32:13----------
that capacitor from that capacitor it

---------32:15----------
goes here and from there it goes to this

---------32:17----------
other section of the board now the

---------32:19----------
connection between that capacitor in

---------32:20----------
here was broken as was the connection

---------32:22----------
between that capacitor and there so this

---------32:25----------
was beeping here but it wasn't beeping

---------32:27----------
me here so I needed to reattach this to

---------32:31----------
this because this wasn't beeping to

---------32:32----------
there so I reattached this but I sent 5

---------32:36----------
volts here instead of sending 5 volts

---------32:38----------
there

---------32:39----------
whoopsie-daisy anyway I'll show you it

---------32:43----------
says it's fine it'll work just fine

---------32:45----------
it'll work just fine you know why this

---------32:47----------
is happening because this particular

---------32:49----------
customer asked so how do you do it I'm

---------32:52----------
kind of curious how do you how does this

---------32:53----------
work and I said oh I'll send you a video

---------32:55----------
of it when it's done don't worry you'll

---------32:57----------
get to see how everything is done yeah

---------32:58----------
you can watch the whole process and now

---------33:01----------
they're gonna see me sending 5 volts to

---------33:02----------
random [ __ ] and we can edit that out

---------33:05----------
that's the power of editing is for it

---------33:07----------
that's what editing is for my friends

---------33:11----------
nobody has to see that this is what we

---------33:14----------
call editing you don't have to look like

---------33:17----------
a dumbass you just add it selectively we

---------33:23----------
don't make mistakes we edit

---------33:25----------
all right the boot

---------33:35----------
Apple logo bada bing cover this so that

---------33:39----------
you can't see the person's name

---------33:42----------
maybe boots low because I don't have the

---------33:44----------
right i/o board plugged in it has booted

---------33:48----------
all right so a lot of you like to see

---------33:50----------
what the board looks like after

---------33:51----------
ultrasonic cleaning and here it is my a

---------33:57----------
happy wire over here and I have much it

---------34:01----------
so this is what it looks like when it's

---------34:03----------
all done

---------34:06----------
isn't that pretty

---------34:08----------
it's nice isn't it yeah that's my phone

---------34:17----------
all right so we're gonna put a little

---------34:20----------
bit of green stuff check it out this is

---------34:24----------
what it looks like after the ultrasonic

---------34:26----------
cleaner we just put some of the uvh 900

---------34:30----------
UV mask on the board that we sell at

---------34:31----------
store across from group comm keep that

---------34:34----------
area with that wire nice and safe and

---------34:36----------
now I'm going over it with that UV pen

---------34:38----------
and when I go over with the pen it's

---------34:42----------
going on hardened that green stuff over

---------34:44----------
the wire and protect it the wire was

---------34:46----------
already covered in enamel but I didn't

---------34:48----------
want the wire to make a straight line to

---------34:49----------
its point so I'm routing around which is

---------34:56----------
why we have this green stuff here now

---------34:59----------
you'll see that it's the wire itself is

---------35:04----------
encapsulated and protected

---------35:14----------
you put a little bit more right on the

---------35:16----------
end

---------35:27----------
because that wire is very small and

---------35:30----------
sensitive

---------35:40----------
you cure it on there

---------36:19----------
hard as ice

---------36:24----------
it's nice and protected that's it for

---------36:27----------
today as always I hope you learned

---------36:29----------
something I'll see you in the next video

---------36:31----------
bye now
