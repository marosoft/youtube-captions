---------00:00----------
all right so today we're working on a

---------00:02----------
3115 board that has no brain or

---------00:06----------
technical term I guess no CPU which

---------00:08----------
means you turn it on you just get a

---------00:10----------
black screen very often happens after

---------00:12----------
liquid damage and for some reason 31:15

---------00:16----------
no V port is more common than with

---------00:18----------
almost every other Apple board so the

---------00:20----------
first thing I do if I turn it on I get

---------00:22----------
no brain as I measure the vcore right

---------00:25----------
here right come on there we go see okay

---------00:36----------
it says this one or this one I forget

---------00:38----------
you'll see you'll feel figure it out

---------00:40----------
you know when you get zero on money

---------00:41----------
anyway if you have zero volts on both of

---------00:43----------
them then you you're obviously

---------00:45----------
you're supposed to get between five to

---------00:47----------
eight hundred millivolts depending on

---------00:48----------
what your computer is doing at the time

---------00:52----------
the other power rails for the CPU are

---------00:54----------
fairly stable and usually always work

---------00:56----------
it's just that one it's troublesome

---------00:59----------
that's PPV core Esso CPU right now this

---------01:06----------
chip over here is the one that controls

---------01:08----------
so let's look up here at the screen

---------01:12----------
okay page up let's try that again

---------01:17----------
a job all right so

---------01:22----------
that is this

---------01:24----------
this is responsible for a lot of

---------01:26----------
different things but one of the main

---------01:27----------
things it's responsible for that gets

---------01:29----------
 up very easily is operating this

---------01:32----------
set of transistors here that turn 12

---------01:36----------
volts which comes in up here into one

---------01:40----------
volt which comes to down here eight

---------01:42----------
hundred millivolts 900 millivolts 1.2

---------01:45----------
volts see it depends on what the machine

---------01:47----------
is doing and also the CPU I honestly

---------01:49----------
don't even remember the exact voltage

---------01:50----------
off the top of my head because all the

---------01:51----------
different years use different voltages

---------01:53----------
and I've never had a case of it being

---------01:55----------
tiny bit too much or a tiny bit too low

---------01:57----------
I only ever have a case of it either

---------01:58----------
it's there and it works or it's not

---------02:01----------
there and it's so to be honest

---------02:02----------
with you I don't remember the exact

---------02:04----------
voltage unit to be a hundred percent

---------02:05----------
honest with you I frankly don't really

---------02:07----------
care what it is I just care that it's

---------02:08----------
there yeah so this is a transistor this

---------02:14----------
is actually

---------02:24----------
this isn't this is actually a couple of

---------02:27----------
transistors in one this thing right over

---------02:29----------
here let's take a look on the screen so

---------02:35----------
you have 12 volts coming in through here

---------02:37----------
comes in here and now this is ground so

---------02:41----------
what does this look like to you remember

---------02:42----------
what we talked about voltage dividers in

---------02:44----------
the earlier videos what a voltage

---------02:45----------
divider does how it works so what do you

---------02:49----------
see hopefully you starting to see a

---------02:50----------
pattern here in terms of voltage

---------02:52----------
dividers so this is where the power

---------02:54----------
comes in this is the first resistor

---------02:57----------
because as I told you a transistor is a

---------02:59----------
variable resistor it's nothing more than

---------03:01----------
a resistor whose resistance changes

---------03:03----------
based on an input signal so this is one

---------03:07----------
resistor whose resistance changes based

---------03:09----------
on input signal see you gate one and

---------03:13----------
this is another resistor whose

---------03:15----------
resistance changes based on input signal

---------03:18----------
see L gate 1 so you have one gate and

---------03:23----------
another gate voltage so these are

---------03:24----------
actually two transistors that are being

---------03:26----------
used in a voltage divider now what I

---------03:28----------
told you a voltage divider does a

---------03:29----------
voltage divider takes a higher voltage

---------03:32----------
and turns it into a lower voltage by

---------03:34----------
having one resistor go between the

---------03:35----------
higher voltage which is the 12 volts up

---------03:37----------
here it's going between the higher

---------03:39----------
voltage and where you want it to power

---------03:41----------
to go and then from what you want the

---------03:43----------
power to go to ground you'll have

---------03:44----------
another resistor and the value of those

---------03:46----------
resistors is what will create your end

---------03:48----------
voltage so here you're starting with 12

---------03:51----------
here's ground and over here you won't

---------03:53----------
have a voltage of something like 1 and

---------03:55----------
that's what happens between these two so

---------03:58----------
what I'll often check is whether there's

---------04:00----------
an input signal going to the L gate and

---------04:02----------
you get again most of the time this 12

---------04:04----------
volts here is totally fine this is

---------04:07----------
virtually never shorting the ground this

---------04:08----------
plug of this transistor good good good

---------04:10----------
luck killing this thing look look at a

---------04:12----------
 huge it is that that's a monster

---------04:15----------
so what usually happens is that little

---------04:17----------
max chip I'm going

---------04:19----------
point out - in a minute and doesn't put

---------04:21----------
out these two signals so these signals

---------04:23----------
are what you need to open this so that

---------04:25----------
this actually starts working so you

---------04:27----------
open this transistor and open this

---------04:28----------
transistor as I said it's two

---------04:30----------
transistors in one package and if those

---------04:32----------
two don't open you're kind of so

---------04:34----------
on this board looked up here that's not

---------04:42----------
really this okay so this is that chip

---------04:45----------
that I showed you on the previous page

---------04:47----------
earlier and when you look really closely

---------04:50----------
you may find a hint let's see if you see

---------04:53----------
the hint as to what doesn't work see

---------04:58----------
yeah there's a red thing over there now

---------05:00----------
there was a red thing over here but it's

---------05:03----------
now covered by solder a lot of these

---------05:05----------
liquid damaged boards you're going to

---------05:06----------
see little points that are red then all

---------05:07----------
these little points in the board when I

---------05:09----------
say points that means of those circles

---------05:10----------
these are called probe points now probe

---------05:13----------
points are points that correspond to a

---------05:16----------
lead on a chip or lead on any one of

---------05:19----------
these components here where you can

---------05:20----------
actually go and measure and any time the

---------05:22----------
board gets liquid damage or power goes

---------05:23----------
where it's not supposed to you'll see

---------05:25----------
these turn red or they'll just be blown

---------05:27----------
off the board completely so there was a

---------05:32----------
huge red probe point right leading to

---------05:35----------
this resistor here and I'll show you

---------05:37----------
what the resistor is I'm somatic I

---------05:40----------
decided to measure that resistor and

---------05:42----------
when I measured that resistor instead of

---------05:44----------
getting the 150 kilometres no not what

---------05:54----------
I'm looking for you Oh

---------05:58----------
now and I did measure that I instead of

---------06:01----------
getting the 150 kilo ohms that I was

---------06:03----------
supposed to get I was getting something

---------06:04----------
like infinity ohms which which is no

---------06:07----------
good so this here is PPV this is the is

---------06:12----------
the resistor right here now this was

---------06:14----------
going from the 12 volts that powers that

---------06:17----------
transistor that eventually powers the

---------06:18----------
CPU to this pin CPU in Tona honestly I

---------06:24----------
don't know what that does I'd have to

---------06:26----------
find the datasheet for the chip to see

---------06:27----------
what that does I don't know what it does

---------06:28----------
and I did I care to look it up

---------06:31----------
No did I decide to take a class to

---------06:33----------
figure out what it does not really and

---------06:34----------
it says that the resist is supposed to

---------06:36----------
be 150 kilo ohms I measured it it's

---------06:38----------
infinity I took a resistor off of

---------06:40----------
another motherboard I put it there and

---------06:42----------
now when I turn it on I'll show you what

---------06:45----------
I get again a lot of the a lot of the

---------06:47----------
times people go how do you know all this

---------06:49----------
way to learn all this woody like what am

---------06:51----------
I supposed to know what all this means

---------06:53----------
and do you really want to know all the

---------06:55----------
means do you really want to know every

---------06:57----------
single word and the schematic means do

---------06:59----------
you want to just simply get a basic

---------07:02----------
understanding of it and use your brain

---------07:04----------
just enough that you can turn a 17 cent

---------07:07----------
resistor into two to $400

---------07:09----------
me personally I chose ii again it's

---------07:12----------
great if I can learn what all that is

---------07:14----------
it's really great if I can learn every

---------07:17----------
single fab you know every single exact

---------07:19----------
thing but again I am aiming to learn

---------07:24----------
enough that I can get paid and I

---------07:28----------
realized realistically that I would

---------07:30----------
probably have to spend a lot of time in

---------07:32----------
college good six seven eight

---------07:36----------
years to know exactly what every single

---------07:38----------
one of those things mean just by looking

---------07:39----------
at it and part of what makes this so

---------07:42----------
unmanageable for so many people is that

---------07:44----------
they think they actually have to know

---------07:46----------
what all that means and

---------07:47----------
well himself with all this information

---------07:49----------
is if they need to know if all that

---------07:50----------
means in order to do something that's

---------07:53----------
not how it works you should just break

---------07:54----------
it down into the simple into something

---------07:56----------
more simplistic something more

---------07:58----------
manageable that you can understand and

---------07:59----------
when you do that it becomes easier and

---------08:02----------
then you actually do get a chance to

---------08:05----------
learn everything as you go you do get a

---------08:07----------
chance to learn each step of the way

---------08:08----------
because they're trying to learn

---------08:09----------
everything at once you're learning

---------08:12----------
exactly what you need to learn and as

---------08:14----------
you go you've learned the last thing

---------08:16----------
because you figured it out on your own

---------08:17----------
and you know it slowly becomes

---------08:19----------
manageable to slowly become something

---------08:21----------
that you can feasibly do well you got to

---------08:25----------
do is use your brain yeah

---------08:51----------
one of the heatsink gone but this is a

---------08:53----------
has well so I can keep this on for quite

---------08:56----------
a good amount of time before anything

---------08:57----------
that even begins to happen I'm not going

---------09:01----------
to keep it on the wrong I'm just going

---------09:02----------
to keep it on long enough to figure out

---------09:05----------
which one of these Pro points you touch

---------09:06----------
to get Zeke or

---------09:12----------
here we go

---------09:22----------
all right so as you can see

---------09:28----------
got moving for

---------09:36----------
let me show you what probe point I'm

---------09:37----------
touching

---------09:42----------
yeah if you turn it on and has no brain

---------09:44----------
check there yeah this is different for a

---------09:48----------
motherboard and your problem may not be

---------09:50----------
the same as mine you may have a totally

---------09:52----------
different problem

---------09:52----------
big caused by something else altogether

---------09:55----------
the last one that I had to work on that

---------09:56----------
had no brain no CPU I was actually a

---------10:00----------
little easier because there was a bunch

---------10:02----------
of red crap right here and this pro

---------10:04----------
point was very very red I'm not looking

---------10:08----------
at the right thing no here we go

---------10:10----------
so this probe point here was very red

---------10:16----------
and it just gave me a hint

---------10:17----------
and I thought huh now you measure that

---------10:19----------
and then I looked up what it was on here

---------10:22----------
then I looked up what it was supposed to

---------10:23----------
be and then I noticed I wasn't getting

---------10:25----------
anything and it just followed along and

---------10:26----------
I eventually replaced to this I see on

---------10:29----------
this why I just refloat the solder

---------10:30----------
around it because this was actually a

---------10:32----------
fine chick that just had nasty looking

---------10:33----------
solder but on the other one I actually

---------10:36----------
had to replace this thing but yeah

---------10:38----------
that's that's pretty much it you know

---------10:40----------
not an exciting board no wires it was

---------10:43----------
fairly quick and simple
