---------00:00----------
hi today I'm gonna be going over the one

---------00:02----------
wire circuit on an older MacBook Pro

---------00:04----------
because on these machines it's a little

---------00:06----------
bit more confusing than what it was on

---------00:08----------
the newer MacBook Pros now this is

---------00:11----------
something that I wanted to do in real

---------00:12----------
time it's been something that's been

---------00:14----------
getting asked a lot and I wanted to go

---------00:16----------
over it in a repair video today and some

---------00:20----------
of my repair videos lately have kind of

---------00:21----------
been going like and this one really

---------00:24----------
took the cake like I say that I post

---------00:26----------
everything I post even when I screw up

---------00:28----------
and this I have this repair actually

---------00:29----------
worked everything came out well but

---------00:31----------
there's kind of a limit to how dumb I'll

---------00:33----------
allow myself to look on camera and today

---------00:36----------
I definitely managed to reach that limit

---------00:38----------
with this video so I'm not gonna be

---------00:40----------
doing this in real time but I am going

---------00:42----------
to walk you through it and it's gonna be

---------00:45----------
again it's gonna be after the fact so

---------00:46----------
it's gonna be a little lame compared to

---------00:48----------
one that's done in real time but

---------00:50----------
hopefully it winds up being something

---------00:52----------
that's somewhat informative that you can

---------00:53----------
use and you know kind of learn something

---------00:56----------
from so I'm gonna open up a schematic

---------00:58----------
for one of the newer model machines here

---------00:59----------
because with the newer model machines

---------01:01----------
you're it's a little bit easier to

---------01:03----------
understand how the one wire circuit

---------01:05----------
works compared to the older one so once

---------01:07----------
you understand the newer one

---------01:08----------
understanding the older one will become

---------01:10----------
a little easier but if you don't

---------01:11----------
understand the newer one or the older

---------01:13----------
one then it's gonna be a little bit

---------01:14----------
confusing all around so that said let's

---------01:19----------
get over to discussing that part of it

---------01:21----------
so let's move over to the screen capture

---------01:24----------
here so we're gonna go over to the

---------01:26----------
screen capture here is that screen

---------01:29----------
capture are we in screen capture oh this

---------01:33----------
is this is this is not screen capture

---------01:39----------
hmm we're getting close Oh capturing the

---------01:45----------
wrong screen there we go

---------01:48----------
I know I just got a shrink me no need

---------01:50----------
for me to be big yeah you can go away

---------01:53----------
 go down here there we go

---------01:56----------
fine go away all right so that being

---------02:00----------
said hi kitty

---------02:08----------
good kitty alright so we're going to go

---------02:11----------
over to the 1y circuit so this is pretty

---------02:29----------
simple the whole idea here is that the

---------02:31----------
one wire circuit is going to allow the

---------02:33----------
adapter see here it says MagSafe DC jack

---------02:35----------
it's going to allow the adapter to talk

---------02:38----------
to the SMC so the adapter has 18 volts

---------02:41----------
you know DC electricity duh it has

---------02:44----------
ground again duh required for a circuit

---------02:46----------
but the one that confuses people is

---------02:48----------
adapter sense adapter sense since the

---------02:51----------
adapter turn-on so that is going to go

---------02:53----------
over to this I see this I see over here

---------02:56----------
has X and int now let's think about this

---------03:02----------
year X as an external as in the charger

---------03:05----------
and then int as an internal meaning and

---------03:10----------
newer versions of open broadcast would

---------03:12----------
have this slow Mouse on both of my

---------03:14----------
computers I'm telling you and you find

---------03:16----------
good software and it's not software that

---------03:18----------
connects to the internet or can have

---------03:19----------
security vulnerabilities don't

---------03:22----------
update this never dated anyway so we

---------03:25----------
have sis one wire is gonna be internal

---------03:27----------
this is the going to be for the SMC oh

---------03:31----------
thank you for making me deaf so the SM

---------03:35----------
see here see sis one wire it says by for

---------03:40----------
bi-directional data line that is the SMC

---------03:47----------
over here it's gonna say in the bottom

---------03:48----------
right corner of the schematic here see

---------03:50----------
it says SMC so this IC is going to allow

---------03:56----------
the SMC to talk to the charger and

---------03:59----------
that's how you get your green light on

---------04:00----------
your Mac safe charge now this IC has

---------04:03----------
another pin VCC VCC VDD V in are pretty

---------04:07----------
much the same when it comes to

---------04:08----------
these schematics it's just the power pin

---------04:11----------
that's required to turn it on so you

---------04:13----------
know like like this shitty little

---------04:15----------
interface that I have it has a cable

---------04:17----------
going into it you can think of this

---------04:18----------
cable as the VC

---------04:20----------
beep in if I don't plug that in it

---------04:22----------
doesn't get power so this trip over here

---------04:24----------
as a VCC pin that's where you apply 3.42

---------04:26----------
volts when you want it to turn on

---------04:28----------
now it's 3.42 volts it's going to come

---------04:31----------
from this IC over here this is a logic

---------04:33----------
gate this logic gate is going to take PP

---------04:36----------
3 V 4 2 which is 3 point 42 volts and

---------04:39----------
it's going to pass it on to this chip

---------04:42----------
which is going to allow the charger to

---------04:43----------
talk to the SMC it's going to do that if

---------04:46----------
smc bc AC ok is present so let's find s

---------04:49----------
MC bc AC ok in this command now this

---------04:52----------
over here again this is where a little

---------04:54----------
bit of common sense is required in

---------04:55----------
charger AC okay little equal sign

---------04:58----------
hamburger looking thing and then sm c bc

---------05:01----------
AC okay so what this is telling me is

---------05:03----------
that for the rest of the schematic

---------05:05----------
charger AC ok is going to be used

---------05:07----------
instead of SMC bcs you okay and that's

---------05:10----------
fine now this is you 7000 this is what's

---------05:14----------
going to take charger voltage this is a

---------05:16----------
buck convert if you don't know what a

---------05:17----------
buck converter is watch the buck

---------05:18----------
converter videos this is going to take

---------05:21----------
the 16 or 18 volt from the charger and

---------05:23----------
turn it into 12 point 6 volts for the

---------05:25----------
machine now this chip is what's going to

---------05:27----------
shoot out charger AC ok now it's not

---------05:30----------
gonna shoot out charger AC ok unless it

---------05:32----------
gets 4 volts on the charger AC and pin

---------05:35----------
right so make sure you make sure you're

---------05:37----------
following here so you have from adapter

---------05:39----------
that's the 16 or 18 volts from your

---------05:40----------
charger it's going to come through here

---------05:42----------
and in this voltage divider if you don't

---------05:44----------
know what a voltage divider is check my

---------05:45----------
videos and what a voltage divider is are

---------05:47----------
is going to take are this wrote the

---------05:49----------
divider of our 70 10 and our 70 11 are

---------05:51----------
going to take these 16 volts extend it

---------05:54----------
hit the 16 volts from the charger and

---------05:55----------
it's going to turn that 16 volts in the

---------05:57----------
charger into 4 volts for the charger AC

---------05:59----------
in pin now once it gets 4 volts in the

---------06:02----------
charger AC in pin if the chip itself is

---------06:05----------
not and it is also getting power

---------06:07----------
on the charge of DC n pin check r700 5

---------06:10----------
because in the case of a knockoff

---------06:11----------
charger it's always gonna be blown and

---------06:13----------
then it won't shoot out charger AC ok

---------06:16----------
but if it's getting its 16 or 18 volts

---------06:18----------
on charge of DC n if it's getting its 4

---------06:20----------
volts in charger AC and it will shoot

---------06:22----------
out charger AC ok which is sm c bc AC

---------06:26----------
okay i can really type today here we go

---------06:29----------
which will allow this logic 8 to pass

---------06:31----------
3.42 volts onto

---------06:33----------
chip once this chip gets his 3.42 volts

---------06:36----------
it allows the adapter again this is this

---------06:38----------
is the charging port over here it allows

---------06:39----------
the adapter this adapter sense line to

---------06:41----------
talk to the SMC

---------06:44----------
that's the newer one wire circuit simple

---------06:47----------
easy breezy beautiful covergirl I have

---------06:51----------
that stuck in my head I don't know why I

---------06:52----------
remember watching cartoons as a kid and

---------06:54----------
there was a commercial and we'll go easy

---------06:56----------
breezy beautiful kapa haka I even heard

---------06:59----------
that chance it's like 1999 and today

---------07:02----------
just in the middle of nowhere like 4:30

---------07:03----------
in the middle of the day I just hear

---------07:05----------
that in my head like five times

---------07:07----------
it's driving me crazy

---------07:08----------
anyway that's probably one of my videos

---------07:11----------
when right today so let's go over to an

---------07:13----------
older one wire circuit now the reason I

---------07:15----------
bring this up I know people are gonna

---------07:16----------
say why the should we care about

---------07:18----------
this this is from 2009 firstly this is

---------07:21----------
for a 17-inch MacBook Pro now a lot of

---------07:25----------
people like the 17-inch MacBook Pro they

---------07:27----------
don't want to move on so they you know

---------07:28----------
they don't want to try something new

---------07:31----------
they want to stick with what works and

---------07:34----------
they like this device for whatever

---------07:36----------
reason so they're no they're not buying

---------07:38----------
a new one so there is some value in

---------07:40----------
fixing these and the second thing I want

---------07:41----------
you to understand is that a lot of

---------07:42----------
people who watch these videos are not

---------07:44----------
from the United States in the United

---------07:46----------
States you know you're one thousand

---------07:47----------
dollar device dies you buy a fifteen

---------07:49----------
hundred dollar one next week in other

---------07:51----------
countries you know people you spend a

---------07:53----------
one or two three spend two thousand

---------07:54----------
bucks on this thing you expect it to

---------07:55----------
last for the next ten or fifteen years

---------07:57----------
it's just the way it is so a lot of

---------07:59----------
people will still bring these so I want

---------08:00----------
to talk a little bit about how this

---------08:02----------
circuit works and I want to bring up

---------08:04----------
some of the flaws and how Apple drew the

---------08:06----------
schematic because I think a lot of the

---------08:08----------
misunderstanding of this circuit is not

---------08:10----------
necessarily from the fact that it's more

---------08:12----------
complicated it's rather from the fact

---------08:14----------
that the way Apple draws the schematic

---------08:16----------
is fundamentally up and confusing

---------08:17----------
to a lot of people so let's go over that

---------08:20----------
so everything else in this circuit is

---------08:23----------
the same so when it comes to charger AC

---------08:25----------
in charger AC n over here a my insulin

---------08:29----------
surveillance tool in sumantra charger AC

---------08:31----------
and you still have the voltage divider

---------08:32----------
here you seven thousand is still going

---------08:35----------
to shoot out charger AC okay all that

---------08:37----------
stuff is still true that stuff is still

---------08:41----------
the same but when you get to the SMC BC

---------08:43----------
AC okay area that you really get to the

---------08:46----------
to the confusing part so let's yeah

---------08:51----------
so this yeah this is that this is a head

---------08:55----------
this is a mouthful for most people this

---------08:57----------
is a bit of a so let's go

---------08:59----------
over it now let's break it down adapter

---------09:02----------
sense right same adapter sense line over

---------09:05----------
here you have your adapter sense line

---------09:06----------
your adapter sense line is going over to

---------09:09----------
this transistor and then this other

---------09:12----------
transistor which is going to allow it to

---------09:14----------
talk to the SMC right now remember that

---------09:20----------
this is a data line and like mo all data

---------09:22----------
lines well and that are made this way

---------09:24----------
it's going to have to be pulled up by a

---------09:26----------
pull-up resistor if you don't understand

---------09:27----------
how that works check out my video on how

---------09:29----------
a pull up resistor creates a data line

---------09:31----------
take a look over here

---------09:32----------
see this over here this is the the new 1

---------09:34----------
1 wire circuit even after this chip

---------09:37----------
allows the external adapter sense to

---------09:39----------
talk to the internal which is the SMC

---------09:40----------
you still have this resistor over here

---------09:43----------
this pull-up resistor between the three

---------09:44----------
point 42 volts of the VCC pin and since

---------09:47----------
one wire so that there can actually be a

---------09:48----------
data line now take a look over here at

---------09:51----------
this one wire circuit let's check it out

---------09:53----------
let's check out what goes on here so SM

---------09:55----------
CBC a CLK comes through this resistor

---------09:58----------
and it's going to now this over here is

---------10:00----------
an n-channel MOSFET so this is going to

---------10:03----------
allow the power to flow between source

---------10:04----------
and drain

---------10:05----------
if the voltage in the gate is

---------10:06----------
considerably greater than the voltage in

---------10:08----------
the source now if we look at the voltage

---------10:10----------
on the source over here you're going to

---------10:12----------
notice if I actually get my head

---------10:14----------
out of the way you'll see that the

---------10:15----------
source is going to ground ground is 0

---------10:18----------
volts which means that if I put

---------10:20----------
virtually anything on the gate this is

---------10:22----------
going to open and it's going to allow

---------10:24----------
power through

---------10:24----------
so if sm c bc AC okay is present if u

---------10:28----------
7000 says everything's good then at that

---------10:31----------
point

---------10:32----------
this will allow whatever's on the other

---------10:34----------
ends whatever on the drain to go to

---------10:36----------
ground now I want you to take a look up

---------10:38----------
here this over here is a p-channel

---------10:40----------
mosfet by the way if you don't know how

---------10:41----------
to tell if it's an N or a p-channel or

---------10:43----------
you don't know what they do you can

---------10:44----------
watch my videos on transistors and you

---------10:47----------
can also check in just google this

---------10:49----------
little number here and it will tell you

---------10:50----------
this up here is a p-channel MOSFET this

---------10:53----------
works a little bit differently the N

---------10:55----------
channel MOSFET is going to let the

---------10:57----------
power through when the voltage on the

---------10:58----------
gate is higher than the source the

---------11:00----------
p-channel MOSFET is going to let volt

---------11:02----------
that you know it's going to let

---------11:03----------
everything through if the resistance is

---------11:05----------
going to go down when the voltage on the

---------11:07----------
gate is considerably lower than what's

---------11:09----------
on the source so let's look at it like

---------11:11----------
this let me just make it a little let me

---------11:15----------
just make it simple by minimizing what

---------11:17----------
it is you see on the screen here we go

---------11:22----------
okay so we have 18 volts up here 18

---------11:25----------
volts up here going on the source of the

---------11:27----------
transistor and then we have a resistor R

---------11:30----------
69 11 which is going to take that 18

---------11:33----------
volts that's on the source and it's

---------11:35----------
gonna place it on the gate now knowing

---------11:37----------
that with a p-channel that the voltage

---------11:38----------
on the gate has to be lower than the

---------11:40----------
voltage on the source in order for it to

---------11:42----------
open

---------11:42----------
what our 6911 is doing is it's pretty

---------11:44----------
much ensuring that this transistor is

---------11:46----------
constantly in a in a mode of high

---------11:48----------
resistance it's not letting power

---------11:50----------
through right so let's check out over

---------11:53----------
here now what our 69 12 does is it then

---------11:56----------
turns this into a voltage divider stop

---------11:59----------
 with the recycling clinton

---------12:07----------
sometimes you gotta put your foot down

---------12:09----------
over here this is pretty much taking the

---------12:12----------
18 volts in the source and putting it on

---------12:14----------
the gate with which with a p-channel

---------12:15----------
MOSFET the source voltage equals the

---------12:17----------
gate voltage with this particular MOSFET

---------12:19----------
it's going to be in a high impedance

---------12:21----------
mode it's not gonna let power through

---------12:22----------
now what we do over here with our 69 12

---------12:25----------
now this is a voltage divider it's not

---------12:28----------
just one resistor with this resistor

---------12:30----------
over here if we give this resistor R 69

---------12:32----------
12 a path to ground that then becomes a

---------12:34----------
voltage divider so rather than 18 volts

---------12:36----------
being put from the source to the gate

---------12:38----------
now that 18 volts is going from the

---------12:40----------
source to the gate but then our 69 12 if

---------12:42----------
we give it a path to ground

---------12:44----------
well then lower this to maybe 9 volts or

---------12:46----------
7 volts or 11 volts or something like

---------12:49----------
that I don't remember the exact voltage

---------12:50----------
it's not like I work on on relics and

---------12:53----------
antiques every day but every now and

---------12:55----------
then I do so if this opens if this

---------12:58----------
transistor is allowed to open then it

---------13:00----------
will make this into a voltage divider if

---------13:02----------
our 69 12 gets a path to ground and

---------13:05----------
turns us into a voltage divider then the

---------13:07----------
voltage on the gate here is going to be

---------13:08----------
lower than the voltage

---------13:10----------
source if the voltage in the gate is

---------13:12----------
lower than the voltage on the source

---------13:13----------
then this entire circuit will open which

---------13:17----------
will allow 18 volts through here now

---------13:20----------
let's take a look at what happens when

---------13:22----------
you allow 18 volts through here

---------13:23----------
stop with my recycling can kitty

---------13:26----------
oh let's see

---------13:34----------
I know cat I know Clinton you're a mad

---------13:51----------
kitty it's okay okay what type of

---------14:00----------
transistor II you are an n-channel I

---------14:09----------
know you could have told me that right

---------14:12----------
mr. Clinton so my other monitor froze

---------14:20----------
boo oh well that's what happens when you

---------14:25----------
use a dead video card in your recording

---------14:26----------
computer so this is going to open when

---------14:29----------
the voltage on the gate is higher than

---------14:31----------
the voltage that's on either the source

---------14:33----------
of the drain either should I forget my

---------14:34----------
brain is fried

---------14:35----------
anyway 18 volts is gonna be higher than

---------14:37----------
what's on any of that so it's going to

---------14:39----------
allow these two these to open so you

---------14:42----------
would need the voltage to go from the

---------14:44----------
source of the drain here in order for

---------14:46----------
this stuff to open and you also need

---------14:48----------
that for the rest of what's going on

---------14:49----------
here to work so let's take a look at

---------14:51----------
what's going on over here and let's also

---------14:53----------
take a look at what makes this system so

---------14:56----------
confusing now a couple of things that

---------14:58----------
make the system confusing is the fact

---------15:00----------
that Apple has completely failed

---------15:02----------
and I mean completely failed at

---------15:04----------
making any of this make any sense so

---------15:09----------
how's it going little kitten

---------15:12----------
so if we go over here to the board view

---------15:15----------
first things first is where the hell is

---------15:17----------
our 69 18 spin to going to where does

---------15:20----------
this line going I see pin - I don't see

---------15:23----------
a

---------15:23----------
anywhere let's see our 69 18 on the

---------15:27----------
board view then we're gonna check out

---------15:29----------
pintu and see where that's going so pin

---------15:31----------
1 is 1 wire en and pin 2 is grounds ok

---------15:36----------
so pin 2 over here is going to be ground

---------15:42----------
now second thing to get here is on cue

---------15:51----------
69 15 where is pin 4 going i see the

---------15:54----------
drain of this is one wire enable where's

---------15:56----------
the source let's take a look at Q 69 15

---------16:00----------
pin 4 pin 4 is also ground ok this is

---------16:13----------
making some sense now

---------16:14----------
so the voltage on the gate over here

---------16:16----------
you're probably not going to want that

---------16:18----------
to be 18 volts it's it's because that's

---------16:21----------
pretty much gonna say okay even if

---------16:23----------
adapter sense is

---------16:25----------
send 18 okay let's say the DCM board

---------16:27----------
dies right adapter sense should be like

---------16:29----------
three three three and a half volts if

---------16:30----------
the DCN board is or something is

---------16:33----------
 with the system adapter sense can

---------16:35----------
go up to sixteen you don't want adapt

---------16:36----------
you don't want 16 volts going to the SMC

---------16:38----------
on sis 1 wire that's very very bad that

---------16:40----------
will kill the SMC so this will pretty

---------16:44----------
much not allow the adapter sense line

---------16:46----------
through if it goes over a certain

---------16:47----------
voltage and so this is a voltage divider

---------16:50----------
over here that's probably gonna lower it

---------16:51----------
to something like maybe seven eight

---------16:53----------
something around there for the gate but

---------16:55----------
also this over here attaches to ground

---------16:58----------
now the reason that I think this

---------16:59----------
confuses a lot of people is it's not

---------17:01----------
even because they don't understand how

---------17:02----------
the circuit works

---------17:03----------
it's that they'd rather they don't know

---------17:04----------
where the individual elements are even

---------17:06----------
 going because they never

---------17:07----------
bothered to draw it so look at Q

---------17:10----------
6915 let's take this into context again

---------17:12----------
right so the way that this entire

---------17:16----------
general system is going to work is that

---------17:19----------
this over here is going to allow the

---------17:23----------
cysts one wire line to go from the

---------17:25----------
adapter sense to the SMC so we need to

---------17:28----------
get these transistors or these MOSFETs I

---------17:30----------
guess a MOSFET is a transistor but a lot

---------17:32----------
of people have been trolling me lately

---------17:33----------
at me calling a MOSFET a transistor even

---------17:35----------
though

---------17:36----------
transistor these transistors to piss off

---------17:39----------
the engineers that watch we need to get

---------17:41----------
these turning on and we get these

---------17:43----------
turning on and we have power going

---------17:45----------
through down here now check it out so we

---------17:48----------
have one wire and Nabal over here this

---------17:50----------
one wire enable voltage is pretty much

---------17:52----------
going to be the voltage that comes

---------17:53----------
through from this so when s MC bc AC

---------17:56----------
okay allows this voltage divider to work

---------17:59----------
when this transistor takes this voltage

---------18:01----------
divider and allow us to go to ground

---------18:02----------
it's then going to allow this transistor

---------18:04----------
to send 18 volts through once this

---------18:07----------
transistor has sent 18 volts through we

---------18:09----------
now have this voltage divider working

---------18:11----------
because it's power on the other side

---------18:12----------
which is going to allow these

---------18:14----------
transistors are open and allows this one

---------18:16----------
wire to talk to my SMC however however

---------18:20----------
big however here where can this

---------18:23----------
all go wrong well this voltage here one

---------18:26----------
wire enabled meaning enable my one wire

---------18:28----------
circuit meaning allow these transistors

---------18:31----------
to open this can all be shorted to

---------18:33----------
ground by Q 6915 now let's see this is

---------18:39----------
also an N channel MOSFET meaning that if

---------18:41----------
the power on the gate is higher than the

---------18:43----------
power on the source it's going to sends

---------18:46----------
my one wire enables signal to ground and

---------18:48----------
the reason that you wouldn't tell that

---------18:50----------
from the stupid diagram is that

---------18:52----------
the lazy piece of at Apple in 2009

---------18:55----------
didn't even manage to draw a line to

---------18:58----------
 ground how much work would that

---------18:59----------
have taken for your four hundred billion

---------19:01----------
dollar company anyway but let's take a

---------19:04----------
look at this now this transistor over

---------19:07----------
here is going to pretty this is going to

---------19:11----------
turn on and send my one wire enable

---------19:13----------
voltage here which is the voltage that I

---------19:15----------
need in order for these transistors to

---------19:16----------
work its gonna send it to ground if one

---------19:18----------
wire over volt goes high now what's

---------19:21----------
going to enable one wire over volt to go

---------19:24----------
high this IC this one if it detects

---------19:28----------
something that it doesn't like so this

---------19:31----------
IC is hooked up to the adapter sense

---------19:33----------
line and it's also hooked up to the 18

---------19:38----------
volts from the charger over here right

---------19:41----------
see make sense so here's what usually

---------19:46----------
happens let's go over what usually

---------19:47----------
happens with these circuits you

---------19:49----------
what's going to happen is that this over

---------19:52----------
here see that this resistor are 69 11

---------19:54----------
where it says 470 kilohms it's going to

---------19:57----------
measure 200 or 300 or 100 ohms now I

---------20:01----------
want you to think about the video that I

---------20:03----------
did on resistors and how resistors fail

---------20:05----------
resistors usually fail by becoming a

---------20:08----------
higher resistance than the resistance

---------20:10----------
that it specified to so a 2 ohm resistor

---------20:12----------
may become a hundred kilo ohm resistor

---------20:13----------
100 kilo ohm resistor may become a five

---------20:16----------
million ohm resistor a five million ohm

---------20:18----------
resistor may become a infinity ohms

---------20:20----------
resistor that's the way resistors

---------20:22----------
usually fail resistors don't fail at

---------20:25----------
least in my lifetime I've never seen a

---------20:27----------
resistor fail of any type by going down

---------20:30----------
in resistance I'm not saying it's

---------20:31----------
impossible I'm saying it's something

---------20:33----------
that I've never seen in like ten eleven

---------20:36----------
years of professionally repairing a so

---------20:40----------
this is probably not going to fail our

---------20:43----------
6911 is probably not going to fail so

---------20:45----------
what else is could possibly fail to

---------20:48----------
create zero ohms of resistance between

---------20:50----------
pins 1 & 2 well what else is connected

---------20:52----------
pin 1 of the resistor is attached to pin

---------20:54----------
1 of this transistor pin 2 of this

---------20:57----------
resistor is attached to pin 2 of this

---------20:58----------
transistor if the transistor fails

---------21:01----------
internally and this transistor has a

---------21:02----------
short between pins 1 & 2 then you're

---------21:05----------
going to measure a short on pins 1 in

---------21:07----------
two of the resistors so the resistor

---------21:09----------
usually is not bad what's bad is Q 69 10

---------21:13----------
and Q 69 10 being bad is then going to

---------21:17----------
not allow this entire system will work

---------21:19----------
right when this is shorted so you

---------21:21----------
replace Q 69 10 but nothing is working

---------21:24----------
now one of the things you can do at this

---------21:26----------
point as a cheat not saying you give it

---------21:29----------
back to the customer this way

---------21:31----------
I'm not saying you give it back to the

---------21:33----------
customer this way one thing you can do

---------21:35----------
as a cheat once you replace Q 69 10 is

---------21:40----------
you can remove Q 69 15 and you 69 15

---------21:45----------
what this is going to do is ensure that

---------21:48----------
voltage is going to the one wire circuit

---------21:50----------
all the time you're going to remove Q 69

---------21:54----------
15 and u 69 15 s having a path to ground

---------21:57----------
to screw up your circuit so adapter

---------21:59----------
sense is going to go over here the

---------22:01----------
voltage from here

---------22:02----------
voltage-divider our 69 79 69 18 is going

---------22:05----------
to ensure that once q 69 10 opens that

---------22:08----------
voltage goes over to the gate of these

---------22:09----------
transistors which then allows this one

---------22:11----------
wire to talk to the SMC I'm not saying

---------22:15----------
that you give it back to the customer

---------22:17----------
that way I'm just saying that if you've

---------22:19----------
already measured your adapter sense line

---------22:22----------
and your adapter sense line is 3 2 3

---------22:24----------
point 4 volts and not 16 volts meaning

---------22:27----------
your adapter sense line is within a

---------22:29----------
range that's not going to blow up your

---------22:30----------
SMC that you can remove q 69 15 and use

---------22:34----------
69 15 and see if you get a green light

---------22:37----------
temporarily if you get a green light

---------22:39----------
temporarily then you can buy a new Q 69

---------22:43----------
15 and a you knew you 69 15 and it's

---------22:47----------
gonna be a pain in the ass because if

---------22:49----------
you're like me and you'll only stock

---------22:50----------
donor boards that are relevant to your

---------22:52----------
time you're probably not gonna have a

---------22:54----------
lot of LM 397 s in your in your parts

---------22:57----------
bin so you'll have to order it

---------22:59----------
regardless of how much the customer

---------23:02----------
 and screams you're not gonna

---------23:04----------
leave you 69 15 and Q 69 15 off the

---------23:06----------
board you're not gonna let the one wire

---------23:08----------
protection not be on the board and

---------23:10----------
you're not going to allow the customers

---------23:12----------
balls to explore it if they plug in a

---------23:13----------
knockoff charger don't do that but it is

---------23:18----------
something you can do because again look

---------23:20----------
at this Q 6915 this is where your one

---------23:23----------
wire voltage over here I mean this is

---------23:25----------
the pole this is another public this is

---------23:27----------
the resistant that's going to allow

---------23:28----------
these transistors to open that's going

---------23:30----------
to allow your adapter sense to talk to

---------23:31----------
the SMC that's what you need for a green

---------23:33----------
light if this transistor is bad or this

---------23:35----------
IC is bad it's gonna tell this

---------23:37----------
transistor to do things that it

---------23:38----------
shouldn't or even if the IC isn't bad

---------23:40----------
but the transistor is bad it may short

---------23:42----------
to ground and it will take your one wire

---------23:45----------
voltage away to ground so if you remove

---------23:46----------
Q 6915 and you 6915 you've then removed

---------23:49----------
your path to ground which means that you

---------23:52----------
have a one wire sir you don't have a one

---------23:53----------
you have a one wire circuit which is

---------23:56----------
literally at this point one wire which

---------23:59----------
is bad that is always working and if you

---------24:02----------
get a green light then you can invest in

---------24:05----------
buying this and this and waiting but

---------24:08----------
it's a quick way to cheat and see if

---------24:10----------
your SMC is dead as well and see if it's

---------24:11----------
kind of even worth bothering to fix it's

---------24:13----------
a way you can cheat and look ahead and

---------24:15----------
that's the way the one wire sir

---------24:16----------
it works on this machine so long story

---------24:18----------
short as confusing as this entire

---------24:21----------
looks if you break it down it's very

---------24:22----------
similar to the old machines and if you

---------24:24----------
ever do get to a point in the schematic

---------24:26----------
where you don't know where something is

---------24:28----------
going with the Apple engineer was on

---------24:30----------
crack and you get one of these lines

---------24:31----------
that doesn't go anywhere just go over to

---------24:33----------
your board view software search for the

---------24:35----------
component click on the leg that you

---------24:38----------
don't know where the it goes and on

---------24:39----------
the bottom left you'll get ass it'll

---------24:42----------
tell you where it goes and it'll give

---------24:43----------
you a little bit of an idea so hopefully

---------24:46----------
this has been helpful I know I haven't

---------24:47----------
done a great job at explaining it I'm

---------24:49----------
sorry for that I did want to do a real

---------24:51----------
video of fixing this in real time again

---------24:53----------
some of my videos lately I've been

---------24:55----------
coming out kind of forgetful and shitty

---------24:57----------
and this one was just like a new level

---------24:59----------
of forgetful and shitty and my

---------25:01----------
explanation right now is kind of a good

---------25:03----------
level of forgetful and shitty but I do I

---------25:04----------
did want to do a video on this and it's

---------25:06----------
not something that I come across very

---------25:08----------
often so I know it's something that if I

---------25:10----------
don't make the time now to do a video on

---------25:12----------
I probably never will but hopefully if

---------25:14----------
you're working on one of these older

---------25:15----------
machines with the shitty one wires or

---------25:16----------
the shitty huge complicated one wire

---------25:18----------
circuit this helps and you can see even

---------25:20----------
if you go to this like this the

---------25:22----------
schematics really do get worse and worse

---------25:23----------
like check this one out

---------25:25----------
same one wire circuit by the way same

---------25:27----------
 this is pretty much the exact same

---------25:28----------
thing it's on the 15 inch board from

---------25:31----------
that year rather than the 17 so I just

---------25:33----------
show you to one for the 17 inch board

---------25:34----------
now on the phone for the 15 inch board

---------25:36----------
look they show you these resistors go to

---------25:40----------
ground right look there look at how

---------25:42----------
 nice they where they put crowns

---------25:43----------
and the resistor over here the resistor

---------25:47----------
over here goes through this line and

---------25:48----------
this line goes to ground it was so nice

---------25:50----------
but look Q 69 20 this one wire it's just

---------25:55----------
one wire bilateral bilat whatever Oh pin

---------25:59----------
three weight with doesn't where the

---------26:02----------
 does pin three come from where to

---------26:04----------
 this pin three go - who the hell

---------26:06----------
knows again a big reason that people are

---------26:09----------
confused is because Apple doesn't draw

---------26:11----------
this look look at that look pee-wee

---------26:13----------
Herman is back as a pee-wee Herman has

---------26:15----------
been rehired he's the artist that draws

---------26:18----------
the Apple schematics look at this check

---------26:20----------
it out - adapter sense goes from this is

---------26:25----------
such a new level of stupid I don't even

---------26:26----------
know what to say so it looks like

---------26:28----------
Sigma's going to

---------26:29----------
but it stops here signal signal stops

---------26:32----------
here see in the good schematic and the

---------26:34----------
good schematic you have a depth pin five

---------26:36----------
is signal which goes over to adapter

---------26:39----------
sense which goes over here in the

---------26:42----------
 schematic you have signal

---------26:44----------
signal goes home and then you have

---------26:48----------
adapter sense and adapter Sanj dose goes

---------26:50----------
in a Square and touches itself it just

---------26:55----------
touches itself these these schematics

---------26:58----------
are such I'm telling

---------27:00----------
you every Apple engineer from 2008 and

---------27:03----------
2009 must have been on some amazing

---------27:05----------
 drugs I'm incredibly jealous and

---------27:08----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------27:12----------
you learned something if you did learn

---------27:14----------
something I want to see you apply it

---------27:17----------
apply this stuff fix boards and I will

---------27:21----------
be very happy I remember every time you

---------27:25----------
fix one of these boards that would have

---------27:27----------
been thrown away or you're keeping

---------27:29----------
somebody from buying a new one

---------27:31----------
and every time you keep somebody from

---------27:33----------
buying a new one you're keeping Apple

---------27:35----------
from making money that's gonna put a big

---------27:39----------
smile on all of our faces that's it for

---------27:41----------
today
