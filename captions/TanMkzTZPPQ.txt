---------00:00----------
all right here we have a MacBook with no

---------00:02----------
power this is in a 1398 macbook buy to

---------00:04----------
the fact that in every single one of

---------00:05----------
these videos people know that I take the

---------00:07----------
computer and I put it up like this they

---------00:09----------
wrote the [ __ ] address and email and

---------00:12----------
phone number on the back of the machine

---------00:13----------
so if you all just saw that and wind up

---------00:16----------
calling him [ __ ] it that's on him not me

---------00:18----------
oh no you replace the battery yourself

---------00:21----------
oh no oh no what else did you do so this

---------00:24----------
is pp bus g3 huh

---------00:26----------
I'm gonna see if PP bus g3 hot is short

---------00:28----------
it's a CPU v core as it almost always is

---------00:30----------
on these boards and if it is I'm

---------00:31----------
throwing this out it's not 9.2 million

---------00:35----------
ohms drink alcohol then fix math book in

---------00:38----------
that order you know I've done that

---------00:40----------
before it doesn't always lead to the

---------00:41----------
highest quality MacBook repairs what did

---------00:43----------
they do to you MacBook who are you

---------00:45----------
the first thing we're gonna do is plug

---------00:47----------
the charger going with the battery not

---------00:48----------
plugged in and see how many amps it's

---------00:49----------
taking good night have a good weekend

---------00:51----------
picture a Phoebe 48 megapixel picture of

---------00:53----------
Phoebe Phoebe no maybe I want to see

---------00:56----------
picture Steve won't send me a picture of

---------00:59----------
his new kidiots are you this god-awful

---------01:01----------
mean evil man alright it's taking 30

---------01:05----------
milliamps which reads our pp bus is

---------01:08----------
likely gonna be present we have a light

---------01:10----------
in the charger which means P P 3 before

---------01:11----------
2 is present if we have 12 point 56

---------01:13----------
volts over here that means the SMC is

---------01:14----------
turning on interesting PP bus is not

---------01:18----------
present P P bus is 1.8 volts that's no

---------01:20----------
good alright this may actually be

---------01:22----------
something that we can solve alright so

---------01:23----------
the first thing we're gonna do is we're

---------01:24----------
gonna take the screws out of this

---------01:25----------
MacBook now they're the wrong screws in

---------01:27----------
the wrong place but that's what we

---------01:28----------
expect from a MacBook that's been open

---------01:29----------
before let's just pray that they didn't

---------01:32----------
put the long screw in the short hole oh

---------01:34----------
god you bastard you did you put the long

---------01:37----------
screw in the short hole so now we are

---------01:39----------
decreasing the standard for this repair

---------01:41----------
from turns on and everything functions

---------01:43----------
to fans bin because you put the long

---------01:45----------
screw in the short hole right next to

---------01:47----------
the graphics chip which means I can

---------01:49----------
expect that the GPU data lines be messed

---------01:52----------
so if this has a fan spin I'm done my

---------01:56----------
website is quite clear but not sending

---------01:58----------
in mac books that other people have

---------01:59----------
destroyed this display assembly it's for

---------02:02----------
the wrong year this is the thin webcam

---------02:04----------
cable thin webcam cable thick webcam

---------02:08----------
you do not use thin webcam assembly'

---------02:11----------
in an 8 to 0 37 87 board to use that in

---------02:13----------
a 2-0 33:32 board this is incorrect any

---------02:16----------
correct

---------02:21----------
all right so PP brush g3 hot is missing

---------02:24----------
so let's take a look at you 70 100 which

---------02:26----------
is gonna be the circuit responsible for

---------02:27----------
creating keep you bet g3 hot now the

---------02:29----------
first thing that we noticed if we take a

---------02:30----------
look at that circuit is that our we have

---------02:31----------
resistors that have holes in them look

---------02:34----------
at that look at that see how those

---------02:36----------
resistors look like they have eyes

---------02:39----------
bamm-bamm these resistors don't have

---------02:42----------
eyes but those two resistors do these

---------02:45----------
two resistors don't have eyes see that

---------02:52----------
but these two resistors have eyes look

---------02:55----------
at that the Paul Daniel software says 10

---------02:58----------
kilohms for that one and 7 kilohms for

---------03:02----------
that one now let's take a look on the

---------03:05----------
schematic and board view software for an

---------03:07----------
8 - 0 - 37 87 MacBook and take a look at

---------03:10----------
what those resistors are for you like

---------03:14----------
how fast I found those resistors don't

---------03:15----------
you don't you I just went over to the

---------03:18----------
board I went like this poom and I could

---------03:21----------
immediately focus in on the spot that

---------03:22----------
needed my attention well if you found

---------03:24----------
that impressive you should know that I'm

---------03:26----------
single

---------03:27----------
don't delay if you're a part of the 0.03

---------03:30----------
percent of my audience

---------03:31----------
that's female come and get a date today

---------03:33----------
we do over here is we're gonna take a

---------03:35----------
look at a board view for an 8 - 0 - 37

---------03:39----------
87 that's our 71 21 and our 71 22 now

---------03:43----------
these are the resistors between the

---------03:45----------
current sensing resistor and the u 7100

---------03:48----------
this over here is a current sensing

---------03:50----------
resistor now the way this works is quite

---------03:52----------
simple let's say you were trying to tell

---------03:53----------
how fast the water was flowing through a

---------03:55----------
stream you would have to put your hands

---------03:57----------
in the stream so that you could

---------03:58----------
physically feel how fast the water is

---------04:00----------
moving however if you're far away let's

---------04:02----------
say you're on top of a mountain you

---------04:04----------
won't be able to tell so you would need

---------04:05----------
your friend to put your hands in the

---------04:06----------
water and then if you're going to

---------04:08----------
actually type into the computer and

---------04:09----------
you're home up in the mountain how fast

---------04:11----------
it's going you need your friend to yell

---------04:12----------
over to you how fast it's moving so

---------04:14----------
that's what's happening over here so

---------04:16----------
over here you have the the current

---------04:18----------
that's flowing through from the charger

---------04:21----------
so this

---------04:21----------
whether this is where the current is

---------04:23----------
gonna be coming in from the adapter let

---------04:24----------
me just give you a better view

---------04:27----------
let's get just PDF in the screen here we

---------04:31----------
go so this is where it's coming in from

---------04:37----------
the adapter it's going to go through

---------04:39----------
these transistors so this this is where

---------04:41----------
it's coming from the charger now over

---------04:43----------
here this is a resistor this is just

---------04:45----------
like the guy's hands in the stream in

---------04:47----------
the river this resistor is going to

---------04:49----------
create a teeny tiny bicicleta x' worth

---------04:53----------
as Cartman would say of a voltage drop

---------04:55----------
across it and that teeny tiny voltage

---------04:57----------
drop is going to be proportional to how

---------05:00----------
much current the system is using so a

---------05:02----------
big voltage difference between the top

---------05:04----------
of the resistor in the bottom means lots

---------05:06----------
of current being used a small voltage

---------05:10----------
drop is going to mean a tiny amount of

---------05:12----------
current being used now this is the chip

---------05:16----------
that needs to know all of that but it's

---------05:18----------
not in the stream this is the guy up in

---------05:20----------
the mountain typing stuff into his

---------05:21----------
computer so this would be the flood the

---------05:23----------
guy with his hand in the stream are 7120

---------05:25----------
and then he's gonna yell over to you 70

---------05:28----------
100 and Goyo the stream is moving fast

---------05:31----------
and think of this like the the telephone

---------05:34----------
line or whatever the walkie-talkie

---------05:36----------
whatever the hell in between so the line

---------05:38----------
between the top of the resistor and the

---------05:39----------
bottom of this current sense resistor

---------05:41----------
has a 10 ohm resistor in between on each

---------05:43----------
side however those two resistors are

---------05:45----------
blown which we spotted with startling

---------05:48----------
efficiency now we're gonna have to

---------05:51----------
replace those resistors but before we

---------05:53----------
replace those resistors we have to

---------05:55----------
figure out why they blew because if you

---------05:58----------
don't figure out why they blew they're

---------06:00----------
gonna blow again and we don't want to

---------06:01----------
have to have them blow again that's also

---------06:04----------
inefficient so what we're gonna do over

---------06:06----------
here and see if there's a short-circuit

---------06:08----------
at the bottom of either resistor as you

---------06:11----------
can see at the bottom of each resistor

---------06:13----------
there is a one point set here we go

---------06:15----------
there is a 1 ohm short to ground over

---------06:17----------
here now what can be shorted on that

---------06:20----------
line it could be the capacitor the other

---------06:23----------
capacitor or the ISL 6259 and I'm gonna

---------06:27----------
take a guess that the ISL 65:9 is the

---------06:29----------
chip dad died most likely because this

---------06:32----------
cheap schmuck was using a knockoff

---------06:33----------
charger and

---------06:34----------
his board one way to find out that we

---------06:37----------
can remove the you 7,000 and see and if

---------06:39----------
that you 7000 is dead then I know that

---------06:42----------
you used a knockoff charger there are

---------06:46----------
people staring in my window so I just

---------06:48----------
waved to them and said hi

---------06:53----------
that's quite strange this is not

---------06:56----------
supposed to be a fishbowl please don't

---------06:58----------
stare it please don't tap on the glass

---------07:02----------
the animals are sensitive to that this

---------07:07----------
is not a zoo

---------07:20----------
now we're going to measure and see if

---------07:24----------
there's a short to ground short to

---------07:27----------
ground is gone

---------07:28----------
meaning that you use the knockoff charge

---------07:31----------
or didn't you and you lied about it you

---------07:33----------
didn't put it in your intake form I'm

---------07:37----------
disappointed in you I'm not angry at you

---------07:40----------
I'm just very disappointed

---------08:11----------
okay remove all that mixture of leaded

---------08:13----------
and lead free solder

---------09:13----------
that will never happen unless they're

---------09:18----------
drunk and one of you use the bathroom

---------09:20----------
for free that happens every now and then

---------09:21----------
on Friday and Saturday night

---------09:37----------
okay so

---------10:05----------
beautiful

---------10:11----------
now we're going to get ourselves a donor

---------10:15----------
to steal these pieces from and then

---------10:17----------
we're gonna have a working board

---------10:53----------
okay

---------12:19----------
we're gonna have to warn this person to

---------12:21----------
never using knockoff charger again spend

---------12:25----------
the money at the Apple store for the

---------12:26----------
charger that's not a piece of crap

---------12:28----------
if you buying some piece of [ __ ]

---------12:29----------
computer buy a piece of [ __ ] charger you

---------12:32----------
bought a super expensive MacBook which

---------12:35----------
means you can probably afford to buy

---------12:36----------
they're super expensive snowflake

---------12:38----------
charger to go with it fans been ladies

---------12:50----------
and gentlemen another MacBook saved from

---------12:53----------
the scrap heap of an Apple Store another

---------12:57----------
MacBook and if you want to learn more

---------13:00----------
about how to do exactly what it is that

---------13:01----------
I'm doing right here and you want to

---------13:03----------
learn how to do it in an environment

---------13:04----------
that's free of pre and post roll ads in

---------13:07----------
actually better quality and superior

---------13:10----------
categorization than here head over to

---------13:13----------
boards dot Rossmann group.com boards dot

---------13:16----------
Rossmann group comm is not only home to

---------13:18----------
the paid form when we have engineers

---------13:20----------
answering your questions for $29 a month

---------13:22----------
but it is also home to a bunch of free

---------13:25----------
videos just like the one that you're

---------13:27----------
watching here you can click repair

---------13:28----------
videos buy model or repair videos by

---------13:31----------
problem if you choose repair videos by

---------13:33----------
model you can click here and it will

---------13:35----------
bring you to every single model board

---------13:38----------
that there is so you could simply click

---------13:39----------
on e - 0 - 30 787 and it will bring you

---------13:43----------
to a list of videos that are hosted

---------13:45----------
somewhere else other than YouTube so if

---------13:47----------
YouTube ever decides to do something

---------13:48----------
stupid in my account goes away it's all

---------13:50----------
still hosted here or you can go to

---------13:52----------
MacBook Board repair videos by problem

---------13:54----------
type click and you have PV bus g3 heart

---------13:56----------
missing no green light and charger p.m.

---------13:59----------
sleep s4l missing and so on and so forth

---------14:01----------
for every single one of these types of

---------14:03----------
problems you can click and then you

---------14:05----------
click over here and there will be a list

---------14:07----------
of different videos these videos are all

---------14:10----------
hosted by Vimeo is a great plan it cost

---------14:12----------
me only like 900 or so something here so

---------14:14----------
not only do I have somebody I can

---------14:16----------
actually talk to on like YouTube if my

---------14:18----------
videos go down but you get to watch the

---------14:20----------
videos with zero pre-roll and zero post

---------14:23----------
roll ads since I'm actually paying for

---------14:24----------
the hosting and best part of all these

---------14:27----------
are the videos uploaded from the

---------14:29----------
original masters and Vimeo encodes look

---------14:31----------
far better than YouTube encodes

---------14:33----------
so not only can you watch the videos

---------14:35----------
here in better quality not only can you

---------14:37----------
watch the videos with zero

---------14:38----------
advertisements but they're all perfectly

---------14:41----------
sorted so if you're learning for the and

---------14:43----------
you're just starting to fix boards on

---------14:45----------
your own you can look up your specific

---------14:47----------
board model number or your specific

---------14:49----------
problem with your board and then get

---------14:51----------
directed to a video that's a likely

---------14:53----------
exactly what you need

---------14:54----------
rather than wade through a playlist on

---------14:55----------
YouTube of six or seven hundred

---------14:57----------
different videos of random different

---------14:58----------
problems I'm hoping that sorting things

---------15:00----------
out like this is going to make it easier

---------15:01----------
for people like you to you know kind of

---------15:04----------
learn and it's not just that getting the

---------15:06----------
information out there it's getting the

---------15:07----------
information out there in a way that is

---------15:09----------
easily digestible to new people that is

---------15:11----------
what I find to be most important so

---------15:14----------
hopefully you've learned something and

---------15:16----------
let's move on to the next MacBook

---------15:27----------
do you have a MacBook they need to be

---------15:29----------
fixed come by our store which is open to

---------15:31----------
the public 22 6 First Avenue in
