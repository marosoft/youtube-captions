---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're gonna be working on a board

---------00:03----------
there's got a bunch of really funky

---------00:05----------
stickers on it for this a 1706 MacBook

---------00:10----------
Pro it doesn't turn on

---------00:11----------
I still haven't set up my overhead

---------00:13----------
camera yet because busy so you can't see

---------00:15----------
me take the Machine apart so I'm gonna

---------00:17----------
explain what's going on with it to you

---------00:18----------
as I do my work and maybe you'll be able

---------00:22----------
to learn something I also don't have my

---------00:24----------
USB CMU dorami because I don't know

---------00:26----------
which box it's in but once we unpack

---------00:29----------
every box we'll get there soon so first

---------00:32----------
thing I'm going to do is check the

---------00:35----------
amount of Oh beautiful David as he is

---------00:38----------
this yours but if I take it then you

---------00:41----------
won't get it back alright David also has

---------00:45----------
a nicer font than mine mine yours is

---------00:47----------
like a sans-serif mine is kind of like a

---------00:49----------
sans always been more of a sans-serif

---------00:51----------
man myself so it's taking five point 18

---------00:54----------
volts at zero point zero zero amps now

---------00:56----------
on these boards in order to get to 20

---------00:59----------
volts the cd32 15 ship which is the USBC

---------01:01----------
MUX needs to get 3.3 volts of power and

---------01:05----------
if it doesn't get that it's not gonna

---------01:06----------
work so let's open up a schematic and a

---------01:08----------
board view for an 8 - 0 - 0 0 - 3 9

---------01:11----------
board and see if we can figure out how

---------01:13----------
to make this thing work again and make

---------01:15----------
it into a happy little MacBook that gets

---------01:17----------
fan spin where we got a good record so

---------01:20----------
far getting fan spin I got myself a pure

---------01:22----------
air VLF 48 to match Steve's other VLF 48

---------01:26----------
I bought it as broken not working and we

---------01:28----------
got the fan of spin because we are

---------01:30----------
there's anything we know how to do here

---------01:32----------
it's make the fan spin we may not be

---------01:34----------
able to get anything else to work other

---------01:35----------
than fan spin but a pure air VLF 48

---------01:37----------
don't need cpu vcore it doesn't need to

---------01:40----------
post and it doesn't need PPV core SOG PU

---------01:42----------
it literally just needs fan spin so I'm

---------01:44----------
on a roll here so let's take a look at

---------01:47----------
what's going on with this MacBook

---------01:49----------
motherboard I haven't had a time to get

---------01:52----------
my desk arranged in the office I'm

---------01:53----------
literally just using this for making

---------01:55----------
videos and working out there for the

---------01:56----------
time being because that allows me to

---------01:58----------
help customers while I'm fixing boards

---------02:00----------
and I am gonna be doing a lot of double

---------02:03----------
duty until everybody has finished

---------02:04----------
unpacking their stuff and moving

---------02:06----------
everything in which is taking lots of

---------02:09----------
time since people

---------02:10----------
there's just there's an abs enormous

---------02:13----------
pile of work that needs to be done here

---------02:17----------
so what do I mean when I say that we're

---------02:20----------
getting five volts in the CD 3250 need

---------02:22----------
to be getting 20 that's a great question

---------02:24----------
so here you have the USB see much chip

---------02:27----------
this is going to be the charge port

---------02:29----------
right over here on the computer the

---------02:30----------
charge port plugs in a J 3300 I can show

---------02:33----------
you in the overhead camera but haven't

---------02:35----------
had time to hook it up yet so that's

---------02:37----------
this that's the charger port and it

---------02:39----------
plugs in right over there now this is

---------02:42----------
going to speak to the CD 32 15 ship if I

---------02:47----------
clicked here you would eventually find a

---------02:50----------
line that speaks to this happy little CD

---------02:53----------
32 15 which is my USB muxing chip right

---------02:57----------
here C charge port goes up here and it's

---------03:01----------
gonna speak to the CD 32 15 now more

---------03:08----------
importantly so how does this chip get

---------03:11----------
power that's another excellent question

---------03:13----------
over here on the top you have V in V and

---------03:17----------
if we follow that it goes to pp 3 V 3

---------03:20----------
underscore g3 huh do we have that power

---------03:22----------
line present on the machine because if

---------03:24----------
we don't we're not going to get this to

---------03:26----------
work that's not gonna be able to allow

---------03:28----------
the machine to speak to this USB C

---------03:30----------
charger and tell it hey I'm not a go pro

---------03:32----------
I'm a MacBook give me 20 volts instead

---------03:34----------
of that 5 volt nonsense we're gonna turn

---------03:37----------
on Paul Daniels is amazing multimeter

---------03:38----------
software we're gonna measure and see

---------03:41----------
what we get on our PP 3 V 4 to

---------03:43----------
underscore I mean P P 3 V 3 underscore

---------03:45----------
g3 hot circuit I'm getting the names of

---------03:47----------
the rails wrong because I forget most of

---------03:50----------
the what I'm doing because I'm losing my

---------03:54----------
mind slowly okay let's take a look at

---------03:57----------
the pp 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot circuit

---------04:00----------
and see if we can figure out why weren't

---------04:02----------
missing that power rail because without

---------04:03----------
that rail our USBC MUX won't turn on

---------04:05----------
without our USB see much turning on the

---------04:07----------
charger won't turn on him without the

---------04:08----------
charger turning on the machine won't

---------04:09----------
turn on now this here is the pp 3 V 3

---------04:12----------
underscore g3 hot creation circuit so

---------04:14----------
let's take a look at this lovely circuit

---------04:16----------
here and see what's going on with it now

---------04:18----------
if you take a look at this circuit

---------04:20----------
you'll see that we have eight this is

---------04:22----------
very similar to the pp three before to

---------04:23----------
underscore G's

---------04:24----------
circuit on older MacBooks this can be

---------04:28----------
powered from either the DCN board or the

---------04:30----------
battery of people Bosch g3 hotter it's

---------04:32----------
gonna be powered by the DCN board now

---------04:34----------
the first thing I'm interested in here

---------04:35----------
is it being told to turn on and you can

---------04:38----------
always Google Mac seven seven five nine

---------04:40----------
six if you wanna really get a perfect

---------04:42----------
explanation of what everything does and

---------04:44----------
all that other rubbish but I'm a simple

---------04:46----------
person I just I play my wheel of fortune

---------04:48----------
like you know guess my vowel here this

---------04:51----------
is PM n p3 v 3 g3 hot is going to en e N

---------04:56----------
and enable enable so we need voltage on

---------05:00----------
pin 10 in order for this to work so

---------05:01----------
let's see where that shows up in my

---------05:03----------
board view over here and see if it's

---------05:05----------
being enabled so we can see if the chips

---------05:06----------
being told to turn on I'm not gonna

---------05:08----------
blame the chip for not working if it's

---------05:10----------
not being told to turn on so let's see

---------05:12----------
what we get on pin 10 no this chip I'm

---------05:14----------
gonna go into the microscope camera over

---------05:16----------
here we're gonna put the chip nice and

---------05:17----------
focus right over there and beautiful

---------05:19----------
focus I've actually seen online that

---------05:22----------
there's a fork a microscope camera that

---------05:24----------
you can get now that does 60 frames a

---------05:27----------
second it's really tempting to get that

---------05:29----------
but maybe once my credit card doesn't

---------05:32----------
have like 30 or 40 or 50 thousand

---------05:34----------
dollars of crap on it but it's [ __ ]

---------05:37----------
tempting like there's something about

---------05:38----------
video equipment and I can't say what it

---------05:40----------
is where I'm more than happy to look at

---------05:43----------
it and say you know what my credit card

---------05:44----------
balance is 50k right now after moving

---------05:46----------
not really sure what I'm gonna do about

---------05:47----------
that but I'm willing to add to that so I

---------05:50----------
can have more pixels on the screen when

---------05:52----------
this clearly works it's just it's it's

---------05:53----------
it's crazy and the problem is that I

---------05:55----------
have a man named Paul who works here and

---------05:57----------
every time I say that I don't need it I

---------05:59----------
just want it he'll say you know you need

---------06:02----------
it he's the absolute worst influence

---------06:03----------
when it comes to this and the worst part

---------06:05----------
about this is that this store is very

---------06:07----------
close to B&H photo we're actually much

---------06:09----------
closer it's about a three minute walk

---------06:11----------
now from B&H which means that every time

---------06:14----------
I have these these tube stupid terrible

---------06:16----------
awful god yeah

---------06:19----------
thoughts is that I'm right near the

---------06:22----------
place or I can display John it it's

---------06:26----------
really really bad so bad so awful

---------06:30----------
so speaking of awful we have point zero

---------06:33----------
five volts and our enabled so now let's

---------06:35----------
try to trace that back and see where our

---------06:36----------
enable comes from now if we trace that

---------06:38----------
back

---------06:38----------
on the board you could see zoom out a

---------06:41----------
little bit here yet it shows up on you

---------06:44----------
7,000 u 7,000 look at that right over

---------06:50----------
here and that is our ISL of 9 2 3 9 ship

---------06:56----------
which appleís is an is all 6 2 5 9

---------06:59----------
because well you know it's all the

---------07:02----------
unauthorized repair people that don't

---------07:03----------
know what they're doing

---------07:04----------
I may be unauthorized but I know the

---------07:07----------
name of the chip that I need on the

---------07:09----------
computer I don't like it's really really

---------07:14----------
getting hard to make that argument that

---------07:16----------
the unauthorized people suck at what

---------07:17----------
they do Apple these hearings through

---------07:20----------
your trade associations because you

---------07:21----------
don't want to show up yourself to lobby

---------07:23----------
against right to repair you get the CTA

---------07:24----------
to do it for you hard to make that

---------07:26----------
argument when your own [ __ ] manuals

---------07:28----------
don't list the names of the chips as

---------07:30----------
what they actually are but I'm not salty

---------07:33----------
I'm not salty at all so let's check out

---------07:37----------
the that on the machine which means I'm

---------07:39----------
gonna have to take this board out and

---------07:41----------
take a look at that chip on the other

---------07:42----------
side of the board and see what's going

---------07:44----------
on with it and I guess you'll just get

---------07:45----------
to see my ugly face for the time being

---------07:47----------
because I don't have the overhead camera

---------07:50----------
I'm gonna see my ugly face with my

---------07:53----------
scruffy hair since they didn't have any

---------07:55----------
conditioner left at the gym after I oh I

---------07:57----------
didn't take a shower there usually they

---------07:59----------
do this time they didn't you don't want

---------08:01----------
it you need a great thing to put on yeah

---------08:04----------
yeah that's that's cancer

---------08:05----------
Louis you'll be be NHS newest VIP

---------08:08----------
customer no no more be in no B&H no B&H

---------08:11----------
i went there the other day and i spent

---------08:13----------
400 something dollars on a bag because

---------08:15----------
it's really difficult to carry around

---------08:17----------
all the scraps all the right to repair

---------08:19----------
earrings because i have all this backup

---------08:20----------
[ __ ] like i have a laptop i have the

---------08:22----------
camcorder i have the two lenses i have

---------08:23----------
the external battery for when the i

---------08:25----------
can't get stuff plugged in properly i

---------08:27----------
have two wireless stuff all that [ __ ]

---------08:29----------
I've been lugging it around in two

---------08:30----------
separate bags that are both exploding it

---------08:32----------
makes it and it also it doesn't hold a

---------08:34----------
tripod properly and a lot of the times

---------08:36----------
you're kind of running and gunning

---------08:37----------
sometimes I like to be able to speak to

---------08:38----------
people outside of the room that showed

---------08:39----------
up and it's much and I want to be able

---------08:41----------
to do that before people leave so I got

---------08:44----------
this different bag that would allow me

---------08:45----------
to actually speak to people outside a

---------08:48----------
little bit easier roll stuff around

---------08:49----------
quicker

---------08:50----------
maybe my stuff wouldn't get broken as

---------08:52----------
much when I travel I learned that lesson

---------08:54----------
from my lens getting sodomized but like

---------08:56----------
that was that was supposed to be it but

---------08:57----------
then I walked it to be an H and once you

---------08:59----------
shop at B&H they send you this book of

---------09:01----------
all the other stuff that they have it's

---------09:03----------
so dangerous it's so dangerous

---------09:05----------
it's scary I'm telling you because when

---------09:09----------
you look in the book of this stuff it's

---------09:10----------
like well I have an aps-c camera

---------09:13----------
wouldn't it be nice to have a super 35

---------09:14----------
millimeter towards setting up the

---------09:16----------
overhead camera Thank You n BOTS I have

---------09:18----------
a 1080p camera would it be nice to have

---------09:20----------
a 4k 60 camera that does super that has

---------09:22----------
a super 35 millimeter sensor rather than

---------09:24----------
aps-c what if you get a 6k camera

---------09:27----------
because it'll look better when you

---------09:28----------
downsampled a 4k than just recording in

---------09:30----------
4k but that thing doesn't record an

---------09:32----------
intra frame so it's harder to edit you

---------09:33----------
want the camera that can record an intra

---------09:35----------
frame so it's easier to know not going

---------09:37----------
down that [ __ ] nope not going down that

---------09:39----------
rabbit hole I love my little Sony NEX a

---------09:41----------
50 a little obsolete piece of [ __ ]

---------09:43----------
camera

---------09:44----------
it's broken HD you know I got as a

---------09:47----------
broken HDMI port I bought an HDMI port

---------09:49----------
it's actually pretty impressive this

---------09:51----------
thing comes straight from Sony check the

---------09:52----------
cellar that sony logo on the parts bin

---------09:55----------
by the way see that fast autofocus

---------09:56----------
that's why I don't have a Panasonic

---------09:58----------
someone asked me why I don't have a

---------09:59----------
Panasonic look at this so it set the

---------10:01----------
face focus right now so it's not gonna

---------10:02----------
focus on the bag quickly when I take the

---------10:04----------
bag out of you found you oh my or if I

---------10:07----------
do this the Panasonic autofocus is

---------10:11----------
[ __ ] terrible on the gh4 I can move

---------10:16----------
this around like crazy but I'm always in

---------10:18----------
focus running and gunning with exploding

---------10:20----------
bags and government buildings what can

---------10:21----------
go wrong indeed Christopher Kelley what

---------10:23----------
could go wrong yeah I've seen the

---------10:24----------
Panasonic gh4 and G face focus and

---------10:28----------
tracking for an expensive camera that

---------10:30----------
[ __ ] is awful yeah Sony autofocus is

---------10:32----------
really on point and one thing I read I

---------10:33----------
was looking at the sony fs7 I was this

---------10:35----------
close the bidding on them when I really

---------10:37----------
I like I know I cannot [ __ ] buy that

---------10:39----------
[ __ ] right now like that now is not the

---------10:40----------
time to buy a new camera and I was this

---------10:43----------
close to winning one which thank God I

---------10:44----------
did not because I probably would have

---------10:45----------
wound up backing out of it and getting

---------10:47----------
an ebay on paid item claim apparently it

---------10:50----------
focuses slower than this thing like how

---------10:51----------
is it to the sony fs7 first generation a

---------10:54----------
slower autofocus than e NEX da 50 which

---------10:57----------
by all standards is kind of a prosumer

---------10:59----------
camera not even really a professional

---------11:00----------
one but the face auto detect and focus

---------11:04----------
on this thing

---------11:04----------
really on point like it knows where I am

---------11:06----------
all the time can utilize camera do that

---------11:12----------
actually Eli's probably can because he

---------11:14----------
his is a Sony they have really good

---------11:16----------
autofocus I used to make fun of Paul for

---------11:18----------
walking into B and H and then leaving

---------11:19----------
like three or four six thousand dollars

---------11:21----------
lighter but I get it I really do

---------11:23----------
I get it I can't make fun of them

---------11:25----------
anymore for it cuz I'm not I'm not much

---------11:27----------
better right so here we have the is l9

---------11:29----------
239 and the chip looks fine I don't see

---------11:31----------
anything wrong with this chip but what

---------11:33----------
I'm going to do is I'm gonna replace it

---------11:35----------
with another one because it's not

---------11:37----------
putting out the signal that it supposed

---------11:38----------
to and that makes me mad so I'm gonna

---------11:40----------
put the right amount of Amtech flux on

---------11:42----------
top of it just a little bit just a

---------11:48----------
little flux not too much not too little

---------11:50----------
not too much and I don't have a mat in

---------11:53----------
my office yet I forgot to buy something

---------11:55----------
so I'm gonna use a donor board as my mat

---------11:56----------
for now so I don't burn the desk too

---------11:59----------
badly all right there we go there we go

---------12:05----------
all right are we all ready for this is

---------12:08----------
l9 239 replacement are you excited by

---------12:11----------
the way you may notice that this board

---------12:12----------
has zero liquid damage so what does that

---------12:15----------
tell you that the board is zero liquid

---------12:17----------
but it's dead

---------12:20----------
if this chip fixes the problem what does

---------12:23----------
this board lack of liquid damage tell

---------12:25----------
you

---------12:33----------
what this tells me is that it's not

---------12:37----------
simply people that get liquid on their

---------12:38----------
MacBooks that end up with a dead MacBook

---------12:40----------
you could not do it anything bad to this

---------12:43----------
you could treat the MacBook very nicely

---------12:44----------
and you can still have a problem where

---------12:47----------
it just dies and it's just dead and this

---------12:50----------
is why when I show up at these hearings

---------12:52----------
and I talk about the lack of

---------12:53----------
availability of certain chipsets that

---------12:55----------
it's important because with the new

---------12:57----------
machine if you had this exact same

---------12:59----------
problem with this chip failing it would

---------13:01----------
be an absolute nightmare for me to fix

---------13:02----------
it what I have to do with the new

---------13:04----------
machine is I need to order a battery

---------13:07----------
board for a hundred and twenty nine

---------13:08----------
dollars take the chip off of it then

---------13:11----------
reball that chip which is an extra pain

---------13:13----------
in the ass

---------13:14----------
solder it onto the board and you bet

---------13:16----------
your ass at that for $129 and extra work

---------13:19----------
is getting passed on to the customer and

---------13:21----------
then throw away the battery board

---------13:25----------
because that battery board and battery

---------13:27----------
that goes with it is now useless it's a

---------13:29----------
complete and utter waste it adds to the

---------13:32----------
turnaround time of the repair it makes

---------13:34----------
for a pissed-off customer they're not

---------13:38----------
only going to be pissed off at Apple

---------13:39----------
because the product is less repairable

---------13:41----------
but they're also going to be pissed off

---------13:43----------
at me and that sucks by the way the pad

---------13:46----------
that came off is a not connected pad as

---------13:48----------
you can see over here in the schematic

---------13:49----------
and board view so it doesn't really

---------13:51----------
matter and the unconnected pads come off

---------13:53----------
very easily because they're not really

---------13:54----------
it he's on the board that will you know

---------13:56----------
how you don't do the you don't do your

---------13:59----------
job as well when you know that it

---------14:01----------
doesn't matter the people when the board

---------14:03----------
is put together it's kind of similar

---------14:04----------
like the pads just don't stick as well

---------14:06----------
onto the sections where there's nothing

---------14:08----------
there where there's no signal so don't

---------14:12----------
feel too bad if when there's a part of

---------14:15----------
your job that no one will notice no one

---------14:16----------
will care about no one will use you

---------14:18----------
don't do it as well because the trillion

---------14:20----------
dollar company pretty much does the

---------14:21----------
exact same thing the boy in that there's

---------14:25----------
no big deal about that those pads never

---------14:27----------
stick as well if it's and if it's an NC

---------14:29----------
pad or unconnect as you can see my ISO 9

---------14:32----------
239 also made a jump for it

---------14:35----------
that's the other reason why it's nice to

---------14:37----------
have chips and spools because if the

---------14:39----------
chip makes it jump if the chip tries to

---------14:41----------
escape you can just grab another one out

---------14:44----------
of the spool instead

---------14:45----------
like if this was $129 every time that

---------14:48----------
happened I would be very very pissed off

---------14:50----------
all right Who am I kidding I just the

---------14:52----------
lower the air airflow on my hot air

---------14:54----------
station okay let's put this chip back on

---------15:05----------
see if Lewis remembers how to replace a

---------15:07----------
BGA it's been a while hasn't it well I'm

---------15:13----------
sure we can get this thing on

---------15:40----------
now here's something even if you're

---------15:42----------
using a ridiculous amount of air so

---------15:43----------
right now just to make a point I'm going

---------15:44----------
to do this at full air flow if you start

---------15:46----------
it from far away and the flux gets warm

---------15:49----------
it's going to start to engulf the balls

---------15:53----------
so that it's easier to solder it on the

---------15:57----------
board without it flying away see that

---------15:59----------
see that surface tension I work there

---------16:00----------
that surface tension at work that's

---------16:03----------
beautiful

---------16:04----------
okay it's solder now we're just going to

---------16:06----------
wait for it to cool off for a moment now

---------16:08----------
I believe that we have a very nicely

---------16:12----------
fixed board at this point I'm gonna take

---------16:14----------
up my bets that this is going to take

---------16:16----------
twenty volts and just turn on and work

---------16:18----------
beautifully no questions asked no

---------16:21----------
problems at all or not okay maybe

---------16:28----------
there's a little bit over there I'm kind

---------16:30----------
of curious how much that corrosion has

---------16:31----------
to do with it that's corrosion by the

---------16:32----------
bottom cd32 fifteen we'll see how much

---------16:35----------
that affects it in a second five volts

---------16:40----------
zero amps oh okay

---------16:46----------
so perhaps it wasn't the ISO

---------16:48----------
ninety-three 9 after all okay let's

---------16:54----------
scrape the corrosion over here

---------17:02----------
scrape scrape scrape turn up didn't

---------17:05----------
scrape scrape scrape do not

---------17:42----------
this board is actually gonna make me

---------17:44----------
work for my money okay so we're getting

---------17:48----------
five volts on the enable so the ISO nine

---------17:51----------
two three nine change actually did do

---------17:53----------
something because before we add zero

---------17:54----------
volts on that enable but now as you can

---------17:56----------
see we get five volts on enable and PP

---------18:01----------
3v3 underscore g3 hot is still zero

---------18:03----------
point zero eight so that's that's a

---------18:05----------
problem so now let's try and figure out

---------18:07----------
why PPV three underscore g3 hot is

---------18:09----------
missing and figure out why that's

---------18:11----------
missing I am going to get my board view

---------18:15----------
software on the screen okay let's see if

---------18:17----------
voltage is coming into the chip so right

---------18:20----------
over here on d6 nine on two I'm supposed

---------18:22----------
to have the 18 volts of the five volts

---------18:26----------
on the charger in this case going

---------18:27----------
through there let's see if I have it

---------18:28----------
coming through

---------18:39----------
[Music]

---------18:42----------
4.6 alright that's doing what it's

---------18:44----------
supposed to wait I'm measuring the wrong

---------18:51----------
resistor that's P P bus that's not P P 3

---------18:53----------
P 3 okay I am getting this is P P 3 P 3

---------18:58----------
I'm being dumb 1.5 yeah that's kind of

---------19:03----------
there it's kind of half there ok let's

---------19:10----------
see do we have any so it's trying you

---------19:14----------
know it's not full but it's something

---------19:16----------
kind of wondering if this campus sitter

---------19:18----------
is giving me an active short capacitor

---------19:24----------
had corrosion on it and that is this

---------19:27----------
one's for P P 3 P 3 underscore G 3 huh

---------19:29----------
and this is for the L do for this chip

---------19:33----------
let's see what happens if we just take

---------19:35----------
those two off see what happens here

---------19:47----------
a wild erica has just appeared

---------19:56----------
Erica says hello to YouTube and twitch

---------19:59----------
unlike Lewis Erica doesn't forget about

---------20:02----------
twitch although she does this twitch

---------20:05----------
second even though it's alphabetically

---------20:06----------
first trigger hard I can't eat cookies

---------20:12----------
Erica out of shape I did I'm not gonna

---------20:20----------
undo it by eating a cookie no cookie

---------20:35----------
no cookie yeah I don't have any alcohol

---------20:38----------
back here can you give me some alcohol

---------20:40----------
go from it and now just give me it give

---------20:43----------
me an alcohol bottle they gotta be

---------20:44----------
somewhere I'm gonna have to get an

---------20:48----------
alcohol dispenser back here Thank You

---------20:53----------
Aaron

---------20:54----------
everybody say thank you to our assistant

---------20:56----------
Erica here we go five point two volts

---------20:59----------
300 milliamps and now it's taking 20

---------21:02----------
volts at 0.45 M so most likely we had a

---------21:05----------
short two grounds on that capacitor that

---------21:06----------
makes the L do so that those two caps

---------21:10----------
that were corroded by the CD 3215 so we

---------21:12----------
actually had two separate issues on this

---------21:13----------
board is this not exciting or what folks

---------21:15----------
man are you on the edge of your seat

---------21:17----------
right now or what did you not miss this

---------21:19----------
quality television not only was the CD

---------21:22----------
32:15 not turning on because it wasn't

---------21:24----------
getting 3.3 volts from P P 3 P 3

---------21:25----------
underscore g3 hot because it wasn't

---------21:27----------
being enabled by the ISO 93 9 which

---------21:30----------
happened to be dead but after all was

---------21:31----------
enabled we were getting one point 36

---------21:33----------
volts on 233 underscore g3 hot set of

---------21:35----------
3.3 volts on PP 33 underscore g3 hot

---------21:37----------
because of an active short on two

---------21:39----------
capacitors for the LDL and for P P

---------21:41----------
through v3 underscore g3 on itself

---------21:42----------
underneath the CD 3215 oh em gee I'm so

---------21:46----------
excited so now we're gonna put those

---------21:49----------
capacitors back on and we're gonna have

---------21:50----------
a happy working MacBook Cady security in

---------21:52----------
your store no we don't need kiddie

---------21:54----------
security in the new store because unlike

---------21:56----------
the old store this one's gonna have an

---------21:57----------
alarm system alarm system the one thing

---------22:00----------
I knew have to read in the reviews is

---------22:01----------
[ __ ] ADT oh my god they have it's it's

---------22:04----------
crazy that these companies have such

---------22:06----------
great brand name recognition but you can

---------22:07----------
go to them so many websites and just see

---------22:09----------
a thousand one-star reviews because the

---------22:11----------
thing is you know your company's doing

---------22:13----------
something you know your company's doing

---------22:15----------
something wrong when you have a thousand

---------22:17----------
one-star reviews and it's not like you

---------22:19----------
have a thousand one-star reviews - 10

---------22:22----------
million five-star reviews it's like a

---------22:24----------
thousand one-star reviews and a couple

---------22:26----------
good ones weren't you in the field of

---------22:29----------
mounting security systems you know how I

---------22:31----------
have students that will show up to learn

---------22:34----------
board repair and they'll suck and

---------22:36----------
they'll go back to you know doing screen

---------22:38----------
repair and then like stocks or something

---------22:40----------
that's kind of me when it comes to

---------22:42----------
security so yeah did I take a course on

---------22:44----------
access control and security systems yes

---------22:46----------
do I want to install my

---------22:49----------
no camera systems absolutely I'll

---------22:51----------
install my own camera systems but I am

---------22:53----------
no I'm not gonna install my own took AK

---------22:56----------
I'm not going to install my own security

---------22:57----------
alarm not that if I did that I'd like it

---------23:01----------
to actually work I'll put it that way I

---------23:03----------
know what I know and I know what I don't

---------23:05----------
know

---------23:06----------
yeah Oreo doesn't have a job anymore

---------23:07----------
it's important to know what you don't

---------23:09----------
know too many people out there don't

---------23:10----------
know what they don't know I agree but

---------23:11----------
one of the things that I learned from

---------23:12----------
the Eugene scenario is that even if I

---------23:14----------
know what I don't know that I part of me

---------23:17----------
is really duh I want to hire a

---------23:19----------
professional and I want the professional

---------23:21----------
to just do what they're supposed to do

---------23:22----------
without being bothered by me but I

---------23:24----------
because I know I what I don't know but

---------23:26----------
at the same time I have to not be afraid

---------23:28----------
to be a little bit arrogant and think to

---------23:30----------
myself you know what I don't know

---------23:32----------
anything about this topic but I'm still

---------23:34----------
going to push if I think something isn't

---------23:36----------
right and I don't care if that makes me

---------23:37----------
seem like a dick I don't care if that

---------23:39----------
makes me seem like an awful customer or

---------23:42----------
an idiot or or a jackass or whatever I

---------23:46----------
don't care if I look like a [ __ ] and

---------23:47----------
the thing is I'm usually not afraid of

---------23:49----------
looking stupid but what I learned from

---------23:50----------
that experience is I have to be okay

---------23:52----------
with not caring if I look dumb if

---------23:55----------
something doesn't seem right just even

---------23:57----------
in the tiniest way doesn't matter if the

---------23:59----------
people around you that know more than

---------24:02----------
you on the topic are telling you it's

---------24:03----------
right if you genuinely believe it's not

---------24:05----------
right then just [ __ ] go with that gut

---------24:07----------
feeling anyway that being said let's see

---------24:10----------
if I get a screen going on here you'll

---------24:12----------
see that we've booted into an operating

---------24:14----------
system there so this machine is indeed

---------24:17----------
working so we had two separate issues

---------24:20----------
with this MacBook that we were able to

---------24:21----------
resolve the first issue was that the PP

---------24:24----------
3b3 underscore g3 hot rail was not

---------24:27----------
turning on because it was missing its

---------24:28----------
enable signal and as a result of missing

---------24:30----------
its enable signal from a broken ISO nine

---------24:31----------
239 the USB C port controller it

---------24:34----------
requires PP 3300 g3 hot to work the CD

---------24:36----------
32 15 Co zero zero was not speaking to

---------24:38----------
the charger in requesting 20 volts

---------24:40----------
rather than five volts we got five volts

---------24:42----------
on the USBC ammeter the secondary issue

---------24:44----------
that we were having is that P P 33

---------24:45----------
undersquare g3 huh

---------24:47----------
powers the CD 32 15 which then powers in

---------24:49----------
LDL inside the CD 32 15 which allows the

---------24:52----------
CD 32 team to create another little

---------24:54----------
power rail for itself and that was being

---------24:56----------
shorted to ground through a capacitor

---------24:58----------
that was mildly corroded on the other

---------24:59----------
side of the board once knocked off the

---------25:01----------
machine didn't

---------25:02----------
work and did boot do keep in mind that

---------25:04----------
if you have a 2019 or a 2020 MacBook Pro

---------25:08----------
the only way that I could perform the

---------25:10----------
repair that I did here is to purchase an

---------25:12----------
iPhone 10 our charging case from Apple

---------25:16----------
for $129 take the chip off waste 10

---------25:19----------
minutes reball you then take that $129

---------25:21----------
battery case which includes a

---------25:24----------
lithium-ion battery and a PCB and throw

---------25:27----------
it straight in the e-waste in the trash

---------25:28----------
where it's going to be disposed of and

---------25:30----------
99.9% of what's in that is most likely

---------25:33----------
not going to be recycled just disposed

---------25:35----------
of or set on fire and some trash heap in

---------25:37----------
Africa also that Tim Cook can have just

---------25:43----------
a little bit more money that's why we go

---------25:48----------
for right to repair that's it for today

---------25:50----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------25:52----------
something

---------25:52----------
thank you for watching and I'll see you

---------25:54----------
in the next video
