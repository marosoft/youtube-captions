---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going today we're

---------00:01----------
gonna get started working on yet another

---------00:03----------
dead macbook this is an a 1706 that has

---------00:06----------
liquid damage let's open it up and see

---------00:08----------
if we can figure out why it's not

---------00:09----------
working and make it turn on again first

---------00:13----------
thing we got to do take the bottom cover

---------00:15----------
off of the computer

---------00:16----------
do you have Apple toilet paper in your

---------00:18----------
online store I wish I had toilet paper

---------00:21----------
in my store we didn't stock up in time

---------00:24----------
no what is this CD 3215 corroded the

---------00:36----------
battery sticker is on top of the CPU why

---------00:41----------
32:15 corrosion and these are

---------00:44----------
under-filled CD 32 15 s as well with any

---------00:46----------
luck it'll just be a short to ground on

---------00:48----------
the cam next to it nothing at all USB a

---------00:52----------
meter register zero doesn't register

---------00:54----------
anything actually it doesn't even think

---------00:56----------
I plugged anything in let's see what it

---------00:59----------
does on the other side of the board on

---------01:00----------
the other side of the board we get 5

---------01:03----------
volts at 300 milliamps and it doesn't

---------01:08----------
appear to jump up to 20 for those of you

---------01:10----------
who have problems reading upside down

---------01:13----------
look at that you just tap it twice and

---------01:15----------
by Bing baboom okay so the issue that we

---------01:19----------
appear to be having here is that it

---------01:20----------
stays at 5 volts which is understandable

---------01:24----------
given the amount of corrosion we have on

---------01:25----------
our USB C chip ok so the first thing is

---------01:28----------
you may have noticed the charge port

---------01:29----------
worked on the right half way but not on

---------01:31----------
the left this is what the charge board

---------01:33----------
on the left looks like that is one

---------01:35----------
corona DUP charge port oh man now the

---------01:39----------
main corrosion that troubles me is this

---------01:41----------
so remember folks anybody who's watching

---------01:44----------
out there at home on your television

---------01:46----------
sets that we need PP 3 V 3 underscore g3

---------01:49----------
hot to be present and if PP 3 V 3

---------01:53----------
underscore g3 hot is not present then

---------01:57----------
that this chip over here is not going to

---------02:00----------
speak to the charger and it's not going

---------02:02----------
to ask for the 20 volts that is needed

---------02:05----------
for this computer to turn on so what I'd

---------02:07----------
like to check and see is is pp 3 V 3

---------02:12----------
underscore

---------02:13----------
three hot actually present now some of

---------02:16----------
these capacitors that happen to have

---------02:17----------
heavy amounts of corrosion on them these

---------02:20----------
are the capacitors that have PP through

---------02:21----------
four three underscore g3 hot on them

---------02:23----------
which may leads me to believe that

---------02:24----------
perhaps the problem is that BP 3v3

---------02:27----------
underscore g3 hot doesn't exist as being

---------02:29----------
a short circuited to ground the best way

---------02:31----------
to figure that out is with a measurement

---------02:33----------
now it's a steady three point four very

---------02:36----------
interesting it's had a scrape at a

---------02:38----------
little bit point nine three point three

---------02:42----------
yeah no that's not what's messed up but

---------02:45----------
it's jumping I wonder if maybe there is

---------02:48----------
a minor short-circuit like a half short

---------02:53----------
piece of [ __ ] piece of sheet [ __ ] and

---------03:00----------
come on come on

---------03:15----------
go

---------03:18----------
and crap acid

---------03:22----------
perhaps this debug resistor is more

---------03:24----------
important than I give it credit for

---------03:53----------
[Music]

---------04:37----------
now the resistor that's gonna go there

---------04:38----------
is 1 million ohms you have any concept

---------04:44----------
of how many homes 1 million ohms are if

---------04:49----------
Michael Bloomberg gave 1 million ohms to

---------04:53----------
everybody in the United States we'd all

---------04:55----------
be a millionaire

---------05:03----------
[Applause]

---------05:36----------
still 330 milliamps at five volts and

---------05:41----------
then turns off kinda curious with the

---------05:46----------
resistance to ground on the good old P P

---------05:48----------
buses alright thousands of owns that's

---------05:52----------
good

---------06:10----------
[Applause]

---------07:17----------
all right now we have a ROM chip above

---------07:19----------
this CD 32 15 and I believe we found our

---------07:22----------
problem see that

---------07:28----------
[Music]

---------07:29----------
see these two resistors here there you

---------07:34----------
go now what I just showed you there take

---------07:40----------
a look on the schematic and the board

---------07:41----------
view it's gonna rotate it

---------07:50----------
thunderbolt rom RB 0 9 0 is going to be

---------07:56----------
a 3.3 kilohm resistor and the resistor

---------08:00----------
next to it is going to be a 100 ohm

---------08:03----------
resistor and what was that connected to

---------08:08----------
nothing

---------08:36----------
[Music]

---------09:05----------
I really need my micro pencil back some

---------09:26----------
alright so I'm gonna take out my

---------09:28----------
resistor booklet let's start off with a

---------09:31----------
3.3 kiloohm resistor gravity does not

---------09:38----------
work when coronavirus pandemic hits

---------09:44----------
these types of heights you'll notice

---------09:47----------
that some of the basic laws of physics

---------09:48----------
cease to operate one of them is gravity

---------09:54----------
see how the resistor doesn't drop on its

---------09:56----------
own anymore

---------10:03----------
okay I'm gonna put that down

---------10:11----------
using these shitty hot tweezers

---------10:25----------
this is so annoying

---------10:45----------
all right the next resistor I believe

---------10:47----------
was a 100 ohm resistor

---------10:58----------
yes 100 ohms goes next to it so that

---------11:01----------
looping that we saw is most likely the

---------11:04----------
result of it trying to read the ROM

---------11:05----------
failing to read the rom and turning off

---------11:07----------
so now I know what that is

---------11:09----------
see that's the beautiful part about

---------11:11----------
corrosion it allows and this is why

---------11:13----------
pattern recognition is so important it's

---------11:14----------
not like there's a book written that

---------11:16----------
says how all these things work out

---------11:17----------
rather you just kind of figure it out as

---------11:20----------
you go so I that I found out there was a

---------11:23----------
corroded resistor on the ROM and the

---------11:28----------
issue I was having prior to that was

---------11:30----------
stuck at five volts it stays that it

---------11:32----------
turns on with 300 milliamps for a few

---------11:35----------
seconds and then it turned the charger

---------11:37----------
turns off so when I have that problem

---------11:39----------
now what I do is I deduce that that

---------11:42----------
problem occurred when the resistor to

---------11:46----------
the ROM chip for thunderbolt wasn't

---------11:48----------
there so now I what I do is I have to

---------11:50----------
think and the thinking is very important

---------11:52----------
you're gonna to try and figure out for

---------11:53----------
your own without it being written down

---------11:55----------
anywhere without there being a manual

---------11:57----------
why why did that occur what what is the

---------12:02----------
relation that these two things have are

---------12:04----------
they related at all and I believe they

---------12:08----------
are and if this fixes the problem then

---------12:10----------
I'll have that relation to my head that

---------12:12----------
when the thunderbolt rom is corrupt or

---------12:15----------
just not there that you get 5 volts 300

---------12:20----------
Mel amps for 3 seconds and then it

---------12:22----------
doesn't just not go to 20 volts it

---------12:24----------
reboots itself but remember this is just

---------12:29----------
a theory at the moment

---------12:32----------
not a reality and oh [ __ ] I almost

---------12:35----------
ripped that freaking fat I really don't

---------12:40----------
like hot tweezers I can't wait to find

---------12:44----------
my micro pencil back okay now I'm gonna

---------12:48----------
see if I get any change when I plug this

---------12:50----------
in or is it the exact same [ __ ] 19.5

---------12:55----------
it's working now I just I just ruined my

---------12:58----------
overhead camera in the middle of this

---------12:59----------
damn video so I can't show you it and

---------13:01----------
the Oh doing that in the overhead camera

---------13:03----------
you could see nineteen point five volts

---------13:06----------
so we are getting somewhere here we are

---------13:10----------
getting somewhere here it turns on 5

---------13:13----------
volts 330ml amps 19 volts 400ml amps 19

---------13:22----------
volts 500 milliamps 19 volts 400

---------13:25----------
milliamps 19 volts 250 MLMs

---------13:29----------
19 volts 300 mil arms 19 volts 200

---------13:32----------
milliamps and then it goes to 10 then it

---------13:34----------
goes back and reboots to 340 MLMs

---------13:37----------
you know what just to show you all the

---------13:39----------
here I messed up my overhead camera but

---------13:41----------
I'll show you that it works in the main

---------13:44----------
camera by just plugging it in aha okay

---------13:48----------
so this machine is booted as you can see

---------13:50----------
here so the issue here was that we had

---------13:54----------
corrosion around the USBC chip the USBC

---------13:58----------
MUX now the main corrosion that I saw

---------14:01----------
was not the corrosion that actually

---------14:03----------
mattered the corrosion on the 3.3 volt

---------14:04----------
power line that's going to power that I

---------14:07----------
see the real corrosion that mattered was

---------14:09----------
the corrosion around the Thunderbolt ROM

---------14:11----------
so now I learned something so the

---------14:12----------
Thunderbolt ROM chip has resistors going

---------14:15----------
to it and when they were corroded I had

---------14:18----------
it turned on and give me 5 volts 4 5 4 3

---------14:21----------
2 1 seconds at 300 milliamps and then it

---------14:24----------
shuts trade off so now I know if it's

---------14:26----------
taking 5 volts or 5 seconds and then

---------14:28----------
just boot loops on me like that not boot

---------14:29----------
loops immediately 5 volts 300 milliamps

---------14:31----------
five seconds turns off ROM issue and the

---------14:34----------
way you figure that out is with pattern

---------14:36----------
recognition have a detective's mindset

---------14:38----------
and pattern recognition it's not written

---------14:40----------
down there's no manual that says that

---------14:41----------
this is how this works you just gotta

---------14:43----------
use your brain and if you want to dive

---------14:45----------
in

---------14:45----------
use your brain just a little bit every

---------14:47----------
now and then you can fix a MacBook I'm

---------14:50----------
gonna put those two capacitors back on

---------14:52----------
that I tossed off with a little MacBook

---------14:55----------
and once they're back on a little

---------14:57----------
MacBook I can give this back to the

---------14:59----------
customer and then I can collect some

---------15:02----------
money and I'll put that money towards my

---------15:07----------
seventy five thousand dollar credit card

---------15:09----------
bill isn't moving to Anubis base in New

---------15:13----------
York City just great and all right so

---------15:16----------
let's find a donor with those two little

---------15:19----------
capacitors buy it I Love New York

---------15:42----------
obviously this cap is semi optional

---------15:44----------
seeing that it turned on and booted up

---------15:46----------
perfectly without it but the nice thing

---------15:50----------
to do is to put it back

---------16:32----------
these hot tweezers are as useless as

---------16:34----------
tits on a bull I swear you know what

---------16:38----------
that can stay nice and crooked that

---------16:45----------
resistors gonna stay crooked I got this

---------16:47----------
one review on Yelp and Google or he says

---------16:49----------
Apple would have never put something

---------16:50----------
there and that's crooked so yep

---------16:55----------
Apple also was gonna charge you fifteen

---------16:57----------
hundred dollars and tell you no data

---------16:58----------
suck my dick

---------17:00----------
right now really these hot razors are so

---------17:04----------
[ __ ] beyond useless for this I have

---------17:07----------
to steal my micro pencil back from David

---------17:09----------
this is this is gonna happen I'm taking

---------17:13----------
that micro pencil I know that he never

---------17:15----------
uses it anyway

---------17:23----------
all right that's good that'll last

---------17:36----------
beautiful nice and crooked crooked just

---------17:39----------
like apple
