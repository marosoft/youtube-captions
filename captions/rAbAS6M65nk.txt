---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna be

---------00:01----------
working on I'm cleaning out my slots

---------00:03----------
here because I'm piling everything in

---------00:04----------
the slots in the front and I'm almost

---------00:06----------
done using both cases in the front and I

---------00:09----------
didn't notice that a lot of the stuff

---------00:10----------
that's been in here has been here for

---------00:12----------
like two years so I'm cleaning out all

---------00:14----------
the garbage and I'm here at one of my

---------00:17----------
one of my no fixes from back when we

---------00:20----------
used to outsource board repair and you

---------00:23----------
there was so much neater with the wires

---------00:25----------
than I was man like look at look at look

---------00:27----------
at the beauty of these wires like see

---------00:29----------
that just run around the board nicely

---------00:32----------
the wires are all nice and taut and it's

---------00:37----------
nothing like yeah it's nothing like the

---------00:39----------
garbage I do now anyways let's take a

---------00:42----------
look around this beautiful board so you

---------00:44----------
can see just how beautiful it is so you

---------00:51----------
just get my microscope and focus for me

---------00:53----------
and then after that I'll get it in focus

---------00:55----------
for for you hopefully my longer hdmi

---------01:00----------
cord will make it easier for this to

---------01:01----------
stop getting up I just got them

---------01:04----------
in Amazon today I haven't had time to

---------01:06----------
plug them in you

---------01:07----------
there we go so

---------01:15----------
is that pretty or what

---------01:20----------
yeah that's pretty this is a beautiful

---------01:23----------
looking board this is the 2915 so even

---------01:26----------
if we do manage to make this piece of

---------01:29----------
 work again yeah look at that look

---------01:33----------
at that this may actually die of natural

---------01:42----------
causes rather than graphics chip so

---------01:47----------
let's see what what my what my problems

---------01:50----------
are here so I'm gonna plug it in and

---------01:54----------
let's see if I get a light on the

---------01:55----------
charger as you can barely see no light

---------02:04----------
in the charger and no fan spinning so

---------02:08----------
the first thing we need in order to get

---------02:09----------
a light in the charger is PP 3 V 4 2 so

---------02:12----------
let's take a measure and see if that's

---------02:14----------
present so on this board PP 3 V 4 2 is

---------02:21----------
gonna be on this big coil over here and

---------02:24----------
we have none so now the next thing I do

---------02:27----------
if I have no power on output is I check

---------02:29----------
for a short two grounds on an output so

---------02:32----------
I go on a diode mode in the meter read

---------02:34----------
probe on ground black probe on output as

---------02:36----------
you can see no short to ground so now

---------02:39----------
what I'm gonna do next as I checked the

---------02:41----------
end of the circuit for a short to ground

---------02:43----------
and also for voltage now I'm going to

---------02:45----------
check the beginning of this of that

---------02:46----------
circuit so I have 16 volts going in

---------02:51----------
alright so now let's open it up on the

---------02:53----------
schematics we have 16 volts going in

---------02:54----------
nothing coming out and no short to

---------02:57----------
ground so let's see if we can paint a

---------03:00----------
picture of what this means so I'm gonna

---------03:02----------
open up the schematic at the end of my

---------03:05----------
way I twisted this again I need to cut

---------03:09----------
hook up the longer cables I got him

---------03:12----------
because when I was moving the salmo off

---------03:13----------
that desk to clean that desk up I may

---------03:17----------
have may or may not have dropped his

---------03:18----------
ammo on all the cables and the splitter

---------03:21----------
I hope it's the cables that are being

---------03:23----------
finicky and not the splitter cuz that

---------03:25----------
would suck if it was display

---------03:27----------
so let's go over to PP three before to

---------03:30----------
regulator on this board here we go hue

---------03:34----------
six nine nine something all right so

---------03:38----------
here's what I have so over here on input

---------03:42----------
I have 16 volts this is output and I

---------03:45----------
have zero so let's take a look at the

---------03:48----------
use 6900 area and see if anything looks

---------03:52----------
funky and on this board everything looks

---------03:55----------
funky it's nine nine zero because that's

---------04:01----------
gonna be right over here it's a now

---------04:05----------
let's just get on the microscope and

---------04:12----------
okay so I'm gonna give you guys a few

---------04:15----------
seconds to tell me what's wrong with

---------04:17----------
this what's wrong with this board that's

---------04:20----------
been sitting in my slot for over two

---------04:23----------
years now

---------04:28----------
okay now see how this over here and

---------04:31----------
unplug it for this that's a flat pad

---------04:33----------
flat pad flat pad flat pad a little bit

---------04:37----------
of solder a little bit over here this

---------04:39----------
was knocked off so let's see what that's

---------04:42----------
for in the schematic so here alright so

---------04:46----------
here we have the piece that's missing

---------04:47----------
are 6 9 9 5 1 million ohm resistor

---------04:50----------
between main input and T o n now teo n

---------04:54----------
stands for time on so this is a buck

---------04:56----------
converter I see even though you can't

---------04:58----------
see it the switching transistors are

---------05:00----------
although all that stuff is done inside

---------05:01----------
the chip now the idea here is that this

---------05:03----------
can be powered by the power adapter 18

---------05:06----------
point 5 volts or pp bus g3 hot the

---------05:08----------
battery which is twelve point six volts

---------05:09----------
but it's always gonna output the same

---------05:12----------
amount 3.42 volts it's gonna output 3.42

---------05:15----------
regardless of whether the input is the

---------05:17----------
battery at 12 or the charger at 18 so it

---------05:20----------
has to stay on for a different amount of

---------05:22----------
time to get to the three point four

---------05:23----------
volts if you have spikes of 18 volts you

---------05:26----------
need less of them which means this chip

---------05:28----------
has to stay on for a lower period of

---------05:29----------
time to get down to three point four

---------05:31----------
then if you were using the battery so

---------05:34----------
this resistor is going to be between the

---------05:35----------
input source and here to let know how

---------05:38----------
much time it should stay on

---------05:39----------
for in that resistor is not here and

---------05:43----------
because that resistor is not here this

---------05:45----------
board sat in the bin for two

---------05:47----------
years great because that that's the way

---------05:50----------
this works and it's anything that that

---------05:51----------
actually belongs to me is is always on

---------05:53----------
the lowest lowest priority in the pile

---------05:57----------
computer regular customers stuff goes

---------06:00----------
first in the problem it's my fault cuz

---------06:02----------
you know I don't call to and ask

---------06:04----------
for status updates on myself so I never

---------06:06----------
work on my own stuff so let's replace

---------06:08----------
this thing and pray that the rest of

---------06:15----------
this works

---------06:21----------
what do you think the chances all the

---------06:22----------
rest of this will work Jason did I show

---------06:24----------
you it look at this I don't know what

---------06:31----------
that is but it's it's everywhere look at

---------06:34----------
this look at this board it's growing

---------06:37----------


---------06:44----------
I'm gonna sell this to somebody on the

---------06:46----------
weekend and tell them you get support

---------06:48----------
from micro citing supply.com

---------06:54----------
has the website still making a bunch of

---------06:57----------
orders

---------07:09----------
the board I'm trying to take this chip

---------07:11----------
off of this freezing cold it's it was

---------07:14----------
all the donors for the 2915 we're

---------07:16----------
sitting right underneath an

---------07:17----------
air-conditioning vent luckily I have the

---------07:21----------
JBC on my side

---------07:34----------
now with any luck the graphics chip

---------07:36----------
didn't die this has been sitting this is

---------07:39----------
the 29:15 and has been sitting in the

---------07:40----------
slot for two years I'm not even going to

---------07:50----------
try plugging this into a screen because

---------07:51----------
that that's gonna ruin my high moment so

---------07:53----------
that's about that so there was a missing

---------07:57----------
time on resistor and that does have to

---------07:59----------
be present so that the machine knows how

---------08:01----------
long so that the regulator knows how

---------08:04----------
long to stay on because remember if you

---------08:06----------
have 18 if you're trying to turn 18 into

---------08:08----------
3 you need less 18 volt pulses to make 3

---------08:11----------
then you need 12 volt pulses to make 3

---------08:13----------
so that's about that for today and as

---------08:16----------
always I hope you learn something can

---------08:18----------
you believe this turns on Oh Mike

---------08:20----------
this is nuts

---------08:22----------
ah what do you think the chances of the

---------08:27----------
graphics chip actually works Jason yeah

---------08:34----------
if this thing runs really really hot

---------08:38----------
like really really hot yeah it looks

---------08:44----------
like the PCH has been reflow the

---------08:47----------
graphics chip I'd like to say the word

---------08:48----------
replaced but no way in hell they

---------08:51----------
replaced it so the graphics chip on this

---------08:52----------
is probably refloat it's missing all the

---------08:55----------
ground plane I kind of want to plug it

---------09:00----------
in I got to see this this you do

---------09:03----------
anything doesn't even light up a USB

---------09:05----------
mouse I'll be amazed if it lights up the

---------09:07----------
USB mouse alright the suspense is

---------09:13----------
killing me

---------09:25----------
this couldn't look more like if a

---------09:27----------
tribe alrightso plug it in let's see if

---------09:33----------
we can get to a question mark

---------09:44----------
I forgot the 2915 s all turn on and off

---------09:47----------
and then on

---------09:59----------
Jason I get no picture on the screen

---------10:18----------
maybe it's a bad screen maybe my tester

---------10:21----------
screen is not working yeah let's see

---------10:30----------
let's see if it even sees a USB mouse

---------10:35----------
can you even post yeah my USB mouse

---------10:43----------
lights up interesting when I touch it it

---------10:51----------
magically turns off it looks like the

---------10:57----------
MUX has been refloat on this as well

---------11:03----------
this is worse than a sunny board

---------11:13----------
okay I was about to measure something

---------11:15----------
and I forget now turn it back on measure

---------11:20----------
voltage at LCD connector would you like

---------11:24----------
to turn back on board it doesn't want to

---------11:27----------
turn back on come on

---------11:41----------
it's not that hot anymore

---------11:50----------
it doesn't want to turn on anymore

---------12:00----------
and peepee Bush g3 hot is down a 1 point

---------12:03----------
7 volts well that sounds like a short to

---------12:09----------
ground hmm wouldn't it be interesting if

---------12:15----------
a GPU fed yeah there's a great there's a

---------12:17----------
short to ground on PP but g3 high oh boy

---------12:20----------
that's I wonder if it happens to be a

---------12:24----------
graphics chip fat or inside the board

---------12:31----------
seriously this thing's been on for all

---------12:33----------
of like 30 seconds and it's already

---------12:34----------
 all right how long are the wires

---------12:41----------
on your power supply I'll do it on that

---------12:46----------
soon

---------12:47----------
no no 20 you know I just I want to what

---------12:51----------
if I were the shortest Oh bring it over

---------12:55----------
there

---------13:03----------
you

---------15:37----------
I'm not sure how long I was talking

---------15:38----------
without remember

---------15:40----------
gone back in I don't think he missed

---------15:43----------
anything great I found out where the

---------15:45----------
short-circuit was I used the I used

---------15:51----------
Jason's table too to find it because the

---------15:55----------
power supply is on his table I found out

---------15:58----------
it was that transistor it wasn't the

---------15:59----------
caps on the other side I was being an

---------16:01----------
idiot and now we're gonna put back the

---------16:03----------
caps that I removed while I was being an

---------16:04----------
idiot that Adam made no sense with no

---------16:09----------
audio bonus points if you were following

---------16:12----------
along though

---------16:29----------
so now I'm just taking these caps off

---------16:31----------
the donor board but the donor board is

---------16:33----------
called I have to turn around the

---------16:36----------
air-conditioning then it's really

---------16:40----------
counterproductive that an

---------16:41----------
air-conditioning vent is blowing on the

---------16:42----------
board that I'm reflow in trying to get

---------16:47----------
pieces off okay that will flow in a

---------16:51----------
place you'll see

---------17:32----------
these boards absorb a particular amount

---------17:34----------
of heat it's an organ dissipate tansy

---------18:00----------
yeah this is going to be a fan in the

---------18:02----------
answer

---------18:08----------
that that was if that was an annoying

---------18:11----------
thing to have happen

---------18:12----------
my captors flew away

---------18:22----------
I think I'm just gonna take them all off

---------18:24----------
at once

---------19:16----------
I can add flux and make sure everything

---------19:18----------
looks nice on reflowing it later

---------19:28----------
okay I need to get the one that I lost

---------19:30----------
now off another donor let's see I should

---------19:39----------
have won here

---------20:17----------
let's take so long

---------20:39----------
all right final cap

---------21:30----------
all right one way to see if we let's see

---------21:33----------
do we still have a short circuit to

---------21:35----------
ground here I'm just gonna check on my

---------21:39----------
meter

---------21:45----------
sure it's gone just clear off the solder

---------21:49----------
bridge I made on the fuse can't believe

---------21:54----------
them spending time on this board I do

---------21:59----------
want to clean out all the stuff here

---------22:01----------
like if it's if it can be fixed great if

---------22:04----------
it can't be fixed it's tossed in the

---------22:07----------
 pile but I just want to categorize

---------22:08----------
it kind of everything in one place so

---------22:21----------
it's plug in a screen

---------22:28----------
and pray

---------22:40----------
fans are spinning fans are not spinning

---------22:48----------
come on you can do it boot

---------22:59----------
and mere pieces you have a ribald GPU

---------23:07----------
don't you that was what I was gonna

---------23:12----------
measure before the FET died yeah this is

---------23:15----------
this for this one's I also

---------23:17----------
noticed that start recording said stop

---------23:19----------
stop according to the star which means I

---------23:21----------
probably missed a clip but yeah it's

---------23:23----------
 on the screen the CPU got 12

---------23:28----------
volts rest in pieces
