---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going today I'm

---------00:02----------
gonna be working on an a 1707 it's not

---------00:04----------
powering on let's open this MacBook up

---------00:06----------
take a look on the inside of it and see

---------00:08----------
if we can figure out why it's not

---------00:09----------
powering it on fix it and make it work

---------00:11----------
again all right

---------00:13----------
so what we have here is a machine that

---------00:15----------
has a t2 chip zero corrosion whatsoever

---------00:21----------
none looks perfectly clean no liquid no

---------00:29----------
blown up capacitors so what I do with

---------00:33----------
all these machines as I unplug the

---------00:35----------
battery I plug in the charger with the

---------00:40----------
amp meter and let's see how much it's

---------00:42----------
taking 5 volts 300 milliamps 400,000

---------00:51----------
homes to ground on PP bus g3 huh so we

---------00:54----------
don't have a short to ground on a PT bus

---------00:56----------
next CD 32 15 ship let's see if that PP

---------01:01----------
3 v3 whatever the hell rel is present

---------01:04----------
there we go this one are you sure it's a

---------01:07----------
ground

---------01:10----------
okay let's kill ohms

---------01:12----------
it's not showing the K on the screen

---------01:14----------
probably miss cropped it but 36 kilohms

---------01:16----------
that's not that's not a serious problem

---------01:19----------
here

---------01:24----------
okay we're still when I plug it in we're

---------01:26----------
still taking 300 milliamps 3.3 volts on

---------01:30----------
PP 3 V 3 there is nothing even slightly

---------01:36----------
corroded here

---------01:44----------
now the cd32 15's would be responsible

---------01:46----------
for getting us up to 20 volts but they

---------01:49----------
look to be totally fine and in this

---------01:51----------
machine they speaks tutitu chip you know

---------01:56----------
what yeah

---------01:59----------
bane of my existence right here

---------02:13----------
what do the notes say maybe it'll give

---------02:17----------
us an idea some history perhaps

---------02:19----------
something we can use to learn and

---------02:24----------
understand the issue right after

---------02:26----------
executing the latest security update the

---------02:28----------
computer died hmm corrupt e to farm

---------02:34----------
where's his PR enough so yeah what are

---------02:36----------
you doing with the firmware when the

---------02:37----------
thing won't even turn on well like yeah

---------02:40----------
corrupt t2 firmware this too got a DFU

---------02:43----------
it well what do you do when the thing is

---------02:44----------
stuck at 5 volts how are you even

---------02:46----------
getting into DFU mode when it's stuck in

---------02:48----------
5 volts I'm gonna give this as a present

---------02:50----------
to Chris see if we had a camera outside

---------02:53----------
I'll be able to show you the look on his

---------02:54----------
face when we hand this to him so you

---------02:56----------
have d fut2 machine oh wow so I can stop

---------03:01----------
getting yeah I've been running scared

---------03:03----------
from those for the past three months

---------03:04----------
when they're perfectly clean 5 volts

---------03:06----------
12.5 PP busted just yeah

---------03:09----------
and how many worked so you're saying

---------03:14----------
that this you can destroy the entire

---------03:16----------
hardware of the Machine through an

---------03:17----------
operating system update yeah how the

---------03:21----------
[ __ ] it's on 20 books and 0.5 amps and I

---------03:45----------
don't

---------03:46----------
a small ray single can you show how we

---------03:54----------
do this can we make a video of this you

---------03:58----------
I make video but you okay I'll be you be

---------04:01----------
the brain I'd be the English Oh deal we

---------04:06----------
need somebody attractive to be the face

---------04:07----------
stuff let's do it video you're gonna be

---------04:11----------
famous

---------04:12----------
okay I'll be faint you tell me what this

---------04:18----------
okay I show on camera you do you

---------04:22----------
translate between the three of us for

---------04:25----------
one youtuber parent okay folks I'm gonna

---------04:28----------
show you what to do this is an issue

---------04:30----------
that's been driving me nuts for quite a

---------04:31----------
while because I'm an idiot I didn't

---------04:33----------
realize that this was something that's

---------04:35----------
fairly easily fixable by putting the

---------04:37----------
machine and do off DFU mode and

---------04:39----------
connecting it to another machine okay so

---------04:41----------
here's the machine this is a very common

---------04:43----------
issue where it's taking five volts on

---------04:45----------
the charge port but P P bus g3 hot is

---------04:47----------
twelve point three to twelve point five

---------04:48----------
volts so what we're gonna do in the

---------04:51----------
machine is totally clean no liquid

---------04:52----------
damage no short-circuit on the board so

---------04:54----------
we're gonna take a USB cable and we're

---------04:57----------
going to plug in our other computer that

---------04:59----------
we have that we use for this over here

---------05:00----------
this is uh yeah so and we're gonna run

---------05:04----------
this program this is Apple configurator

---------05:06----------
to which I believe you can get from the

---------05:09----------
App Store so now I'm gonna plug this in

---------05:11----------
and how do you choose which port you

---------05:12----------
plug this into so you have to plug it

---------05:14----------
into the master port so now once I've

---------05:16----------
plugged it in see this computer I have

---------05:19----------
plugged in with a USB CD USBC cable you

---------05:21----------
can buy these on on Amazon for like

---------05:23----------
twelve bucks the original Apple one and

---------05:25----------
I get this on the screen so once I see

---------05:27----------
this on the screen what I do is double

---------05:32----------
click there of course I'm totally not

---------05:36----------
taking credit for the Polish genius

---------05:38----------
behind me that's doing all of this for

---------05:39----------
me I would never do that

---------05:45----------
now so we go to action then we click

---------05:48----------
restore and now it is restoring it

---------05:55----------
yeah that means it's seeing the t2

---------05:57----------
that's communicating with it and bumping

---------06:00----------
back the firmware to whatever this has

---------06:03----------
which is probably an older version

---------06:08----------
and all right now we're gonna try it

---------06:10----------
with a charger plugged in now let's try

---------06:20----------
that again with it plugged into the

---------06:21----------
charger

---------06:31----------
it's taking longer than before when it

---------06:33----------
failed so I'm hoping that means success

---------06:39----------
whoa okay

---------06:42----------
so it says installing OS now it's not

---------06:44----------
done yet with installing the OS but if

---------06:47----------
you take a look this machine that before

---------06:49----------
was not booting at all with stuck at 5

---------06:51----------
volts is now giving us an Apple logo on

---------06:54----------
the screen a progress bar and the fan is

---------06:56----------
spinning ok actually after a few minutes

---------07:00----------
you will get an error over here because

---------07:04----------
this is an apple so that you have to

---------07:10----------
turn off this machine this one no

---------07:15----------
because you can't do another DFU mode so

---------07:23----------
it locks to one DFU mode you have to

---------07:25----------
restart the machine because they won't

---------07:27----------
be what you do what happens so this

---------07:30----------
machine know that is Linde of you for

---------07:32----------
this machine huh won't let you plug in

---------07:34----------
another machine into it cuz it'll just

---------07:36----------
air out so you have to restart that

---------07:37----------
clear out so it clears all its cache

---------07:39----------
isn't and when that's fresh and turned

---------07:40----------
on again you can do another machine wait

---------07:45----------
so this is just gonna stay at installing

---------07:46----------
OS forever yeah yeah you can actually we

---------07:51----------
have to wait for it but for this last

---------07:59----------
piece and see if it boots into an

---------08:00----------
operating system

---------08:39----------
what is it installing from this or is

---------08:51----------
installing from its itself 38 minutes

---------08:56----------
remaining so basically whatever update

---------08:59----------
failed is probably happening right now

---------09:00----------
because we reverted the update and I was

---------09:03----------
gonna try to update itself with a

---------09:05----------
working update hopefully with this

---------09:17----------
nothing so this is the machine that we

---------09:19----------
used to do the DFU mode is Accra physis

---------09:24----------
we can't you can't close yeah you can't

---------09:31----------
this is like a praying mantis when it

---------09:33----------
has sex and then the female eats its

---------09:34----------
head yeah yeah fine I'm doing for sweet

---------09:42----------
Donna yeah

---------09:45----------
and actually no because we go here we

---------09:49----------
see still old Apple control of

---------09:54----------
controller from this is so [ __ ] buggy

---------09:58----------
never refreshed yeah so we'll see if

---------10:02----------
that works shortly yeah thank you very

---------10:04----------
much Chris any time with that being said

---------10:07----------
I can edit you out of the video and

---------10:08----------
pretend I came up with this on my own

---------10:10----------
nobody will be the wiser all right so

---------10:13----------
we'll come back in 28 minutes to figure

---------10:14----------
out what's going on with that machine

---------10:16----------
okay back to this computer that we had

---------10:18----------
over here so it just finished updating

---------10:20----------
it actually took about 38 minutes but it

---------10:23----------
finally finished

---------10:25----------
you got the Apple logo on the screen

---------10:28----------
here and it booted and you can see the

---------10:32----------
image over there I'm just covering their

---------10:34----------
name it boots and you know trackpad

---------10:37----------
works

---------10:37----------
fan is spinning screen is on so that's

---------10:41----------
about it so very often you'll have this

---------10:43----------
problem with the t2 chip MacBook Pros

---------10:46----------
where the machine will just will have

---------10:50----------
five volts on a USBC charger

---------10:52----------
it'll be taking drawing 300 milliamps

---------10:54----------
but not turning on a PP but g3 huh will

---------10:57----------
be present there'll be no corrosion

---------10:59----------
anywhere on the board and often it's

---------11:01----------
just corrupt t2 we way that you fix this

---------11:04----------
is you can download that little tool you

---------11:06----------
have to install it on another one of

---------11:08----------
these machines so we have an office a

---------11:10----------
1989 over there that we installed it on

---------11:13----------
then you run the little program as we

---------11:15----------
showed before you have this machine

---------11:17----------
plugged in on the other end it's going

---------11:19----------
to turn on it's gonna reboot once it's

---------11:21----------
going to say it failed it's gonna go

---------11:23----------
through with the update again and it's

---------11:24----------
gonna take about 28 minutes for that

---------11:26----------
process it'll say it failed the second

---------11:28----------
time you hit restart and then it just

---------11:30----------
boots up into the operating system and

---------11:31----------
it works

---------11:32----------
why does this happen randomly Apple why

---------11:35----------
is it that when you bring it to the

---------11:36----------
store they say you're gonna have to pay

---------11:37----------
about over a thousand dollars to fix it

---------11:39----------
Apple Apple Apple that's it for today

---------11:46----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------11:48----------
something this was a nightmare but now

---------11:51----------
it's not because we know what's wrong

---------11:52----------
with it

---------11:53----------
I didn't figure this thing out either

---------11:55----------
the other guy who works here did one of

---------11:57----------
the things that makes me really happy is

---------11:58----------
that I've gotten to this

---------11:59----------
the point of success at my company where

---------12:01----------
I can hire people smarter than me to

---------12:02----------
just figure things out it's great I

---------12:04----------
don't have to use my brain anymore I

---------12:06----------
could use his brain this is this great

---------12:08----------
feeling when you build something that

---------12:09----------
moved that goes far beyond yourself and

---------12:11----------
I just I don't have words to describe it

---------12:13----------
there are people working here that are

---------12:15----------
considerably smarter than me they just

---------12:16----------
figure things out on their own and then

---------12:18----------
teach me it's beautiful

---------12:19----------
very humble and grateful to have people

---------12:22----------
like Chris working here and Camille they

---------12:24----------
figure this thing out that is awesome

---------12:27----------
they just took the time on their own to

---------12:29----------
figure this [ __ ] out they stayed late

---------12:31----------
did overtime just sat here searched I'm

---------12:36----------
a lucky guy I'll see you on the next

---------12:38----------
video thanks for watching and as always

---------12:39----------
I hope you learned something
