---------00:00----------
here we have a Macbook let's figure out

---------00:03----------
what's wrong with this math book it says

---------00:04----------
that it doesn't power on let's open up

---------00:06----------
this MacBook and see what's going on

---------00:07----------
with it show me where they touched you

---------00:11----------
MacBook who hurts you all right time to

---------00:14----------
figure it out

---------00:14----------
why it is that this will not turn off so

---------00:16----------
this is drawing a consistent 200

---------00:18----------
milliamps but it's not turning on 200

---------00:21----------
milliamps is much higher than what we

---------00:24----------
normally not over 150 milliamps and not

---------00:28----------
turning on is usually one of two things

---------00:29----------
behind door number one our issue is that

---------00:32----------
pp bus g3 hot is short circuited which

---------00:35----------
we're going to check for right now let's

---------00:37----------
just forget Paul Daniels is multimeter

---------00:38----------
software on the screen and it's not we

---------00:45----------
have eight point six volts

---------00:56----------
and the second likelihood is that we're

---------00:59----------
not making an Esso state so let's get

---------01:01----------
the board out of the case so the next

---------01:03----------
thing that we're gonna do is try and

---------01:04----------
figure out why it is we're getting 200

---------01:06----------
milliamps rather than what we're

---------01:07----------
supposed to be getting so let's take a

---------01:08----------
look at the board underneath our

---------01:09----------
microscope see if the microscope can

---------01:12----------
help me solve my problem a lot of the

---------01:16----------
times what you got to do is take a look

---------01:18----------
at the board they have a really

---------01:19----------
interesting pubes there and just knock

---------01:21----------
that off the board SMC area looks fine

---------01:34----------
hiya Sally Aria looks fine which we

---------01:36----------
expected since it does get 8.6 volts on

---------01:38----------
our pp bus all says power good area

---------01:41----------
looks fine that I was not expecting I

---------01:43----------
was expecting there to be some sort of

---------01:44----------
corrosion or something over here since

---------01:46----------
that is what key would keep us from

---------01:48----------
getting cpu vcore in an Esso state aha

---------01:51----------
look at that that's something I don't

---------01:54----------
think I would have spotted easily wonder

---------01:57----------
what that is

---------01:58----------
hmm what are you for this is the 1.05

---------02:03----------
volt PCH switch this is going to send

---------02:06----------
out key P 1 vo 5 s o SW PCH something

---------02:12----------
something which trap which this is going

---------02:15----------
to power the platform controller hub

---------02:17----------
section of my CPU which is similar to

---------02:19----------
like a north bridge in the South Bridge

---------02:21----------
which you're going to need in order for

---------02:22----------
this to power on and work so I'm not

---------02:24----------
just going to assume that that capacitor

---------02:26----------
has an issue with it I'm probably just

---------02:27----------
going to replace the switch as well

---------02:56----------
[Music]

---------03:09----------
we will soon Paul Daniels we will soon

---------03:45----------
never detect

---------03:50----------
never

---------04:17----------
it's gonna scrape away the junk you

---------04:19----------
don't want to solder on top of junk we

---------04:21----------
want to scrape away the junk and have

---------04:23----------
the junk flow onto this ball of my

---------04:26----------
solder that's on my iron and my iron

---------04:29----------
would be filled with junk but then

---------04:31----------
that's fine because we just put it in

---------04:32----------
the EKKO f99 B tip cleaning station

---------04:42----------
scrape scrape scrape scrape scrape

---------04:45----------
scrape scrape scrape scrape roflcopter

---------04:53----------
scrape scrape speak

---------04:56----------
scrape scrape scrape roflcopter

---------05:01----------
roflcopter

---------06:26----------
let's see if there's anything else

---------06:28----------
around this board

---------06:54----------
okay see if we get any change and how

---------06:56----------
this thing works

---------07:08----------
as you can see we now have a fan spin

---------07:11----------
and the reason we have a fan spin on

---------07:13----------
this board is because we fixed our issue

---------07:15----------
with the PCH not getting power

---------07:17----------
it was corrosion on this chip 1.05 volt

---------07:20----------
PCH kisi ou switch and since we didn't

---------07:25----------
have the hissy Oh switch the PCH threw a

---------07:28----------
hissy fit and didn't turn on and that is

---------07:31----------
why this MacBook didn't work but now

---------07:32----------
it's working because it's not able to

---------07:34----------
throw a hissy fit since we have the

---------07:35----------
hissy uh switch on and that's it for

---------07:37----------
today and this board and as always I

---------07:39----------
hope you learned something with that

---------07:40----------
you're gonna be moving on to the next

---------07:41----------
MacBook do you have a MacBook that needs

---------07:43----------

---------08:45----------
about their infinite number of

---------08:46----------
certifications while using photos from

---------08:48----------
stock photo comm where they hold a

---------08:50----------
soldering iron from the hot end we take

pride in the work that we do and we take

---------08:54----------
pride in doing it here not outsourcing

---------08:56----------
it thank you for your business thank you
