---------00:00----------
you mother hey everybody how's it going

---------00:02----------
today we're gonna be killing the corona

---------00:05----------
virus on this MacBook die cross die

---------00:13----------
yes die and then we're gonna fix it die

---------00:20----------
Corona die beer virus the goggles are it

---------00:39----------
filters have blue light I kind of like

---------00:42----------
it like that

---------00:52----------
how can I help you for those wondering

---------01:01----------
why do I wear a mask in my own office

---------01:03----------
it's because people who were my staff

---------01:05----------
will walk in every now and then and ask

---------01:07----------
questions in close proximity and having

---------01:09----------
to put the [ __ ] on and off and on and

---------01:11----------
off and on and off as a pain in the ass

---------01:12----------
if the day is over and I'm the only

---------01:14----------
person here and I'm working on my

---------01:16----------
bicycle no masks if I'm standing around

---------01:19----------
14 employees masks 14 Jesus Christ

---------01:23----------
everybody bloated company this has

---------01:25----------
become so many people do miss Paul

---------01:30----------
sitting right behind you sometimes yes

---------01:32----------
sometimes no what I really need to get

---------01:35----------
work done and be alone I like to have

---------01:37----------
the lack of distraction because I'm very

---------01:38----------
easily distracted yeah I'm a very easily

---------01:43----------
distracted person so it helps for me to

---------01:47----------
block so what I do to get around it is I

---------01:49----------
like to block out the distractions

---------01:50----------
entirely so I'll ignore everybody even

---------01:53----------
if they have a legit question I will

---------01:55----------
have my headphones on and I'll do what I

---------02:00----------
need to be doing so the first thing that

---------02:02----------
I do here as with every MacBook is I

---------02:08----------
unplug the battery because I want to see

---------02:10----------
how much power the board is taking not

---------02:12----------
with the battery stating yeah

---------02:22----------
I'm gonna plug in a USB C charger and

---------02:25----------
the USB C amp meter I actually like

---------02:31----------
these UV goggles what I like okay so one

---------02:35----------
port doesn't do anything and the other

---------02:39----------
port I miss throwing junk at the wall at

---------02:43----------
the old store you didn't work at the old

---------02:46----------
store yeah interesting one port boot

---------02:52----------
loops the other port just does nothing

---------02:58----------
and something tells me that we have a

---------03:01----------
wee bit of liquid damage that looks like

---------03:07----------
a droplet I hope hopefully it's not a

---------03:11----------
corona droplet please don't be a corona

---------03:14----------
droplet okay so we're going to take the

---------03:19----------
board out of the machine and kill all of

---------03:22----------
its corona droplets

---------03:25----------
I'll be glad when you can get your

---------03:27----------
original gloves if their beer virus is

---------03:29----------
over feel like I'm watching a very kinky

---------03:30----------
porn yeah beer virus I hope real does

---------03:33----------
ends at some point

---------03:58----------
so

---------04:00----------
the USBC port itself has seen better

---------04:04----------
days for certain this USBC port has seen

---------04:10----------
happier days

---------04:25----------
yeah this is a sad little USBC port

---------04:37----------
this is a CD 3215 chip over here this is

---------04:40----------
a USB C port controller

---------05:02----------
so the first thing that I would do is

---------05:04----------
reflow these two chips because I don't

---------05:06----------
see massive corrosion I don't see

---------05:09----------
anything indicative of this mass mass

---------05:12----------
damage and also let's just check out

---------05:16----------
what's going on with the probe points

---------05:18----------
over here now that red stuff you see is

---------05:20----------
the board bleeding the board appears to

---------05:22----------
be bleeding

---------05:55----------
those probe coins actually look really

---------05:57----------
bad that's just that's not just normal

---------05:59----------
corrosion that's stuck on there

---------06:00----------
I can't even scratch that out I mean

---------06:06----------
look at this hey what is this view the

---------06:19----------
board who hurt this board its owner

---------06:21----------
that's who hurt this board that was

---------06:24----------
seriously what is this stuff this is

---------06:31----------
there is disgusting [ __ ] all over there

---------06:34----------
and it won't come off it won't scrape

---------06:37----------
off okay it'll burn off so I can burn it

---------06:42----------
off I want to at least get an idea of

---------06:45----------
what probe points are missing and what

---------06:47----------
they're for

---------06:57----------
all right so what is this oh that's a

---------06:59----------
good question where you can open up a

---------07:01----------
schematic for this board and see what

---------07:05----------
that stuff is for so that goes to the CD

---------07:09----------
32 15 that's 20 volts but that's that's

---------07:14----------
not really this is not something that

---------07:16----------
matters so this is something that goes

---------07:18----------
from the CD 32 team it goes to this

---------07:21----------
diode but this doesn't actually have a

---------07:23----------
path anywhere else like it's going to

---------07:26----------
the component this is just for me to

---------07:28----------
measure so I don't need it we have this

---------07:30----------
the gate of a transistor now if there

---------07:33----------
was a blob of water over here it makes

---------07:34----------
sense that this is what's gonna get the

---------07:36----------
most hit because you have 20 volts right

---------07:40----------
here 20 volts is direct charger voltage

---------07:42----------
that's what's gonna crowed the fastest

---------07:44----------
but it doesn't look like any of the

---------07:46----------
damage over here is anything that

---------07:47----------
matters it looks like it's just cosmetic

---------07:51----------
this cap I'm gonna take a look and see

---------07:54----------
if this belongs in the board that's know

---------07:58----------
stuff okay so what I need to do here is

---------08:00----------
focus on the CD 32:15 and also on not

---------08:03----------
allowing the 20 volts from this point to

---------08:06----------
get to the actual data lines of the CD

---------08:08----------
32 teams most likely we're going to need

---------08:09----------
to replace the CD 32 15 I don't think

---------08:12----------
that a reflow is gonna be good enough

---------08:13----------
here I don't think that's gonna that's

---------08:15----------
gonna get us where we need to be

---------08:31----------
so I just put some flux there I forgot

---------08:34----------
to zoom out so you didn't see that my

---------08:35----------
bad we're gonna give them a little bit

---------08:38----------
of a reflow with our quick 861 DW I

---------08:43----------
still use the quick over here just

---------08:45----------
because I've been too lazy to take it

---------08:47----------
off my desk and get everything set up

---------08:49----------
with that Otten station

---------09:16----------
[Applause]

---------10:11----------
you can see a lot of red stuff coming

---------10:13----------
out from underneath the chip what that

---------10:16----------
tells me is that there was a lot of dirt

---------10:18----------
under here a lot of junk

---------10:25----------
so I wanna push down and just a little

---------10:28----------
bit not a lot cuz if I push down all the

---------10:30----------
way all the balls pop out

---------10:31----------
I just want to make sure those balls are

---------10:33----------
reconstituted as balls

---------10:59----------
[Music]

---------11:17----------
yeah that poor one over here looks

---------11:19----------
really screwed up

---------11:39----------
this may need an entire replacement port

---------11:41----------
however these ports are soldered onto

---------11:43----------
the board and they are not soldered on

---------11:45----------
in an easy manner this is not like just

---------11:46----------
replacing a DC jack on a PC at all so

---------11:52----------
first things first

---------11:56----------
let's see if I have the capability to

---------11:58----------
get 20 volts on the working port so 5

---------12:01----------
volts 900 ml amps that is not good that

---------12:04----------
is not good at all we are not supposed

---------12:07----------
to be taking 500 ml nine hundred

---------12:09----------
milliamps that's insane

---------12:16----------
and I kind of wonder if that's a result

---------12:18----------
of this actual port being shorted here

---------12:20----------
because the Pens are touching

---------12:25----------
there could be a part of what's going on

---------12:26----------
here

---------12:31----------
800 milliamps that's crazy all right so

---------12:35----------
let's see if we can measure where our

---------12:37----------
short-circuit actually lies here I'm

---------12:40----------
gonna turn on mr. Paul Daniels a

---------12:41----------
software which helps us to show you on

---------12:44----------
the screen what it is that I'm looking

---------12:46----------
at let's get that started so I'm gonna

---------12:55----------
take a wild guess that the short circuit

---------12:57----------
to ground has to do with the 20 volts

---------12:59----------
coming into the machine so 20 volts

---------13:05----------
comes into the Machine around this fuse

---------13:08----------
area

---------13:24----------
500 ohms that's not really too terrible

---------13:37----------
what about before that

---------13:44----------
let's measure over here where it's gonna

---------13:46----------
be pointing directly from the port all

---------13:48----------
right so the charging port itself is

---------13:50----------
actually short-circuited to ground the

---------13:54----------
charging port itself is short-circuit as

---------13:56----------
a ground that it's gonna be the port so

---------14:00----------
when you look on the schematic on the

---------14:02----------
board view what I'm looking at here is

---------14:05----------
right where that twenty volts comes into

---------14:06----------
the computer so I'm not looking over

---------14:08----------
there 20 volts is coming in here right

---------14:14----------
from the port itself and you saw what

---------14:17----------
the port looks like the port is corroded

---------14:22----------
and beaten down and nasty so there is a

---------14:26----------
chance here that we may be able to save

---------14:27----------
one of these ports right so the customer

---------14:30----------
wouldn't have to they'd only have one

---------14:34----------
let's see if we can dig a short out of

---------14:37----------
this because there are customers that

---------14:39----------
would be willing to pay for a partial

---------14:40----------
repair where instead of having two ports

---------14:43----------
they have one but they pay less money so

---------14:46----------
where I see the nastiest section what

---------14:49----------
I'm gonna try doing here is I'm just

---------14:50----------
gonna dig and I'm gonna dig all this

---------14:53----------
[ __ ] out of here and see what happens

---------14:57----------
because remember a place I can't really

---------14:59----------
give a discount on board a pair if I

---------15:01----------
have to replace this port because this

---------15:02----------
machine this this port is absolutely

---------15:05----------
effing miserable to replace it's a lot

---------15:08----------
of annoying work and the pins are really

---------15:11----------
really short they don't actually make

---------15:12----------
their way all the way through the hole

---------15:13----------
so soldering the replacement in is a

---------15:15----------
nightmare getting this out of there is a

---------15:17----------
nightmare so what I could potentially do

---------15:21----------
if the customers on a budget which a lot

---------15:23----------
of people during the Cove at 1900 are

---------15:25----------
they say listen I can get you a working

---------15:27----------
machine with one port you'd have to use

---------15:30----------
a dongle which let's face it it's a

---------15:31----------
[ __ ] neck hook you have to use the

---------15:32----------
dongle to get most of your [ __ ] done

---------15:34----------
with this thing anyway you'd have to use

---------15:37----------
a dongle you get one working port and I

---------15:40----------
can give you a discount on the repair

---------15:42----------
because it's not a full

---------15:44----------
okay let's see if that's the case here

---------15:47----------
so we are going to try this and we

---------15:54----------
actually went from four ohms to zero

---------15:56----------
ohms so No Mas that's not gonna do it

---------15:59----------
we're not making any progress on that

---------16:01----------
situation so next up what I'm going to

---------16:05----------
try and do is remove the port and see if

---------16:07----------
that removes the short

---------16:22----------
also it may make sense to do actually is

---------16:24----------
remove the nozzle to my iron

---------16:32----------
you're gonna get a worse view as a

---------16:33----------
result of this but I need to be able to

---------16:35----------
do this properly which means I need more

---------16:37----------
heat and I need to heat to be straight

---------16:39----------
on not at an angle so you're not gonna

---------16:41----------
be able to see this well and I do

---------16:42----------
apologize for that

---------16:52----------
you're not gonna get a good angle here

---------16:53----------
but you're just gonna have to accept it

---------16:55----------
because I need to be able to do this job

---------16:56----------
properly now what I'm gonna do here is

---------17:00----------
I'm lifting the board up like that

---------17:02----------
personally mnDOT's change the focus here

---------17:03----------
so that you can actually see so what I'm

---------17:07----------
doing here is I'm lifting the board up

---------17:09----------
by the port the reason I'm doing that is

---------17:10----------
because the moment I've used enough heat

---------17:12----------
to get this job done this second I have

---------17:15----------
used enough heat what I need I want that

---------17:17----------
port to go get the [ __ ] out of the board

---------17:19----------
I don't want to use any more heat than

---------17:22----------
what's absolutely necessary

---------17:45----------
and there we go

---------17:58----------
now here's the part about this

---------17:59----------
particular repair that sucks

---------18:05----------
so all of these holes need to be Oh all

---------18:10----------
of those holes are going to have to be

---------18:14----------
have all this I'll remove your take on

---------18:17----------
NYPD removing anti-crime unit I don't

---------18:20----------
know enough about it man I really don't

---------18:32----------
I think people are just so fed up on

---------18:34----------
every end of the spectrum right now that

---------18:36----------
decisions are going to be made without

---------18:37----------
thinking them all the way through

---------19:02----------
okay so we got the port and the shield

---------19:04----------
off but let me explain what the hard

---------19:07----------
part is here just pull off the BGA chip

---------19:09----------
section by the way

---------19:15----------
so see all of these holes over here not

---------19:18----------
a single one of those holes is ready for

---------19:20----------
a new port because they're all filled

---------19:22----------
with some and there are two Stephen if

---------19:24----------
you use one of those vacuum pump things

---------19:27----------
it's never going to get inside of all

---------19:29----------
those holes because of the size of them

---------19:30----------
I know my Chad is gonna fill up but to

---------19:33----------
use a hack Oh 808 or an equivalent type

---------19:36----------
tool or even worse use a solder sucker

---------19:39----------
from people who really never used it for

---------19:41----------
this type of work who are gonna claim

---------19:42----------
that it works you know those pieces of

---------19:44----------
[ __ ] where you hit the button and a

---------19:46----------
little piece of plastic jumps up and

---------19:47----------
somehow that's actually supposed to suck

---------19:49----------
up solder but watch we're gonna go

---------19:54----------
through this I'm just gonna add some

---------19:55----------
leaded solder because it's gonna be

---------19:56----------
easier to remove from the holes if at

---------19:59----------
all and then you go over it with wick

---------20:01----------
but the problem here is that it's not

---------20:02----------
gonna go inside the actual hole and

---------20:05----------
that's the part that sucks

---------20:10----------
I'll show you later on that I removed

---------20:12----------
the short circuit from the DCN board

---------20:17----------
so see when you suck up the Sutter it

---------20:20----------
removes all of it from some holes some

---------20:24----------
of it from all holes but not all solder

---------20:27----------
from all the holes and that's where this

---------20:31----------
becomes the type of nightmare that makes

---------20:32----------
you want to cry good luck getting all of

---------20:39----------
the sudden out of all the holes at the

---------20:41----------
same time that's not the way the world

---------20:45----------
works so I can show you a little hack

---------20:47----------
that helps that happen I can show you a

---------20:52----------
hack that I use for those worried about

---------20:57----------
ripping pads this is not an SS LJ 9000

---------21:00----------
console channel strip bus board do those

---------21:03----------
pads this board just absorbs heat and

---------21:05----------
absorbs heat and keeps on going over

---------21:07----------
this is an Apple product Apple products

---------21:10----------
cool themselves via the case absorbing

---------21:15----------
the heat because [ __ ] up the heat sink

---------21:17----------
fan that it comes with is actually gonna

---------21:19----------
do the job so this this board is pretty

---------21:22----------
much a giant thermal brick those pads

---------21:26----------
this is not an iPhone those pads are not

---------21:29----------
going anywhere

---------21:30----------
so I can be pretty mean to those pads I

---------21:32----------
want to worry about that also yes I know

---------21:36----------
I have to reflow some of those diodes

---------21:37----------
back in a place that moved around but

---------21:39----------
that's for later

---------21:48----------
now every one of these holes every last

---------21:51----------
one needs to be it close to empty

---------21:58----------
and that's where this becomes not fun so

---------22:01----------
amusing leg wick which you can get it

---------22:03----------
store that Rossman group calm don't

---------22:04----------
delay by today hi hi if you edit in this

---------22:06----------
video you better put a link to store

---------22:09----------
that Rossum the group.com product page

---------22:10----------
for good with their chill chill

---------22:24----------
indeed chill okay so we do this now in

---------22:30----------
some areas the solder comes out of the

---------22:32----------
hole very easily and others it will

---------22:34----------
protest and not want to come out so then

---------22:40----------
you go to the other side of the board

---------22:41----------
pitch and you do the same thing there

---------23:21----------
now what I do once I get to the point

---------23:23----------
that some of the holes don't want to be

---------23:26----------
unstuffed is I take my wire cutter

---------23:29----------
thingies no loose limbs not even close

---------23:34----------
hell no and then I cut the wick to make

---------23:37----------
it much thinner

---------23:38----------
I cut the wick and then I twist it like

---------23:44----------
this see it's twisted and then I'm going

---------23:48----------
to take my hot air station put a nozzle

---------23:52----------
on it

---------24:05----------
turn it on and I'm going to try to shove

---------24:08----------
the wick through the hole while heating

---------24:10----------
the hole

---------24:16----------
so you need flux for this I'm going to

---------24:20----------
grab the wick with the tweezer and then

---------24:27----------
I'm going to try to shove the wick

---------24:28----------
through the hole like so

---------24:58----------
at some point you're awake is going to

---------25:00----------
start not cooperating like mine is again

---------25:03----------
you're gonna have to take it

---------25:05----------
cut that used piece off do it again

---------25:08----------
rinse repeat over and over again I'm not

---------25:11----------
saying that this is a pleasant process

---------25:12----------
it is not a pleasant process I'd be

---------25:15----------
lying to you if I told you it was it

---------25:17----------
sucks this process sucks

---------25:21----------
really bad

---------25:26----------
like this is not a fun way to spend an

---------25:28----------
afternoon and at this point the job is

---------25:31----------
pretty brainless you're not actually

---------25:32----------
using your brain or thinking in any way

---------25:34----------
you're really just the gen of it

---------25:43----------
it's also I made the wick a little too

---------25:45----------
thick there so I'm gonna have to do

---------25:49----------
something about that or like grab it at

---------25:51----------
the end and kind of shove it in the hole

---------26:00----------
also you want to be careful of the chips

---------26:02----------
nearby that are under filled because you

---------26:05----------
don't want to heat that stuff very bad

---------26:11----------
again as much as this method can be

---------26:13----------
aggravating it's still much better than

---------26:15----------
using a piece of [ __ ] solder sucker that

---------26:16----------
doesn't actually work

---------26:26----------
hamster work high-five indeed

---------26:57----------
at some point you're gonna totally run

---------27:00----------
out of patience like I did because the

---------27:01----------
wicks not going to want to go through

---------27:02----------
the hole anymore

---------27:08----------
which is pretty close to where I am but

---------27:10----------
luckily once you're at that point you

---------27:13----------
hopefully somewhere around that time you

---------27:17----------
will be close to done which is where I

---------27:18----------
am right now so I have a few more that I

---------27:21----------
need to stick my wick through a few more

---------27:27----------
and then after that I really do hope

---------27:30----------
that I'm done yes it is a couple here

---------27:35----------
that haven't been cooperative they're

---------27:39----------
gonna grab the wick with the tweezer

---------28:03----------
also I got to cut the end of this

---------28:05----------
because it's not threading in nicely

---------28:10----------
the whip is not reading nicely

---------28:14----------
now what your thread nicely

---------29:07----------
at some point it's gonna get more and

---------29:09----------
more difficult to tell if there's still

---------29:10----------
solder left in the hole because you

---------29:12----------
can't see all the way through the hole

---------29:14----------
because every one of those holes you may

---------29:16----------
think is clear supposed to be clear but

---------29:20----------
it's actually a black hole to hell

---------29:22----------
because it's an Apple product so you're

---------29:25----------
not gonna be able to see all the way

---------29:26----------
through a lot of them they may still

---------29:31----------
have flux in

---------29:56----------
you got some that are still going to be

---------29:58----------
really picky

---------30:02----------
coming to see if I can get my what

---------30:06----------
happens if I can get my trees it through

---------30:07----------
each one of these holes so the tweezer

---------30:12----------
itself is too thick to go through the

---------30:13----------
holes let those small these holes up

---------30:17----------
can't get the tweezer to go through on

---------30:19----------
the other side because absolutely crazy

---------30:25----------
[Music]

---------31:10----------
[Music]

---------31:26----------
it's hard to tell if what you have

---------31:27----------
inside of some of those holes is dirty

---------31:29----------
flux or actual solder

---------31:36----------
and again you're gonna reach the point

---------31:38----------
like me where you don't want to use the

---------31:39----------
wick anymore because you only get one or

---------31:41----------
two uses out of it after it before I

---------31:42----------
doesn't want to go through the hole

---------31:43----------
anymore and then you have to cut it up

---------31:45----------
again

---------31:51----------
and that is going to require a certain

---------31:53----------
level of patience

---------32:22----------
see after a few goes into the after it

---------32:26----------
touches it a few times it loses its

---------32:27----------
pointyness and then I can't get the damn

---------32:30----------
wick through the hole again so this is

---------32:33----------
really something where you will you you

---------32:34----------
will find yourself losing your patience

---------32:54----------
see like after two holes I can't use

---------32:56----------
this piece of wick anymore and there's a

---------32:58----------
lot of holes there and I don't have the

---------32:59----------
patience to cut off 60 different pieces

---------33:01----------
of weight that's just that's not

---------33:03----------
happening

---------33:11----------
but when you poke the wick through the

---------33:13----------
hole it is gonna suck up the flux that's

---------33:15----------
in the hole which then answer the

---------33:17----------
question is that hole filled with flux

---------33:20----------
or solder

---------33:48----------
so at this point we're gonna get another

---------33:50----------
charge for it we're gonna smash it right

---------33:52----------
through there it's time for another

---------33:54----------
charge port my wick is absolutely fine

---------33:58----------
but you this is it did we wake of sloppy

---------34:01----------
because it's that's like saying them

---------34:03----------
it's like saying that a paper towel is

---------34:05----------
sloppy while you're in the middle of

---------34:06----------
cleaning a mess but it's literally the

---------34:08----------
piece that absorbs the mess

---------34:10----------
so naturally the wick is going to be

---------34:11----------
fluffy if it wasn't you would literally

---------34:14----------
not be doing a job is there something

---------34:16----------
wrong with your microphone no this

---------34:17----------
microphone seems to be fine I haven't

---------34:20----------
noticed anything wrong with this

---------34:21----------
microphone whatsoever actually the

---------34:24----------
microphone appears to be just fine get a

---------34:28----------
desoldering pump if you soldering pump

---------34:30----------
is a awful way to do this trip a

---------34:33----------
toothpick wouldn't work you would need a

---------34:35----------
needle a needle would work not a

---------34:37----------
toothpick you would need a sewing needle

---------34:38----------
but I don't have a sewing needle because

---------34:39----------
I'm a Macbook repair person if I did

---------34:43----------
through-hole soldering on a regular

---------34:44----------
basis I would definitely have myself a

---------34:46----------
set of sewing needles because a sewing

---------34:48----------
needle is actually perfect in this

---------34:50----------
instance because the sewing needle will

---------34:51----------
also absorb the solder because it's all

---------34:53----------
metal but I don't have a sewing needle

---------34:55----------
because I'm I fix MacBooks and I very

---------34:57----------
rarely if ever do through-hole repairs

---------34:59----------
let me get myself important I'll be

---------35:00----------
right back all right so we got a port so

---------35:05----------
now I believe that it was soldered in

---------35:08----------
this way yeah this went on the board

---------35:12----------
like so

---------35:15----------
so I'm gonna turn that fume extractor

---------35:17----------
off because the things making me deaf

---------35:21----------
turn this halogen light down cuz I'm

---------35:24----------
gonna kill it that's my old port

---------35:39----------
you can't even see if the leads go

---------35:41----------
through that's the sad part because this

---------35:43----------
here's the other thing that sucks about

---------35:45----------
this so this is through-hole soldering

---------35:47----------
right

---------35:48----------
this is through-hole soldering but where

---------35:52----------
are the holes oh here the pins look the

---------35:54----------
pin only goes halfway through the hole

---------35:55----------
so soldering this in there take this

---------35:58----------
ain't easy this is not your this is not

---------36:00----------
your Grandpa's through-hole soldering

---------36:02----------
where once you were done getting this

---------36:04----------
stuff through the holes you took you

---------36:07----------
know you took your fine tipped flush

---------36:09----------
cutters and went cut cut cut cut cut now

---------36:14----------
I understand the reason for this you

---------36:15----------
know this is a very high bandwidth line

---------36:18----------
I mean this is a line with this is a

---------36:21----------
line with Thunderbolt 3 you know you're

---------36:24----------
transmitting gigabits per second over

---------36:26----------
this line you don't want the leads to be

---------36:28----------
acting as an antenna I don't blame the

---------36:30----------
fact that it is designed this way it

---------36:32----------
just doesn't mean may take away from the

---------36:34----------
fact that I want to curse throughout the

---------36:36----------
entire process while soldering it so the

---------36:39----------
first thing that I do before I solder a

---------36:40----------
new port make sure you got rid of your

---------36:41----------
freaking short so the short is gone as

---------36:43----------
you can see we had 4 ohms I tried to dig

---------36:45----------
it out and I got to 0 ohms now we have

---------36:48----------
862 ohms they are point eight six 2k is

---------36:51----------
you know point eight six two thousand is

---------36:54----------
the same as 862 so we push it in there

---------36:56----------
the port is going to be pushed in and

---------36:59----------
now what we need to do is solder it to

---------37:03----------
the board or solder if you're in Europe

---------37:06----------
or Australia now you want to make sure

---------37:10----------
that it's pushed in there nicely which

---------37:12----------
it is here I got that thing pushed in

---------37:14----------
there nicely and iMac and

---------37:32----------
I also believe that on this idea the

---------37:34----------
perimeter is gonna wind up being no

---------37:38----------
actually I'm right there

---------37:47----------
I think this actually gets hot aired on

---------37:49----------
because here's what I think is gonna

---------37:50----------
happen I think that what goes on here is

---------37:54----------
that this perimeter actually solder is

---------37:57----------
to the metal around the port your

---------38:04----------
hamster body switch you can switch that

---------38:06----------
makes no sense

---------38:07----------
you could have to read through Eugene

---------38:09----------
solder joints no Eugene

---------38:14----------
no Eugenia

---------38:19----------
so I think this is actually going to be

---------38:21----------
held in by more than just those little

---------38:23----------
individual pins so the first thing I got

---------38:24----------
to do

---------38:33----------
my micro pencil seems like it just died

---------38:43----------
okay micro pencil is dead lame

---------38:52----------
so I think I may actually be hot airing

---------38:54----------
this in from the top at first

---------39:06----------
and then I'll solder the individual pins

---------39:31----------
solder paste is not a good thing to use

---------39:37----------
you wind up with solder everywhere

---------39:41----------
we're in smaller hands oh yeah but I'd

---------39:45----------
also be as dumb as a hamster

---------40:21----------
all right so first thing gonna do heat

---------40:24----------
this from the top and push it down

---------40:31----------
I'm gonna use less heat because I don't

---------40:32----------
want to risk melting any sort of plastic

---------40:35----------
inside of it

---------40:47----------
[Laughter]

---------41:37----------
all right I'm pushing down because I

---------41:40----------
want those pins to go deep into those

---------41:42----------
holes to encase the likelihood that they

---------41:46----------
will when I solder them to each

---------41:48----------
individual pad it'll make it there it's

---------41:53----------
also gonna take a while to drive because

---------41:55----------
I mean since it's gonna take a while to

---------41:59----------
cool off and dry and become solid

---------42:01----------
because I have heated the entire board

---------42:04----------
not just a single area of it so the

---------42:07----------
reason that it usually dries quickly is

---------42:09----------
because the rest of the board is cool

---------42:11----------
and the board has a lot of thermal mass

---------42:13----------
so will absorb the heat so now I've got

---------42:21----------
all my pins there let me see if I can

---------42:31----------
fix my micro pencil by unplugging it and

---------42:33----------
plugging it back in turning it off and

---------42:36----------
on again holy [ __ ] that actually worked

---------42:39----------
all right looks like I have a micro

---------42:41----------
pencil back which is going to be much

---------42:43----------
easier to use and getting this job done

---------42:51----------
so what I want to do is I want to keep

---------42:54----------
in mind that that little that little pin

---------43:00----------
is not coming through the hole at all so

---------43:03----------
it's not like I'm gonna be able to have

---------43:06----------
the pin touching the pad

---------43:08----------
I need the solder to actually make its

---------43:10----------
way all the way through that hole and

---------43:12----------
not have a cold joint so I need to shove

---------43:17----------
as much solder in there as I can and

---------43:18----------
hope that it just marinates in there and

---------43:21----------
eventually heats the pin because I can't

---------43:23----------
touch the pin the pin is untouchable

---------43:48----------
no of course not David I just made that

---------43:50----------
clear hey pins will not come out all the

---------43:52----------
way they are not long enough

---------44:07----------
it's my hope that if I use the micro

---------44:09----------
pencil and I shove it in there that I'm

---------44:11----------
able to heat both the pen and the pen

---------44:14----------
but this is a hope in a prayer is it

---------44:23----------
worth it to buy a cheap hot air station

---------44:25----------
to work with first it really depends I

---------44:29----------
mean like with if that at 862 again if

---------44:32----------
I'm able to consistently get it and it

---------44:33----------
costs in the low to hundreds I really

---------44:35----------
think that it's cheap enough that is

---------44:36----------
just not worth it trying to go for super

---------44:38----------
cheaper I get it when the really good

---------44:40----------
hot air stations were a thousand dollars

---------44:42----------
or 600 but they've come down in price

---------44:45----------
enough that I don't see the point

---------44:55----------
I think honestly rather rebo and SMC

---------44:57----------
than do this

---------45:03----------
I'll fix all the bridges and the joins

---------45:05----------
afterwards the first thing I want to do

---------45:06----------
is just make sure that I heat the pin

---------45:08----------
and the pad

---------45:18----------
you may be asking why do I even bother

---------45:20----------
clearing the holes if I'm soldering it

---------45:23----------
from the other side using hot air to get

---------45:27----------
it in there to begin with well that's

---------45:30----------
that is because I'm an idiot

---------45:37----------
I don't think anybody would argue with

---------45:39----------
that

---------46:04----------
I need to use the large and large iron

---------46:07----------
to get rid of the bridging anyway so I

---------46:09----------
figured I might as well

---------46:15----------
what I'm hoping to do is heat the pin in

---------46:17----------
the pad and just have this giant thing

---------46:19----------
of molten solder over it that kind of

---------46:21----------
fall with fresh flux that falls right in

---------47:10----------
[Applause]

---------47:16----------
all right now what I want to do here

---------47:24----------
[Music]

---------47:27----------
is push the charge poured into the board

---------47:31----------
again

---------47:38----------
I'm gonna do another just to make sure

---------47:41----------
it that it's every single one of those

---------47:43----------
pins gets hot and gets to touch the

---------47:48----------
solder and this is his new flux there

---------47:50----------
that I'm not making the joints cold by

---------47:54----------
doing this

---------48:24----------
I'm letting the air out of the bottom of

---------48:26----------
my mat

---------48:30----------
and I'm pushing down on the port going

---------48:33----------
in really close with the hot air now

---------48:48----------
letting it dry

---------48:52----------
we let rapid cool technology do its

---------48:54----------
thing

---------48:58----------
rapid coal technology rapid coal

---------49:01----------
technology coming to a store near you

---------49:06----------
now while I'm in the process of waiting

---------49:08----------
for this to cool off utilizing rapid

---------49:11----------
coal technology I might as well do two

---------49:13----------
things at once I thank you very much

---------49:15----------
there VAR I'm gonna use this as an

---------49:18----------
opportunity to clean my desk make it

---------49:20----------
look a little nicer get ready for the

---------49:22----------
next repair if this one is done can't

---------49:26----------
hurt to be clean right the rapid cooling

---------49:32----------
process has completed so now I'm gonna

---------49:35----------
plug the charging yeah and honestly if I

---------49:37----------
just don't have a short to ground on

---------49:39----------
output that'll mean I made some progress

---------49:41----------
and I can be happy with something let's

---------49:43----------
see what happens here let's see if I

---------49:47----------
made any progress worth being happy

---------49:48----------
about dcn

---------49:58----------
uh-huh oh is it this one or this one

---------50:02----------
well that that's not a short that's not

---------50:05----------
a shirt okay what happens if I plug this

---------50:08----------
in

---------50:10----------
now this port says five volts 37 mil

---------50:13----------
amps it does not appear to go 220 volts

---------50:20----------
however it also does not take 800 to 900

---------50:22----------
milliamp sandai which is a good thing

---------50:26----------
let's see what the other port does

---------50:39----------
so that one's boot looping

---------50:49----------
also I'm curious with voltage again on

---------50:51----------
pp 3 B 3

---------51:05----------
all right so most likely our CD 30 32 32

---------51:09----------
15 s could use some replacing which is

---------51:11----------
not surprising given that the board

---------51:13----------
looks like total [ __ ] it's not

---------51:20----------
surprising in this instance that the CD

---------51:22----------
32 15 s would be damaged and need

---------51:24----------
replacing so it's no big deal we're just

---------51:25----------
gonna take them up replacing I don't

---------51:29----------
have a nozzle on my iron so I'm actually

---------51:31----------
just gonna be lazy and remove them

---------51:32----------
without the nozzle on my iron

---------51:34----------
I need a nozzle for this

---------52:34----------
well you could see that there was a good

---------52:36----------
chance of those balls we're touching

---------52:37----------
underneath there

---------53:28----------
[Music]

---------54:30----------
one of the resistors slid over a little

---------54:32----------
but that's no big deal I can always

---------54:33----------
slide that right back into place so it

---------54:36----------
needs to be done now there's two cd32

---------54:39----------
15s need to be placed so I'm just gonna

---------54:48----------
go get some okay so we have ourselves

---------54:52----------
some replacements cd32 15 chips

---------55:03----------
now I'm gonna have a little bit of the

---------55:04----------
flux go on that resistor because

---------55:06----------
remember I want to flow that resistor

---------55:07----------
back into place also you could see when

---------55:09----------
I used wick over here that on the left

---------55:11----------
side there is a resistor that had it saw

---------55:14----------
to remove from it

---------56:19----------
I should put my nozzle back in place

---------56:22----------
here

---------58:05----------
[Music]

---------58:26----------
yeah

---------58:39----------
I moved it a little bit when I was

---------58:41----------
drying which was stupid

---------58:45----------
I don't want to call it joined as a

---------58:47----------
result of that all right so now we let

---------58:49----------
the rapid pull technology

---------58:53----------
wrap it for okay rapid cooling

---------59:01----------
now we have two new cd32 the teams and a

---------59:03----------
new charge for it all the corrosion has

---------59:05----------
been removed at this point I would

---------59:08----------
expect to see alternate results

---------59:34----------
nothing

---------59:40----------
nothing

---------59:42----------
so we went from five volts bootloop

---------59:45----------
being 24 milliamp to the charge port is

---------59:48----------
not even connected to the freakin board

---------59:52----------
you're trolling

---------60:04----------
[Applause]

---------60:08----------
you're trolling me

---------60:19----------
[Applause]

---------60:30----------
okay

---------60:36----------
now that could be either the cd32 15

---------60:39----------
issue or it could be that my charge port

---------60:42----------
moved a little I honestly don't know

---------60:45----------
which one it is

---------60:53----------
and I don't have a particular way to

---------60:55----------
tell

---------61:29----------
some of those joints looked a little

---------61:31----------
cold only after putting all the heat on

---------61:33----------
for the cd32 the team reflows and

---------61:36----------
replacements so we're gonna try doing

---------61:39----------
gut I'm gonna add yet another line of

---------61:42----------
flux down there

---------61:43----------
end up there and I'm gonna push down as

---------61:46----------
I push the connector onto the board

---------61:49----------
again

---------62:01----------
[Music]

---------62:04----------
I really don't believe that the chances

---------62:06----------
are that I soldered both cd32 15 so

---------62:09----------
improperly that it refuses to make any

---------62:12----------
that both ports are giving me nothing

---------62:14----------
that's really difficult to believe an

---------62:15----------
easier sell for me easier sell for me

---------62:23----------
would be that something moved here when

---------62:28----------
I reflow those chips in my charge voice

---------62:30----------
so

---------62:47----------
20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6

---------62:57----------
5 4 3 2 1 alright now we go in close and

---------63:02----------
we're gonna push

---------63:54----------
[Applause]

---------64:01----------
at this point I'm being controlled this

---------64:05----------
is an absolute effing troll

---------64:10----------
either that or I got fake cd32 15 wonder

---------64:16----------
what the possibility is at that

---------64:20----------
that is kind of ridiculous does it

---------64:24----------
actually even recognize it anymore

---------64:40----------
[Applause]

---------64:51----------
hmm did my charger take a [ __ ]

---------65:12----------
no charger does its job

---------65:27----------
if I push

---------65:35----------
[Music]

---------65:37----------
do put a bunch of fake cd32 15s and kind

---------65:40----------
of wondering if that's what I have over

---------65:41----------
here that would certainly be some

---------65:45----------
[ __ ] but I think that may be the

---------65:48----------
case

---------66:06----------
[Music]

---------66:10----------
this resistant looks out of place

---------66:14----------
that was nothing for

---------66:20----------
[Music]

---------66:39----------
wait you are out of place

---------66:44----------
what the hell is this [ __ ]

---------66:49----------
ah son of a [ __ ]

---------66:56----------
get the [ __ ] back down there

---------67:10----------
you [ __ ] troll

---------67:16----------
they still don't think that would cause

---------67:17----------
both ports to read nothing

---------67:59----------
five old 38 million bootloop

---------68:04----------
five or 38 MLM Hooten other port

---------68:10----------
nothing at all okay so the bottom port

---------68:18----------
is probably gonna go to the city 30 to

---------68:21----------
15 that is to the left

---------68:23----------
that's a resistor it's a critical

---------68:29----------
resistor that looks like [ __ ]

---------69:45----------
hmm

---------70:09----------
I'm sad missing cap on the right CD

---------70:11----------
32:15

---------70:16----------
that's a resistor and I think it's know

---------70:17----------
stuff

---------70:24----------
fairly certain that though there's no

---------70:26----------
stuff no double check and make sure

---------70:36----------
yeah there is a missing resistor there

---------70:38----------
not a cap

---------70:42----------
the board looks like [ __ ] oh it sure

---------70:44----------
does

---------71:41----------
[Music]

---------72:01----------
so we were put back to stuff that was

---------72:03----------
missing but we still have no difference

---------72:05----------
there the bottom port but Luke's after a

---------72:08----------
few seconds and the top port or a top

---------72:13----------
board actually does have some action now

---------72:16----------
but the top port also boot loops this is

---------72:20----------
with two new CD 3215 so both of the CD

---------72:22----------
32 who teams are boot looping so let's

---------72:26----------
see if I missed anything else here

---------72:36----------
I'm gonna compare it with the donor

---------72:41----------
so that resistor that's missing there is

---------72:43----------
actually supposed to be missing

---------74:26----------
here is this

---------75:44----------
here's a diet I knocked off down there

---------75:50----------
with CC 1 in CC - connection

---------75:57----------
that's they believe data

---------78:52----------
I'm gonna give this a quick ultrasonic

---------78:53----------
cleaning start off with something a

---------78:59----------
little cleaner although I'm fairly

---------79:01----------
certain that I'm gonna call this an

---------79:03----------
evening and say [ __ ] this board

---------79:16----------
dieeee troll boy die die troll board die

---------79:19----------
this board belongs on Paul's desk and

---------79:22----------
Paul's queue where I can torture Paul

---------79:25----------
the Paul desk the Paul queue the

---------79:29----------
superior queue the superior desk I knew

---------79:34----------
this was not gonna be a fun one I knew

---------79:35----------
it was gonna be miserable from the

---------79:37----------
moment that I started and for some

---------79:39----------
reason I persisted because I'm too

---------79:41----------
stubborn like that that's the sound of

---------79:46----------
my ultrasonic cleaning machine going

---------79:48----------
from the ultrasonic goes from the

---------79:53----------
ultrasonic goes I gotta wait for the

---------80:05----------
board to dry a lot of people asking me

---------80:06----------
why don't you show us the ultrasonic

---------80:08----------
with the board the click before and

---------80:09----------
after because waiting 30 minutes for a

---------80:11----------
board to dry is actually a really boring

---------80:13----------
stream content is you're about to find

---------80:16----------
out

---------80:16----------
yep literally sitting there watching an

---------80:19----------
empty camera as a board dries is some

---------80:21----------
low quality content very low quality

---------80:24----------
content

---------80:24----------
actually I'm submerging it in some 99%

---------80:27----------
alcohol tossing it around using this

---------80:31----------
squirt bottle to get underneath chips

---------80:34----------
forcefully now the board can go into the

---------80:38----------
oven

---------80:41----------
and in the oven it's gonna dry it all

---------80:43----------
off alright so we're back from the

---------80:46----------
ultrasonic cleaner if you were just

---------80:48----------
watching the stream you probably listen

---------80:50----------
to me rant and go on for about half an

---------80:52----------
hour over [ __ ]

---------80:53----------
anyway now that we have gone over the

---------80:55----------
fix do now that now that we've

---------80:57----------
ultrasonically cleaned it you can see

---------80:59----------
that over here this is the section where

---------81:02----------
there was the twenty volts where I was

---------81:04----------
trying to remove all the corrosion the

---------81:05----------
ultrasonic she did a really good job

---------81:06----------
cleaning it up now we had some nasty

---------81:08----------
stuff over here by the back light

---------81:10----------
circuit which the ultrasonic has cleaned

---------81:12----------
up that's not really what matters what

---------81:13----------
matters over here as you can see this

---------81:14----------
chip is actually moved a little bit most

---------81:16----------
likely when I was using a lot of heat to

---------81:19----------
remove that and the charge port and also

---------81:21----------
saw to that charge port back on and if

---------81:22----------
you take a look at the schematic in the

---------81:25----------
board view as to what it is that chip is

---------81:27----------
that is actually the Thunderbolt ROM and

---------81:29----------
you have to keep in mind that the issue

---------81:31----------
here is that my my USB sea charger which

---------81:34----------
is technically you know Thunderbolt is

---------81:36----------
not working so if we take a look in the

---------81:39----------
schematic let's look for you 2890 yeah

---------81:47----------
that that is the Thunderbolt ROM that is

---------81:48----------
going to be communicating with the

---------81:50----------
Thunderbolt chip that's gonna be

---------81:53----------
communicating over here that

---------81:54----------
communicates the Thunderbolt chip and

---------81:55----------
one thing to understand is that this

---------81:57----------
over here is actually going to be

---------81:58----------
communicating with you 2800 so u 2800 is

---------82:02----------
the main Thunderbolt controller take a

---------82:05----------
look at this this is the brains of

---------82:07----------
Thunderbolt

---------82:23----------
there's one page where it shows all the

---------82:25----------
things that speak to one another I guess

---------82:28----------
not

---------82:29----------
mm-hmm let's see you 3,100

---------82:39----------
I just speaks to the system management

---------82:40----------
controller well either way we're gonna

---------82:45----------
flow that little thing in a place over

---------82:46----------
there and once it's flown into place

---------82:48----------
you'll see that the board just turns on

---------82:50----------
and works the way it's supposed to I

---------82:51----------
will get to go home with a happy little

---------82:53----------
victory and this is where the ultrasonic

---------82:59----------
cleaner can help me out a little ways to

---------83:02----------
help me correct my idiotic mistake over

---------83:04----------
here I imagine once the SPI ROM is

---------83:07----------
actually put on the board properly that

---------83:09----------
we're gonna see 20 volts if we do I'll

---------83:11----------
be really happy and if we don't I will

---------83:13----------
then probably take this board and throw

---------83:15----------
it in the river and be honest with you

---------83:19----------
that's the essential way to go about

---------83:22----------
this

---------83:33----------
soon this is the second cap on top of

---------83:35----------
the chip doesn't look good but I

---------83:36----------
actually think it looks fine this whole

---------83:37----------
act section really I don't have any

---------83:39----------
complaints there

---------83:47----------
so we're going to pick this you're going

---------83:50----------
to plug it in plug it in tuck it in

---------83:56----------
yep as you can see we're getting 20

---------84:00----------
volts now edge twenty volts 17-mile amps

---------84:09----------
so we have solved our CD 3215 problem

---------84:12----------
that is solved

---------84:16----------
now we have to get to our next question

---------84:18----------
which is why doesn't the machine turn on

---------84:20----------
20 milliamps is not enough to actually

---------84:23----------
turn this thing on we could take a look

---------84:27----------
at things like PP but G pretty hot maybe

---------84:32----------
we take a look at that TP bus G free hot

---------84:33----------
see where that is

---------84:37----------
let's see PCBUs g3 hot is down here it's

---------84:42----------
12 point 9 13 volts so that is what I

---------84:45----------
would expect it to be however we don't

---------84:48----------
get any turning on from this computer

---------84:51----------
and that is one of the things with these

---------84:55----------
machines where but it really is gonna

---------84:58----------
keep drawing me and drawing me in

---------85:00----------
because I just made a little bit of

---------85:01----------
progress in that little bit of progress

---------85:03----------
that I made makes me want to get real

---------85:06----------
back in to figure out what the actual

---------85:08----------
problem at the board is and that's gonna

---------85:13----------
wind up keeping me here until 1:00 in

---------85:15----------
the morning

---------85:20----------
that's the way this always works

---------85:30----------
now if we take a look at the power rails

---------85:32----------
over here let's see

---------85:42----------
let's see so what power roles are we

---------85:44----------
supposed to have over there we're

---------85:45----------
supposed to have PP 5vs5

---------85:55----------
which we don't have let's plug this back

---------86:01----------
in and see for sure

---------86:33----------
by volts

---------86:36----------
five volts

---------86:39----------
- votes by volts

---------86:42----------
- votes now normally the TPS five one

---------86:45----------
nine eight zero flips out

---------87:06----------
so yeah 55 es5 going up and down and up

---------87:08----------
and down and usually that happens when

---------87:11----------
one of the power rails that's created by

---------87:14----------
you 7650 which is the TPS 509 8 0 is

---------87:19----------
short it's a ground let's just check

---------87:21----------
what we have here so pin 2 of the chip

---------87:24----------
is supposed to be VP 5 BS 4 one of the

---------87:27----------
rails that's created and I'm just gonna

---------87:29----------
see if we have that so it's so we have

---------87:37----------
hmm so that's not short it's a ground

---------87:40----------
now we could check rails like PP 3 B 3 s

---------87:44----------
5 and see if that's shorted

---------87:51----------
that's not shorted either

---------88:01----------
so into the rails that are actually

---------88:02----------
created by that ship have any sort of

---------88:04----------
short on them but that doesn't mean that

---------88:07----------
the UPS kit of the rails that are

---------88:08----------
upstream of it are not shorted so

---------88:10----------
perhaps it's only shorter when it's on

---------88:11----------
which means it's an s3 or an Esso rail

---------88:13----------
it's this bad

---------88:14----------
let's check TP 3 B 3 s o and P p5 ESO

---------88:18----------
and see what's going on there

---------88:19----------
so I'm going to search for PP 5 es o PP

---------88:25----------
5 V s o and let's see if that is

---------88:29----------
shortened so PP 5 ESO and we found

---------88:32----------
[Music]

---------88:37----------
right by the back light shed and see

---------88:39----------
what we got there

---------88:46----------
24:00 kilohms to ground that's not our

---------88:49----------
problem

---------88:52----------
and TP 3 v 3s Oh

---------89:02----------
it's gonna be on this little cap over

---------89:03----------
here

---------89:08----------
non-existent app over here

---------89:12----------
three kilohms that's strange okay so now

---------89:16----------
we have to figure out why that TPS 509

---------89:18----------
a0 is turning on and off and on and off

---------89:21----------
and on and off and on and on there's

---------89:23----------
none of the rails that are even upstream

---------89:25----------
from that here to have any problems

---------89:36----------
now our enable is gonna be on pin 12 or

---------89:39----------
PP 5 see if that is jumping

---------89:53----------
duh dish

---------90:09----------
the enable is turning on and off

---------90:16----------
and the enable is going to come from

---------90:19----------
[Music]

---------90:25----------
this which comes from the PM I see

---------90:34----------
which I'll give a quick reflow to before

---------90:36----------
we get this over to fall calls gonna

---------90:40----------
have a lot of fun with this one

---------91:23----------
there's probably a stupid thing to do

---------91:24----------
because the reason that's jumping up and

---------91:26----------
down is because there's some sort of

---------91:27----------
short-circuits somewhere not because the

---------91:30----------
chickens thought this chip itself it's

---------91:32----------
making the enable is that the problem is

---------91:34----------
I have no idea what could possibly be

---------91:35----------
short-circuited because I've measured

---------91:38----------
all these different rails and there's

---------91:40----------
nothing shorted on them I think I didn't

---------91:42----------
track 53v 3s forum 2 B 3 B 3 s 3 D 3 B 3

---------91:46----------
S 4 I guess I could check that

---------91:47----------
[Music]

---------92:10----------
there we go there we go there's the

---------92:13----------
shore so P P 3 B 3 s 5 is created by the

---------92:16----------
TPS 5 1 9 8 0 chip which you see over

---------92:18----------
here now pp 3 B 3 S 4 is also going to

---------92:23----------
be created from PP 3 2 is 5 so what's

---------92:26----------
powered by PP 3 B 3 S 4 that's a great

---------92:28----------
question

---------92:28----------
so something powered by PP 3 B 3 S 4 is

---------92:30----------
shorted to ground and [ __ ] up my

---------92:32----------
entire system now we need to figure out

---------92:34----------
what it is on this line that it could be

---------92:37----------
so I'd like to try and see if I can

---------92:39----------
figure it out the quick way without

---------92:40----------
injecting voltage by this looking

---------92:41----------
through stuff and seeing what looks

---------92:43----------
really nasty so what do we have up here

---------92:46----------
got water damaged in this area

---------92:55----------
however this stuff that's no stuff it's

---------92:57----------
not even on the board

---------92:58----------
those are resistors does that doesn't

---------93:01----------
even have a path to ground those don't

---------93:03----------
have a path to ground

---------93:04----------
that cap has a path to ground is that

---------93:06----------
could that be it maybe or there's this a

---------93:10----------
little friend up here this cap was one

---------93:13----------
of the ones that I actually thought was

---------93:14----------
bad did that that up there that's the

---------93:17----------
cap that I actually put back on the

---------93:19----------
board

---------93:19----------
you mother so we're going to take that

---------93:21----------
little bastard cap off of the board

---------93:32----------
and see if that changes our

---------93:33----------
short-circuit condition

---------93:39----------
I trusted you I almost knocked you off

---------93:42----------
and I put you back man wow what an

---------93:50----------
absolute thriller of a border pair 2019

---------93:53----------
kilohms two grounds at this point I

---------93:55----------
should be taking five to six-hundred am

---------93:58----------
500 to 600 ml amps and you should be

---------94:01----------
working

---------94:01----------
there's no need there's no reason for

---------94:03----------
you to not turn on I see 100 ml amps I

---------94:05----------
want to see 4 to 600 you better give me

---------94:08----------
4 to 600 you little bastard yes

---------94:10----------
[ __ ] you Apple all right now let's see

---------94:15----------
if I get a logo on the screen

---------94:21----------
seven hundred milliamps eight hundred

---------94:23----------
milliamps nine hundred milliamps

---------94:48----------
give me a question mark you [ __ ]

---------94:59----------
forty three point two volts on backlight

---------95:08----------
hmm we have 43 volts on backlight I

---------95:12----------
should be getting a picture here let's

---------95:18----------
see what happens if I have an SSD

---------95:19----------
attached

---------95:20----------
I should be getting at least a question

---------95:25----------
mark folder I know it's gonna boot slow

---------95:34----------
because I don't have the trackpad or any

---------95:35----------
other sensors plugged in it's weird

---------95:39----------
because if I had if it wasn't detecting

---------95:40----------
the screen and giving me no picture I

---------95:42----------
would not expect to have any sort of

---------95:45----------
backlight voltage bada-bing bada-boom

---------95:55----------
it works fixed so let's go over what was

---------96:02----------
wrong with this MacBook the first issue

---------96:04----------
that we had was that when I plugged it

---------96:07----------
in it was not showing anything on the

---------96:09----------
charger at all

---------96:10----------
I checked the area and it was a lot of

---------96:13----------
liquid damage and then just since at

---------96:16----------
some times I could get it to take a full

---------96:18----------
amp at 5 volts which is really weird I

---------96:20----------
thought there's a short to ground

---------96:21----------
probably somewhere on the input and I

---------96:23----------
checked the charger voltage coming into

---------96:25----------
the machine and the charger voltage

---------96:27----------
coming into the machine that power line

---------96:29----------
had 4 ohms to ground I tried to dig it

---------96:32----------
out of the charge port itself and by

---------96:34----------
digging into the corroded charge port I

---------96:35----------
then had 0 ohms to ground so I replaced

---------96:38----------
the charge port which is a painful

---------96:40----------
annoying process and it still wasn't

---------96:43----------
working it was giving me differences so

---------96:45----------
I changed the CD 30 to 15 however the

---------96:48----------
actual thing that I needed to do in

---------96:50----------
addition replace the CD 32 teens was

---------96:52----------
move my ROM chip because when I was

---------96:54----------
using the amount of heat that I need on

---------96:56----------
this board in order to get that charge

---------96:59----------
port to sit the way it needs to sit I

---------97:01----------
managed to move the ROM chip I moved the

---------97:04----------
ROM chip back into place and I was

---------97:06----------
getting 20 volts but it was only taking

---------97:08----------
80 milliamps which is not enough for it

---------97:09----------
to turn on I decided to check around the

---------97:11----------
power rails in the root in the board and

---------97:13----------
I started with ppbut g3 hot that's the

---------97:15----------
main power rail after a PP 3 V 3

---------97:16----------
underscore g3 how does present which

---------97:18----------
obviously it was because we're getting

---------97:19----------
20 volts in the board because he threads

---------97:20----------
you from teams which are powered by PB

---------97:21----------
300 G's

---------97:22----------
we're turning up this was pp much t3

---------97:24----------
hunt we needed to check that we saw that

---------97:26----------
that was 13 volts

---------97:27----------
once that was 13 volts then we go down

---------97:29----------
the line 55 es 5 P P 3 V 3 s 5 all of

---------97:32----------
those power rails were flickering that

---------97:34----------
tells me that there's something wrong

---------97:36----------
with a power whale that's related to

---------97:38----------
that chip so that line was going up down

---------97:40----------
up down up down because one of the lines

---------97:44----------
that that ship creates or that's created

---------97:46----------
downstream of the lines of that ship

---------97:48----------
creates for short it's a ground that's

---------97:49----------
the behavior that you get PP 5 es 5 or

---------97:51----------
PP 5 es 4 PP 3 P 3 is 5 going up down up

---------97:54----------
down up down up down up down up down up

---------97:55----------
down up down

---------97:56----------
die Corona die that is symptom of one of

---------98:00----------
those reading short to ground now PP 3 V

---------98:02----------
3 s 5 PP 5 es 4 PP e 3 3 is 5 all we're

---------98:05----------
not short to ground however you have to

---------98:07----------
keep in mind pp 3 v 3s form P P 3 P 3 or

---------98:09----------
so are created from PP 3 P 3 is 5 PP 5 v

---------98:12----------
es o is created from PP 5 es 4 so what

---------98:15----------
we did is we checked every other one of

---------98:17----------
those rails PP 3 B 3 s oh not shorted PP

---------98:20----------
3 PP e 5 ESO not short pp 3 V 3 S 4

---------98:24----------
shorted by the little cap that I

---------98:28----------
refurbished on the corner I tried to not

---------98:32----------
knock you off the board I wanted you to

---------98:34----------
have a seat at the table you betrayed me

---------98:37----------
shame yeah and you could tell that I

---------98:39----------
stayed at work late for this one because

---------98:41----------
I no longer have a mask on for those who

---------98:42----------
wonder when there are 14 employees and

---------98:45----------
three or five customers in the store I

---------98:47----------
have everybody wear a mask when I am by

---------98:49----------
myself and the store gate is closed the

---------98:52----------
door is closed then there's nobody here

---------98:53----------
in a 2,400 square foot space that has

---------98:55----------
air filters all over the place I do not

---------98:57----------
wear the mask the mask is not to protect

---------99:00----------
me the mask is to keep me from giving it

---------99:02----------
to others in the case that I got it and

---------99:03----------
it's very difficult to get a test very

---------99:05----------
difficult to know if you got it since

---------99:06----------
there is that two-week period where you

---------99:08----------
were not really symptomatic so again I

---------99:10----------
know I'm not wearing a mask in an empty

---------99:12----------
room I'm wearing a mask in a store with

---------99:15----------
14 or 17 or 20 people in it but when it

---------99:18----------
is 9:30 at night and nobody is here I

---------99:20----------
don't wear the mask and when I'm done I

---------99:24----------
like to take my little alcohol sprayer I

---------99:26----------
go all over my desk in the areas that I

---------99:28----------
was in I clean everything off from the

---------99:30----------
front counter to the door to the door

---------99:32----------
handle and all that and I go die Corona

---------99:34----------
died

---------99:35----------
feels good it's fun so that's it for

---------99:37----------
today in as always I hope you learned

---------99:40----------
something hi hi have fun editing this

---------99:42----------
one
