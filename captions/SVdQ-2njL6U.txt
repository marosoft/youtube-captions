---------00:00----------
hi this is Louis from Rossville repair

---------00:02----------
group in this video in a couple of

---------00:04----------
minutes you're going to watch me as I

---------00:06----------
solder and desolder a qfn component from

---------00:09----------
the board and the camera is going to be

---------00:11----------
zoomed upright on the board so you can

---------00:12----------
see exactly what I do I'm going to

---------00:15----------
remove a backlight chip from a unibody

---------00:17----------
MacBook motherboard and put a new one on

---------00:19----------
and with the hopes that I actually get

---------00:21----------
back like we've ultrasonic to clean this

---------00:23----------
board and it still manages to blow the

---------00:25----------
backlight fuse anytime a new one is put

---------00:27----------
on now there are a couple of videos on

---------00:29----------
how to do qfn soldering on youtube none

---------00:32----------
of them involved a computer motherboard

---------00:34----------
which is interesting to me because there

---------00:35----------
are a lot of them that do ball grid

---------00:37----------
array soldering of graphics chips there

---------00:39----------
are a lot of them to do DC jacks and

---------00:41----------
there are a lot of them doing basic

---------00:43----------
fuses and resistors and other standard

---------00:45----------
small components but I couldn't find any

---------00:47----------
doing QF ends on a motherboard for an

---------00:50----------
Apple computer I see a lot of them for

---------00:53----------
single layer boards for let's say audio

---------00:56----------
equipment and I see them with testing

---------00:59----------
boards or learning boards where you're

---------01:00----------
running solder through a channel to a

---------01:02----------
larger qfn chip and it's just not the

---------01:05----------
same if you watch one of these videos it

---------01:07----------
makes it look like it's incredibly easy

---------01:08----------
just apply that technique and you'll and

---------01:10----------
you'll be smooth sailing and if you've

---------01:14----------
tried to do that and you've wound up

---------01:16----------
here it's probably because you realize

---------01:17----------
that those techniques are or if Jack

---------01:20----------
ship when dealing with a Apple multiple

---------01:22----------
is again the pads are one the chips are

---------01:25----------
much smaller and the board is much more

---------01:27----------
populated along the sides now I'm not

---------01:29----------
saying this is the only way to do it I'm

---------01:30----------
just saying that if you're a beginner it

---------01:32----------
can't hurt to watch somebody do it on

---------01:34----------
the exact same board that you may be

---------01:36----------
about to work now

---------01:38----------
a couple of disclaimers the first is

---------01:40----------
that this is going to be an unedited

---------01:41----------
video that means that if I up in

---------01:44----------
any way I'm not going to edit it the

---------01:46----------
only edits that are going to be placed

---------01:47----------
here are due to the five-minute video

---------01:50----------
recording limitation of this Nikon

---------01:52----------
camera

---------01:53----------
that's meant for photographs not video

---------01:55----------
so if I make any mistake you'll be able

---------01:58----------
to see which is actually good because

---------02:00----------
people who are doing something for the

---------02:02----------
first time are inclined to mess

---------02:04----------
something up this way it will show you

---------02:06----------
where you should be more careful and it

---------02:08----------
will also show you how to fix whatever

---------02:09----------
you up should you happen to

---------02:10----------
something up and there's a good chance

---------02:12----------
that I may something up for a

---------02:14----------
couple of reasons the first is that it's

---------02:16----------
3:00 in the morning and I start work

---------02:18----------
around 9:00 to 11:00 in the morning so

---------02:20----------
I've been working for about 15 hours now

---------02:22----------
and this is what I do all day so not

---------02:24----------
only have I been doing this all day up

---------02:26----------
to this point but I've also been doing

---------02:28----------
this from the sunrise to eight hours

---------02:31----------
after the Sun has gone down so I'm

---------02:34----------
incredibly tired it's an amazing that I

---------02:36----------
mean it's still awake and the second

---------02:38----------
thing is that I don't have a steady hand

---------02:40----------
my hand shakes very often when I'm

---------02:42----------
holding something very still if I try to

---------02:44----------
hold this pen like a soldering iron in

---------02:49----------
focus keeping it steady

---------02:51----------
it won't stay stay so the point being if

---------02:54----------
I can do it then you most certainly can

---------02:56----------
do it doesn't need a little bit of

---------02:58----------
guidance and the third thing I'd like to

---------03:00----------
point out is that the reason in which

---------03:02----------
I'm not going to be using the standard

---------03:03----------
qfn or BGA soldering tactic running flux

---------03:08----------
along the pads and running a solder ball

---------03:10----------
around those a flux top pads I've

---------03:13----------
noticed that with new hires and trainees

---------03:15----------
they often somehow don't ask me why they

---------03:18----------
manage to rip the pants off in doing it

---------03:20----------
this way and I don't want you to wind up

---------03:23----------
ripping a pad off doing it that way I

---------03:25----------
like doing it that way it helps make up

---------03:27----------
the work done faster but I'm going to do

---------03:30----------
with the slow way which is going over

---------03:31----------
each individual pet after putting flux

---------03:34----------
on I'm going to go over each individual

---------03:36----------
pet I'm going to clean the tip of the

---------03:37----------
iron after going over a couple or even

---------03:39----------
each individual pad necessary and make

---------03:42----------
sure that the excess solder gets put on

---------03:43----------
the on the iron and make sure that each

---------03:45----------
pad looks good you can disagree with

---------03:47----------
this

---------03:48----------
I don't even agree with using this

---------03:49----------
tactic I'm only using it because it's

---------03:51----------
simple and it's easy for somebody who's

---------03:55----------
a beginner that being said let's get on

---------03:58----------
to the soldering and if you have any

---------03:59----------
questions comments ideas feel free to

---------04:01----------
post them in the comments

---------04:02----------
and I'll reply all right this is an a

---------04:08----------
1342 MacBook the white unibody

---------04:10----------
motherboard this is the chip that

---------04:12----------
controls or drives the backlight so

---------04:15----------
that's what we're going to have to

---------04:16----------
replace here since there is no backlight

---------04:18----------
and it repeatedly blows the fuses as we

---------04:21----------
replace them the first step before

---------04:23----------
replacing it is to prep the board now

---------04:26----------
see all this little crap over here that

---------04:29----------
is a ramp and also there's one that's

---------04:31----------
actually missing over here

---------04:39----------
lovely and then there's all this

---------04:42----------
nonsense this it all falls off very

---------04:45----------
easily because you need quite a bit of

---------04:48----------
heat to remove these QFN packages it's

---------04:52----------
possible that this has been worked on

---------04:53----------
before you never know that's a good hint

---------04:56----------
it could have came off when I got liquid

---------04:57----------
damaged the things been ultrasonic to

---------05:00----------
clean off all the crap on it it still

---------05:02----------
blows fuses

---------05:03----------
so next step is this thing now

---------05:09----------
this orange tape is called captain tape

---------05:11----------
spelled ka pto n captain tape is heat

---------05:15----------
resistant so if I put this tape over

---------05:18----------
here the components under it are not

---------05:19----------
going to get hot enough to get moved

---------05:22----------
around by the hot air station here this

---------05:27----------
is important because the last thing you

---------05:29----------
want to do at 3:00 in the morning is

---------05:31----------
hunt down which one of these is what

---------05:33----------
type of components are your is you know

---------05:36----------
you would point to ohm resistor or a 4

---------05:38----------
ohm resistor that you could try to find

---------05:41----------
one and put it there and hope that this

---------05:42----------
the only thing you blew off you really

---------05:44----------
don't want to deal with this at 3

---------05:46----------
in the morning so it's best to just put

---------05:48----------
this tape around all the crap that could

---------05:50----------
potentially fly away even though this

---------05:54----------
other stuff is larger and slightly

---------05:56----------
further away I am covering it because I

---------06:00----------
don't want to deal with it we're flying

---------06:02----------
away

---------06:08----------
now that those components are covered we

---------06:10----------
can get to the next step which is

---------06:12----------
preheating the board

---------06:21----------
[Music]

---------06:26----------
I'm waiting for my otter station ate up

---------06:28----------
here now a lot of the videos that you

---------06:31----------
may have seen have single layered boards

---------06:33----------
I know because I've looked before making

---------06:35----------
this video meaning that there's nothing

---------06:38----------
going on in between this layer and that

---------06:40----------
layer not only do these boards have many

---------06:42----------
layers it's also adept at absorbing heat

---------06:44----------
this entire board is comprised of heat

---------06:47----------
producing components your graphics chip

---------06:49----------
CPU voltage regulators this board makes

---------06:53----------
a lot of heat in addition

---------06:55----------
[Music]

---------06:59----------
now one thing that makes this board

---------07:01----------
different than the other board or you

---------07:03----------
know those test PC boards or training PC

---------07:06----------
boards this board absorbs heat it's

---------07:09----------
designed to absorb heat underneath each

---------07:11----------
one of these QFN packages is a heat sink

---------07:13----------
that absorbs heat because this here in a

---------07:17----------
way is an amplifier and those heat sinks

---------07:21----------
absorb the very heat that we need to

---------07:23----------
heat the solder pads next to it up to

---------07:25----------
remove the chip off the board and this

---------07:28----------
creates problems in addition this is

---------07:30----------
also a complicated PC board with many

---------07:32----------
layers to it and many of these layers

---------07:33----------
also happen to absorb the heat that

---------07:36----------
we're trying to use the ether chip so if

---------07:38----------
you just run up on the board and you

---------07:41----------
know put your iron over here like this

---------07:43----------
and expect to pull the chip off the

---------07:44----------
board it's not going to come off further

---------07:47----------
if you shock the board with a high level

---------07:49----------
of heating you're shocked this chip with

---------07:51----------
a high level of heat it's not actually

---------07:53----------
going to work afterwards this chip

---------07:55----------
assuming this chip was good before it

---------07:58----------
will be dead you'll notice it start to

---------08:00----------
rise at the top and bevel until it

---------08:02----------
finally cracks you you need to have

---------08:05----------
every component heated evenly just

---------08:06----------
because this chip is four or five

---------08:08----------
hundred degrees doesn't mean it's going

---------08:09----------
to come off the board if the solder pads

---------08:11----------
themselves are not hot enough to

---------08:12----------
actually melt because all the heats

---------08:13----------
being absorbed what you want to do is

---------08:15----------
heat all of these layers evenly I want

---------08:17----------
the middle layer of the board

---------08:19----------
bottom of the board I want all the stuff

---------08:20----------
around it to not be at a high enough

---------08:24----------
temperature to melt solder but I want it

---------08:25----------
to be right on the cusp of being able to

---------08:27----------
melt solder so that when I do finally

---------08:30----------
decide to go in on this chip and heat it

---------08:33----------
up enough to remove it it only takes a

---------08:35----------
couple of seconds and I'm not using a

---------08:37----------
really high temperature to do it so

---------08:40----------
let's go ahead and get to removing the

---------08:41----------
chip

---------08:41----------
[Music]

---------08:46----------
iron is heated up at decent amount we're

---------08:48----------
going to start with preheating the board

---------08:49----------
so about like one or two inches away

---------08:51----------
hold the iron

---------09:00----------
I'm going to adjust my chair here so it

---------09:02----------
doesn't hit this cheap-ass tripod that

---------09:04----------
I'm using all the camera

---------09:11----------
I'm gonna hold it here for about a

---------09:13----------
minute and a half and preheating the

---------09:15----------
board is a good thing don't be afraid to

---------09:17----------
preheat the board be afraid to mutilate

---------09:19----------
the board from excessive heat but don't

---------09:21----------
be afraid to use a slightly lower

---------09:23----------
temperature and keep it on these boards

---------09:26----------
are made to absorb heat and they're made

---------09:29----------
for a mass manufacturing process which

---------09:31----------
is worse than almost anything I can be

---------09:33----------
doing right

---------09:54----------
the more preheating we do now from a

---------09:56----------
safe distance the easier it's going to

---------09:57----------
be to remove the chip and the less

---------09:59----------
likely we are to rip anything off the

---------10:00----------
board in the process

---------10:28----------
now once we actually get close in on the

---------10:30----------
chip you don't want to start picking it

---------10:32----------
up like this

---------10:34----------
the reason is some of these solder pads

---------10:36----------
could be wet and ready for you to remove

---------10:38----------
the chip and some of them could still be

---------10:39----------
stuck so if you wind up using any sort

---------10:41----------
of force to remove the chip you could

---------10:42----------
actually be ripping the solder pads off

---------10:44----------
the board for the pads that are still

---------10:46----------
soldered to the chip what you want to do

---------10:48----------
once you start heating it up is

---------10:51----------
something like this you're going to push

---------10:54----------
the chip like this and once you push it

---------10:57----------
you know that it's hot then you go in

---------10:59----------
for the kill and then rip it up now I

---------11:02----------
obviously can't stay you know stay there

---------11:05----------
doing that unless I'm using a sample

---------11:06----------
board since this is a board that I'd

---------11:08----------
actually like to work again now what I

---------11:10----------
did was first thing I did is touch it

---------11:13----------
now once I see that it moves I know that

---------11:17----------
every single pad is loose and that I can

---------11:19----------
pull it up if I were to simply pull this

---------11:20----------
up like that if ever just simply just

---------11:22----------
take this chip and pull it up off the

---------11:24----------
board all these pads could be ready to

---------11:26----------
go but if two or three pads here kind of

---------11:28----------
cold if I'll rip them off the board and

---------11:31----------
then you get into a situation where

---------11:32----------
you're running microscopic wires from

---------11:34----------
this to that resistor begin trying to

---------11:37----------
guess also which one of these pads

---------11:39----------
shorts to which components are going

---------11:40----------
through 70 pages of schematics again

---------11:42----------
things you don't want to do with two or

---------11:44----------
three in the morning you just sew just

---------11:46----------
touch tap the chip enough to move it as

---------11:49----------
soon as you've tapped it enough to move

---------11:50----------
it just to ensure that it stays hot and

---------11:52----------
that it for some strange reason it

---------11:53----------
doesn't get cold and wind up sticking

---------11:55----------
again put your soldering iron you know a

---------11:57----------
tiny bit closer leave it there for half

---------11:59----------
a second and then pull it up that's a

---------12:01----------
safe procedure next what we have to do

---------12:04----------
is work on these pads here because now

---------12:07----------
summat like some of them like this one

---------12:09----------
here have virtually no solder left on

---------12:11----------
them some of these have uneven solder

---------12:14----------
joints left on them I want each one of

---------12:16----------
these pads to have the same amount of

---------12:18----------
solder almost the same amount of solder

---------12:20----------
on them I want it to be even and I want

---------12:22----------
it to be fresh with fresh flux what flux

---------12:25----------
does is it allows the solder to begin to

---------12:28----------
flow without flux solder doesn't flow

---------12:31----------
like a regular liquid it's kind of

---------12:33----------
like you know a dirty goo that stays

---------12:36----------
somewhere and sticks that's why when

---------12:38----------
you're actually soldering something you

---------12:40----------
should always be adding solder and then

---------12:42----------
taking the iron away you should never

---------12:43----------
add solder then keep the iron there

---------12:45----------
because when you see going up in the air

---------12:47----------
that smoke is actually the flux burning

---------12:49----------
away and when the flux burns away the

---------12:51----------
solder no longer flows which is how you

---------12:53----------
get cold solder joints a cold solder

---------12:55----------
joint is when there's a crack in the

---------12:57----------
side of the joint in some location that

---------13:00----------
keeps it from allowing the chip the wire

---------13:03----------
whatever the lead or whatever it is from

---------13:05----------
touching the solder pad all right so

---------13:10----------
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add

---------13:12----------
some flux here this is a Kester 951 no

---------13:16----------
clean flux pen but they can't get it

---------13:19----------
focused in the cam here it's a pretty

---------13:21----------
cool device shake it and it lets out

---------13:25----------
this flux right along the area I prefer

---------13:27----------
the pen for these applications I prefer

---------13:31----------
the pen to just the dropper because it

---------13:33----------
also serves to wipe off crap on the

---------13:37----------
board any sort of dirt or anything

---------13:39----------
that's going to keep me from doing my

---------13:40----------
job so move this around a little bit

---------13:44----------
[Music]

---------13:51----------
now I'm going to get to work now what

---------13:53----------
also this middle pad as I mentioned

---------13:55----------
before that's a heatsink so we think of

---------13:57----------
this like a CPU and thermal paste that

---------14:00----------
solder blob there is what's allowing the

---------14:02----------
bottom pad of the chip which creates the

---------14:05----------
heat to make contact with this now if

---------14:08----------
there's no solder there it's going to be

---------14:10----------
boiling because the chip is not going to

---------14:12----------
make contact with the heatsink if

---------14:14----------
there's too much solder there I'm not

---------14:15----------
going to be able to put the chip on

---------14:16----------
properly because that solder is going to

---------14:18----------
run out the side I wind up shorting one

---------14:20----------
pad to another and just creating a rapid

---------14:22----------
mess so I don't want to add any solder

---------14:25----------
to there if there's a decent amount

---------14:27----------
already then so what I'm going to do is

---------14:33----------
I'm going to try to solder outwards I've

---------14:37----------
put this camera at a shitty angle

---------14:44----------
[Music]

---------14:47----------
you notice I'm not just dragging one

---------14:49----------
solder blob over I'm adding a little bit

---------14:53----------
on each one because I want the flux to

---------14:56----------
be fresh on each one

---------14:59----------
[Music]

---------15:08----------
what you could do as well you could

---------15:11----------
simple if you have a good solder like

---------15:13----------
this this is a caster let it solder with

---------15:17----------
no clean flux inside of it you could

---------15:20----------
just you know do a big ball and roll it

---------15:23----------
everywhere the only reason I'm not doing

---------15:24----------
it here is because I found with trainees

---------15:26----------
and beginners that when they do that

---------15:28----------
they always manage to up a pad or

---------15:31----------
get us out or blob somewhere on the

---------15:33----------
board yeah that and if you've seen it in

---------15:35----------
a video before it is something you can

---------15:37----------
do I would just discourage doing it

---------15:39----------
until you've done this a couple of times

---------15:41----------
and made it work

---------15:41----------
then go along and do it the quicker and

---------15:44----------
easier way

---------15:50----------
[Music]

---------15:58----------
[Music]

---------16:13----------
looking at your work from the top is not

---------16:15----------
going to tell you because we're

---------16:17----------
looking to see it we've got some decent

---------16:19----------
solder bumps on every pad and looking at

---------16:21----------
it from the top

---------16:22----------
you don't get any sense of the height or

---------16:25----------
the shape you just get a sense that

---------16:26----------
there's still silver doesn't really help

---------16:30----------
[Music]

---------16:59----------
one of my personal weaknesses is being a

---------17:01----------
perfectionist

---------17:02----------
even if I actually have it so that it's

---------17:04----------
good enough that the chip will sit there

---------17:06----------
and work forever

---------17:07----------
I still want every single pad to be

---------17:09----------
perfect so hopefully you're a little

---------17:11----------
less OCD ish than I am again I could

---------17:13----------
have been done a minute ago and why I'm

---------17:16----------
still going about this is beyond me I

---------17:18----------
guess I just like knowing that it looks

---------17:21----------
good

---------17:23----------
[Music]

---------17:48----------
[Music]

---------17:59----------
okay I'm happy with this now we get to

---------18:02----------
put in the chip back on the board all

---------18:06----------
right

---------18:07----------
now I like to clean the flux off with a

---------18:10----------
little bit alcohol on a q-tip it makes

---------18:13----------
it easier to see when the solder is

---------18:15----------
finally molten

---------18:33----------
this tape is beat the so I'm going

---------18:36----------
to put a new set on

---------18:39----------
just on these two sides that have all

---------18:41----------
the small stuff

---------19:30----------
okay I'm going to create the board a

---------19:32----------
little bit on put my chip

---------19:40----------
well I like to be right on top of the

---------19:43----------
chip so that when I'm laying it down I

---------19:44----------
can really tell exactly that I'm getting

---------19:50----------
a right spot

---------20:23----------
okay it's go time

---------20:50----------
[Music]

---------22:29----------
and the interests of realism I did put

---------22:32----------
the chip on the board I did put it on

---------22:33----------
incredibly crooked because I have an

---------22:35----------
unsteady hand so I decided to heat it

---------22:38----------
again and just move it back into place

---------22:40----------
there's the theory that the surface

---------22:43----------
tension is enough that you could just

---------22:44----------
drop the chip on there and it will

---------22:45----------
connect I wish this were true I have

---------22:49----------
better luck placing it on the board from

---------22:51----------
directly above the chip so I'm looking

---------22:53----------
exactly at it so I can see on each end

---------22:56----------
if there is solder pad sticking out it's

---------22:59----------
supposed to be even you shouldn't like

---------23:01----------
though for example the left solder pad

---------23:03----------
should not be all covered with the right

---------23:04----------
side or pad showing you want the chip to

---------23:06----------
be perfectly centered now I didn't put

---------23:08----------
it on perfectly so I just so happen to

---------23:10----------
heat it again

---------23:11----------
move it a little bit now the third thing

---------23:13----------
you can do if you have an incredibly

---------23:15----------
unsteady hand with me it's kind of

---------23:16----------
cheating so throw some flux on there

---------23:22----------
I do this just because I like saying

---------23:24----------
100% perfect joints

---------23:37----------
if you have an iron that's thin enough

---------23:39----------
that you can actually get underneath the

---------23:41----------
chip a little bit and some good no clean

---------23:46----------
flux solder just do this this also helps

---------23:52----------
get rid of any small solder balls let's

---------23:54----------
say that the heatsink had too much

---------23:57----------
solder on it instead of having to go in

---------23:58----------
and redo everything and I just put a

---------24:00----------
little flux on there and do this and the

---------24:02----------
solder will get absorbed onto the iron

---------24:04----------
equating your ion as you go every single

---------24:07----------
time you do this

---------24:07----------
[Music]

---------25:02----------
[Music]

---------25:10----------
after that I'll give it a some cleaning

---------25:12----------
with some alcohol

---------25:13----------
[Music]

---------26:09----------
all right here's the final part of our

---------26:11----------
video and the fun part which is seeing

---------26:12----------
if the you did actually works this

---------26:15----------
is the white unibody MacBook it doesn't

---------26:17----------
have a hard drive in it

---------26:18----------
I haven't plugged in anything no

---------26:20----------
speakers I can see I got a screen that

---------26:24----------
lights up so I'm happy
