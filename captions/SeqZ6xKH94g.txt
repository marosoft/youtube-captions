---------00:00----------
all right here we're getting started on

---------00:01----------
another MacBook this MacBook appears to

---------00:04----------
have had a a vase that fell on it and

---------00:06----------
spilled water on it and as a result of

---------00:09----------
the spilled water it no longer works

---------00:11----------
let's get this MacBook on the desk and

---------00:14----------
see if we can figure it out okay let's

---------00:21----------
take a look at this little MacBook all

---------00:23----------
right so this is gonna be the SMC reset

---------00:25----------
chip which is responsible for turning

---------00:28----------
the SMC on and as you can see it's been

---------00:31----------
violently attacked so this chip over

---------00:35----------
here is you 5110 sn0 903 zero four nine

---------00:41----------
if we needed this chip if we needed an

---------00:44----------
SN zero nine zero three zero forty nine

---------00:48----------
where could we go if we needed one of

---------00:51----------
these chips what would we do

---------00:53----------
perhaps you can head on over to store

---------00:57----------
dot Rossmann and group.com the number

---------01:00----------
one result on Google for Au 5110 SMC

---------01:03----------
reset I see for the new MacBook

---------01:05----------
motherboards don't delay check out store

---------01:08----------
dot Rosman group.com today you can even

---------01:11----------
save a percent on your order if you

---------01:13----------
decide to buy five chips rather than one

---------01:15----------
and you'll meet them folks this chip

---------01:17----------
also works on the MacBook Air which has

---------01:20----------
the SMC reset circuitry right on the

---------01:22----------
edge of the machine where the water is

---------01:24----------
always likely to get in don't delay make

---------01:27----------
sure that you head over to store dot

---------01:29----------
Rossman group.com for all of your board

---------01:31----------
repair needs today we even have a UV

---------01:34----------
light curing pen oh yeah look at that

---------01:38----------
look at that curing pen this great new

---------01:42----------
product from store dot rossmann group

---------01:44----------
com

---------02:40----------
it's powered by triple A's test UK

---------02:55----------
that is Magento diga

---------03:03----------
all right as can be seen here we have a

---------03:05----------
pad that looks like it's seen better

---------03:08----------
days let's take a look at this little

---------03:10----------
pad oh my well this is a pad we may be

---------03:18----------
able to revive rather than have to run a

---------03:22----------
jumper but it's still a pad that's seen

---------03:27----------
better days

---------03:28----------
wonder what that pad is for what do you

---------03:35----------
know that's the P P 3 V 4 2 pad where PP

---------03:38----------
3 V 4 2 is going to come into my chip

---------03:46----------
and that people that also goes to a

---------03:48----------
capacitor up here which also looks like

---------03:52----------
garbage

---------04:05----------
maybe we will run a jumper wire after

---------04:07----------
all it's none of this is trustworthy

---------04:15----------
what a board scold Aleta Podesta pads no

---------04:22----------
Sara

---------04:35----------
[Music]

---------04:38----------
I get my donor boards and some vendors

---------04:42----------
in China that will sell them to me

---------04:49----------
they're probably going to the trashcan

---------04:52----------
at the factory and sneaking things out

---------05:00----------
[Music]

---------05:20----------
and apparently there's a resistor that

---------05:22----------
used to be above here

---------05:44----------
oh my god that's destroyed

---------06:42----------
[Music]

---------07:38----------
chia-pet the pottery that grows

---------07:44----------
spread the seeds soak your cheetah and

---------07:48----------
watch it grow

---------07:57----------
spread the seeds spread the seeds and

---------07:59----------
watch it grow

---------08:19----------
all right so

---------08:35----------
what's the name of the game dad I doubt

---------08:42----------
it

---------08:48----------
I love Abba Abbas so great I never had a

---------08:56----------
chia pet and I never had an iPhone 4 and

---------09:00----------
I probably never will

---------09:17----------
- to TIA

---------09:23----------
- to TIA

---------09:28----------
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu tear

---------10:00----------
okay that should be good next up this

---------10:03----------
lovely clock chip so we should get a

---------10:05----------
Green Line the charger at this point but

---------10:07----------
we're still going to have an issue of it

---------10:08----------
not turning on because the chip that

---------10:10----------
creates our clock signal looks like this

---------10:30----------
hello

---------10:33----------
hello

---------10:37----------
[Music]

---------10:39----------
yes

---------10:44----------
[Music]

---------10:46----------
this is Paul

---------11:48----------
I thought I was done but it dragged me

---------11:55----------
back in oh my god I want to go back to

---------12:05----------
work no worries you have a good day all

---------12:17----------
right

---------12:30----------
yeah same here TC RS but you just gotta

---------12:33----------
deal with it smile say thank you

---------12:36----------
I usually just hit the mute button on my

---------12:38----------
phone and start cursing or throwing

---------12:41----------
stuff around the desk it helps it

---------12:44----------
definitely helps because if you don't

---------12:45----------
say anything you'll just lose your mind

---------12:49----------
that's what the mute button on the phone

---------12:51----------
is for

---------12:57----------
so the thing is Heather some people need

---------13:00----------
to call in because they need to have

---------13:02----------
their balls tickled and all that

---------13:04----------
before they allow you to work on it a

---------13:07----------
lot of people are not calling in to W

---------13:09----------
know for the price they're calling in

---------13:10----------
because they want to make sure there's a

---------13:12----------
person on the other end of the phone and

---------13:13----------
sometimes people just need their balls

---------13:15----------
tickled a little bit before they send

---------13:17----------
something in whether your titties

---------13:19----------
twisted and you know whatever whatever

---------13:20----------
it is we're equal opportunity here and

---------13:23----------
you get Escada and you just got it in

---------13:25----------
that case I just had to tickle those

---------13:27----------
balls a little bit to get them to send

---------13:28----------
it in and you know it's part of it it's

---------13:30----------
part of what they're paying for

---------14:08----------
no that's fine you just got to do a

---------14:10----------
little bit of ball tickling every now

---------14:11----------
and then

---------14:15----------
exactly

---------14:16----------
frost claw gets the idea Lewis

---------14:18----------
understands me and my MacBook they have

---------14:20----------
to feel like you are they the person on

---------14:22----------
the other end needs to feel like you

---------14:24----------
understand them in their MacBook and

---------14:26----------
their specific situation that is very

---------14:29----------
specific to them

---------14:30----------
even though you've seen it a million

---------14:32----------
trillion times before and it's all the

---------14:34----------
same but it's you just got to do

---------14:37----------
the ball tickling and if you're not

---------14:38----------
willing to do the ball tickling but

---------14:40----------
somebody else will do the ball tickling

---------14:42----------
and the book and the other ball tickler

---------14:43----------
will get the business you know stuff

---------14:48----------
nothing wrong with a little bit of ball

---------14:49----------
tickling every now and then

---------15:05----------
I can totally see nasarah as the type of

---------15:07----------
person that does not want to seem rude

---------15:09----------
which is why your conversations are

---------15:11----------
probably going to go on forever

---------15:27----------
let's switch tips here

---------15:38----------
that jtag port was not innocent it had

---------15:41----------
to go you may think that jtag port was

---------15:44----------
innocent but it was not there is no such

---------15:46----------
thing as an innocent jtag connector

---------15:47----------
that's what's meant by tickle down

---------15:49----------
economics exactly yeah you tickle the

---------15:51----------
balls of your customers and you wind up

---------15:53----------
making more money

---------15:54----------
tickle down economics that's how it

---------15:57----------
works

---------15:57----------
[Music]

---------16:00----------
clearly you haven't read enough Thomas

---------16:02----------
soul

---------16:28----------
[Music]

---------17:13----------
the last three pens are all the same

---------17:14----------
things so if they're bridged I don't

---------17:16----------
care

---------17:25----------
let's see if this little MacBook has

---------17:27----------
been fixed

---------17:36----------
I get no light in the charger and zero

---------17:39----------
amps are drawn hmm that's

---------17:42----------
because we spent quite a bit of time on

---------17:43----------
this all right

---------17:44----------
this loves two shorts in the middle do i

---------17:49----------
well crap I do that wouldn't cause me to

---------17:54----------
have no green light but you got to get

---------17:56----------
used to this new tip choice like I'm

---------18:00----------
really I'm very used to that one that

---------18:02----------
has the hole on the bottom of it the

---------18:03----------
flat one because it absorbs the extra

---------18:05----------
solder rather than just moving it around

---------18:06----------
I kind of like that one I miss it very

---------18:10----------
much now we'll just move somewhere else

---------18:15----------
at I chillax you're not gonna burn

---------18:18----------
by shorting two pins on an LCD connector

---------18:21----------
it's no big deal

---------18:22----------
chillax man all right so let's take a

---------18:26----------
look and see what we're getting here

---------18:33----------
first let's make sure my charger is

---------18:35----------
coming in sure is the input to my PP 3

---------18:39----------
before 2 circuit is 18 volts

---------18:47----------
Alex

---------18:52----------
Alex Danna

---------18:58----------
how can I help you back to the pp three

---------19:07----------
before to circuit so we have 18 volts

---------19:10----------
come in we have three point four volts

---------19:13----------
coming out our pp bus is twelve point

---------19:17----------
three which means our SMC is not turning

---------19:19----------
on all right the first thing to do let's

---------19:24----------
see if our SMC reset circuit is putting

---------19:27----------
out an SMC reset signal over here is our

---------19:29----------
SMC reset signal so it's not being told

---------19:32----------
to turn on great three point four volts

---------19:36----------
going into the SMC chip zero coming out

---------19:42----------
of it three point four volts on this

---------19:45----------
side of the resistor is zero volts on

---------19:48----------
that side three point four yeah

---------20:03----------
3.13 that's not right you're a broken

---------20:10----------
trace so this is going to be that this

---------20:13----------
has to connect to this pin down here and

---------20:16----------
this trace looks awfully questionable

---------20:22----------
yeah look this doesn't go anywhere this

---------20:25----------
is all broken all right so let's run a

---------20:29----------
wire to a little jumper wire so missus

---------20:35----------
can you read Hebrew I have no idea how

---------20:37----------
to read Hebrew

---------22:46----------
green-light fan spin

---------22:50----------
finally fan spin something that works it

---------22:55----------
took long enough look at that look at

---------23:01----------
that it works it works it works yes

---------23:15----------
when win fans spin do you have a MacBook

---------23:18----------
