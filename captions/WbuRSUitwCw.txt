hi so we have here a 1706

---------00:04----------
and what happens a lot with these when

---------00:07----------
you get liquid damage you'll get a

---------00:09----------
question mark folder from the machine

---------00:12----------
once you once you get everything back up

---------00:13----------
and running change CD 32 15s get the

---------00:15----------
power back on you'll wind up with a

---------00:17----------
question mark folder now there's a

---------00:19----------
couple things that you should look at on

---------00:21----------
here one is always happens on every

---------00:27----------
single one that we've ever done on these

---------00:28----------
we take a look at this corner of the

---------00:30----------
board right here so we have this jumble

---------00:38----------
of signals and resistors and things

---------00:41----------
going back and forth here there is a

---------00:44----------
probe point so now this trace is in a

---------00:52----------
very important trace it's v-27 and it

---------00:56----------
starts over here so it comes through the

---------00:58----------
board layers right over here and they

---------01:00----------
ran it all the way down along here

---------01:02----------
there's a probe point and then a

---------01:06----------
resistor that it goes through where it

---------01:07----------
goes to the buck converters to create

---------01:12----------
the two point seven volts to run the

---------01:14----------
NAND this probe point right here this

---------01:19----------
humble little probe point goes bad

---------01:26----------
99.999% times you won't see it sometimes

---------01:31----------
this is this this one trolled one of our

---------01:34----------
other texts here for a little while he

---------01:37----------
changed a bunch of other stuff not

---------01:39----------
realizing it was a full probe point it

---------01:40----------
looked full except you can tell there

---------01:43----------
was a discoloration right before the

---------01:47----------
right before the resist starts right

---------01:51----------
here there was a weird discoloration and

---------01:54----------
as soon as you poked into the resist it

---------01:58----------
did it just crumbled away and there was

---------02:01----------
no trace left underneath it so the trace

---------02:03----------
was no longer connected to the probe

---------02:06----------
point which stopped the feet b27

---------02:10----------
or you know v27 and enable

---------02:13----------
from getting to the buck converter

---------02:30----------
so that right there and go to a wider

---------02:33----------
view it's in this this corner here right

---------02:39----------
on the wing right up there water gets in

---------02:42----------
through the vents here or I think it

---------02:46----------
comes through the keyboard to on the

---------02:47----------
other side it always winds up right here

---------02:49----------
like what always winds up right here and

---------02:53----------
it always burns out that I don't know if

---------02:56----------
that stays on for longer than everything

---------02:57----------
else would why why would it corrode so

---------02:59----------
quick and then we fixed that

---------03:13----------
we went from question mark folder

---------03:36----------
- there it is

---------03:40----------
I can Tosh HD showing right there

---------03:49----------
so we've said it before I haven't heard

---------03:51----------
it said in a long time always check your

---------03:53----------
probe points probe points throw a troll

---------03:55----------
everybody at some time or another

---------03:57----------
always anywhere where you saw a liquid

---------03:59----------
damage check your probe points really

---------04:01----------
well poke them in the corners make sure

---------04:03----------
that they haven't disintegrated

---------04:06----------
underneath because the gold plating of

---------04:08----------
the probe point should resist most

---------04:10----------
corrosion but as soon as you get away

---------04:13----------
from that gold when you get underneath

---------04:14----------
the resist a little bit or right around

---------04:16----------
the edges the copper the exposed copper

---------04:18----------
will corrode very quickly a lot faster

---------04:21----------
than the gold or the solder will so

---------04:25----------
always poke the edges in your probe

---------04:27----------
points especially when it has something

---------04:28----------
going straight through it pro points

---------04:33----------
