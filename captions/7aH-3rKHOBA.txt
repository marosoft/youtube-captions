---------00:02----------
hi so today we're gonna be going over

---------00:04----------
another board that was up by an

---------00:06----------
idiot I don't know if the board

---------00:07----------
necessarily was up by an idiot or

---------00:09----------
if the screen repair was up by an

---------00:10----------
idiot but the screen repair that was

---------00:12----------
 up by an idiot

---------00:13----------
most definitely caused a border pair to

---------00:15----------
be up so what we're gonna be

---------00:16----------
going over here is one of the things

---------00:20----------
risks that you take when you use the

---------00:22----------
wrong type of LCD connector for your

---------00:24----------
particular machine also I have very

---------00:26----------
little faith that this video will

---------00:27----------
actually be in sync because I am

---------00:29----------
rendering another video while I'm

---------00:31----------
recording this one so even though I set

---------00:33----------
it to only use one core for the

---------00:35----------
rendering and I put open broadcast at a

---------00:38----------
real-time priority let's face it this is

---------00:40----------
this is Windows and I'm multitasking

---------00:42----------
while doing real-time video recording so

---------00:44----------
I have very little faith that this will

---------00:47----------
work the way I want it to but let's see

---------00:50----------
this with any luck we actually have

---------00:53----------
video sync so let me just shrink myself

---------00:55----------
so that I can show you what's in the

---------00:56----------
microscope camera what have I done to

---------00:59----------
open broadcast yourself right come on

---------01:01----------
yeah go over here snap to the grid snap

---------01:05----------
to the grid very good okay so you're

---------01:08----------
gonna see over here is a sad little

---------01:10----------
 up mess let's turn the light down

---------01:15----------
so it's viewable properly so this is a

---------01:16----------
2012 LCD cable going into a 2011

---------01:20----------
connector and the thing is it is

---------01:23----------
possible to jerry-rig this to fit I've

---------01:25----------
mentioned it on I fix it a couple of

---------01:27----------
times that you can jerry-rig it to fit

---------01:28----------
but here's what happens when you don't

---------01:30----------
jerry-rigged it properly

---------01:31----------
see that little exploded [ __ ]

---------01:34----------
there let me show you what that's

---------01:35----------
supposed to look like on a board that

---------01:36----------
wasn't this by an idiot so it

---------01:39----------
will look something like this now what

---------01:41----------
we're missing on this other board are

---------01:43----------
you and you and let's just take a look

---------01:49----------
and keep in mind I have not added flux

---------01:51----------
here yet I have not done a damn thing

---------01:53----------
and it looks like that so not only did

---------01:55----------
this person who brought it in you know

---------01:59----------
who told me that it just randomly

---------02:01----------
stopped working not only was it

---------02:02----------
with by an idiot not only was the person

---------02:04----------
I was speaking to the idiot but they

---------02:07----------
also didn't tell me that they tried to

---------02:10----------
do anything to it before which means you

---------02:13----------
which means you get bottom of the pile

---------02:17----------
treatment from me yeah as saying you can

---------02:21----------
 up that's fine just don't lie about

---------02:23----------
it I mean like I'm charging you anyway

---------02:25----------
just keep this though just keep it in

---------02:28----------
mind same like Apple or it's like if it

---------02:30----------
dies for no reason it's free and if it

---------02:32----------
dies because of water at 700 bucks no my

---------02:34----------
rates are static I don't give a

---------02:36----------
what you did to it if it doesn't work I

---------02:39----------
really I really don't care I think I'm

---------02:41----------
gonna be charging you a static rate

---------02:42----------
based on what I do it has nothing to do

---------02:45----------
with how it died or what you did so you

---------02:49----------
know I'm gonna I'm gonna get the money

---------02:50----------
anyway so there's no reason to lie or

---------02:53----------
what the only thing that lying is going

---------02:54----------
to do is it's going to motivate me to

---------02:57----------
put your thing which I'm charging you're

---------02:59----------
gonna be by the way the same money as

---------03:00----------
everybody else I'm just gonna take it

---------03:01----------
from this point of the pile and it's

---------03:03----------
gonna go like to the bottom of the pile

---------03:04----------
and that's that's that so let's try to

---------03:07----------
see if we can even see if there's any

---------03:10----------
place that we can attach this stuff to

---------03:13----------
anymore so those two things that failed

---------03:15----------
we're just gonna go over here onto the

---------03:17----------
board view I'll show you okay so these

---------03:20----------
are the two things that are missing so

---------03:22----------
we got cl9 0 0 4 ml 9 0 0 8 now online 0

---------03:30----------
0 4 doesn't even really look like it has

---------03:31----------
pins for anything anymore well it's yeah

---------03:37----------
that looks pretty cool on the screen

---------03:39----------
right now so l9 0 0 4 + l 9 0 0 8 ok l 9

---------03:52----------
0 0 4 comes from the u 9000 chip over

---------03:56----------
here which tells which is the 3.3 volts

---------03:59----------
to get the screen turning on and l 9 0 0

---------04:02----------
8 is going to pin 4 which is a different

---------04:07----------
3 volt rail for the LCD okay so how are

---------04:13----------
we going to structure this

---------04:23----------
well there's still pull-up resistors

---------04:25----------
therefore the data line so let's see so

---------04:27----------
online zero zero eight is gonna be L

---------04:34----------
nine zero zero eight is this thing nine

---------04:36----------
zero zero four is this thing so the L

---------04:38----------
nine zero zero four I think is the one

---------04:39----------
that's really gonna be beyond hope here

---------04:41----------
so let's just bring the microscope back

---------04:43----------
up yeah so this is L nine zero zero for

---------04:48----------
this line along here that's the

---------04:54----------
that really looks like it's it's beyond

---------04:56----------
hope Ã¡ndale nine zero zero eight is the

---------05:00----------
one over here which is not not beyond

---------05:02----------
hope at all

---------05:02----------
so let's get to soldering and see what

---------05:04----------
we can do shall we fix this another

---------05:08----------
 up DIY mess now somebody I know

---------05:12----------
he's a he's really smart with this he

---------05:15----------
says you know can you really blame the

---------05:17----------
fact that all you get are up

---------05:18----------
messes from other repair shops and

---------05:20----------
do-it-yourself people F I can't you

---------05:22----------
blame anybody but yourself with this

---------05:23----------
channel and it he's kind of trolling but

---------05:25----------
it is the truth I mean like I mean easy

---------05:28----------
jobs rest in peace I mean this this is

---------05:31----------
the consequence of giving people

---------05:32----------
knowledge it's yeah that they will do it

---------05:38----------
and if and nothing nothing is simple

---------05:42----------
anymore no no this is what said no easy

---------05:49----------
jobs just up messes so what are

---------05:54----------
we gonna do it here

---------06:19----------
this is gonna be the easy one no

---------06:22----------
something tells me you something around

---------06:23----------
the you 7000 you 9000 area is not gonna

---------06:28----------
work the way it's supposed to dance that

---------06:41----------
was really that's like a clean break

---------06:43----------
right there again this is what it's

---------06:44----------
supposed to look like in a working one

---------06:46----------
just to is just gone

---------07:08----------
now the 3-volt the thing is this is most

---------07:11----------
of the minute idiot who really left this

---------07:12----------
let this sit here because here's the

---------07:14----------
thing you got to know about the PP 3v3

---------07:16----------
that's a power supply that you can

---------07:18----------
actually short to ground you know to

---------07:20----------
smoke it's not gonna blow up immediately

---------07:22----------
P P 3 V 3 is not going to just you know

---------07:25----------
blow up and the power supply doesn't

---------07:26----------
work it'll smoke for a while so you got

---------07:29----------
a lead you know this this must have been

---------07:31----------
left smoking for a good period of time

---------09:38----------
okay let's see if there's progress or

---------09:43----------
smoke what do you think is gonna be

---------09:45----------
progress for smoke

---------10:12----------
look what you did to your LCD jackass

---------10:16----------
yeah sad

---------10:20----------
okay well Boyd repair I'm done this is

---------10:27----------
where this goes back to the

---------10:29----------
do-it-yourselfer and I go have fun

---------10:32----------
and again do-it-yourselfer that failed

---------10:34----------
and brought it totally cool with that

---------10:36----------
and I don't prefer working on them but

---------10:39----------
you know I get it

---------10:40----------
do-it-yourselfer that lied blame

---------10:43----------
somebody else in addition to blaming

---------10:45----------
somebody else also lied to me about the

---------10:46----------
history of everything and went above and

---------10:48----------
beyond to as we questioned yeah done and

---------10:54----------
that's about that you're on your own as

---------10:59----------
soon as you lie
