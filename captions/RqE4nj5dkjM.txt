---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:02----------
we're gonna get started fixing it

---------00:03----------
another bad MacBook first thing we're

---------00:05----------
gonna do is just gonna remove the kovat

---------00:07----------
from this MacBook MacBooks often have

---------00:10----------
kovat all over them right so the first

---------00:16----------
thing you notice with this board the

---------00:20----------
airbags air bags air bags so let's see

---------00:28----------
what's this thing doing I'm not gonna

---------00:29----------
plug in the battery because I don't want

---------00:31----------
to I don't want anything to do with that

---------00:33----------
battery blowing up in my face

---------00:59----------
I heard a chime and I see an Apple logo

---------01:01----------
but there's no backlight so the problem

---------01:03----------
with this machine is that it has no

---------01:05----------
backlight so the first thing I'm going

---------01:07----------
to do is what is the backlight voltage

---------01:10----------
what are we measuring here the backlight

---------01:17----------
voltage measured is zero volts okay fair

---------01:21----------
enough

---------01:28----------
now the backlight fuse on this model is

---------01:30----------
never going to go bad because it's a

---------01:31----------
current sensing circuit and as you can

---------01:36----------
see we've got a fine backlight fuse

---------01:38----------
there

---------01:40----------
so let's unplug it and power going

---------01:43----------
through it do we have a short circuit we

---------01:51----------
do 10 ohms to ground on backlight output

---------01:53----------
if I unplug the screen cable we get 170

---------01:59----------
thousand ohms which means most likely

---------02:02----------
this is a bad screen cable so let's open

---------02:05----------
this thing up and see if that is the

---------02:07----------
case I got to remove the hinge no biggie

---------02:18----------
you can stick your tweezers in the

---------02:20----------
battery cell to make it less puffy

---------02:22----------
you know what I'll let you do that how

---------02:25----------
about you do that you can do that in

---------02:29----------
your house you go for it and you tell me

---------02:32----------
how that turns out for you

---------02:33----------
okay these two little rubber things over

---------02:36----------
here

---------02:41----------
now remember this has no light in the

---------02:44----------
screen so the first thing I did is check

---------02:45----------
screen power backlight output that's

---------02:49----------
usually on the schematic as ppv out Sol

---------02:53----------
CD bit lid or PP hv something LCD

---------02:56----------
backlight if you go to where the LCD

---------02:58----------
connector is on the schematic there's

---------03:00----------
often going to be something that makes

---------03:03----------
it very obvious that that's backlight so

---------03:05----------
yeah I'll open up the schematic for this

---------03:07----------
one this one's a 37 87 so this is the

---------03:10----------
LCD connector where the screen plugs in

---------03:12----------
and the first pin here ppv out LCD

---------03:17----------
backlight and if I click that it shows

---------03:19----------
me all the places that backlight shows

---------03:20----------
up so here we have a capacitor where we

---------03:22----------
have ground on one side and the LCD

---------03:25----------
backlight output on the other and over

---------03:27----------
here you can see backlight fuse in the

---------03:29----------
backlight circuit I have 7700 that's

---------03:31----------
what I measured before no we are going

---------03:34----------
to do this you know

---------03:39----------
unplug the UCAN antenna now this is a

---------03:44----------
difficult one to pull out this webcam

---------03:46----------
thing because you can't really pull it

---------03:49----------
out with your nail since there's barely

---------03:50----------
any sticking out there to get it out by

---------03:52----------
so how are you gonna remove that

---------03:54----------
connector without breaking it out of the

---------03:56----------
machine see this is a difficult one this

---------03:57----------
is a painful one most people they pull

---------04:00----------
and they rip the cable or the connector

---------04:03----------
because the cable is not strong enough

---------04:04----------
usually to support this and of course

---------04:07----------
because I'm recording it and I'm trying

---------04:08----------
to show you something that's the one

---------04:09----------
[ __ ] time that it comes out easily

---------04:10----------
but it usually doesn't do that so you

---------04:13----------
can use one of these pride tools and do

---------04:14----------
this or if you don't have a pride tool

---------04:16----------
on you I you could use a t5 screwdriver

---------04:18----------
just don't touch the board and if you

---------04:21----------
touch the board a little bit it's not

---------04:22----------
too terrible but you don't want to

---------04:24----------
scrape through layers of it and do this

---------04:25----------
a little out on this side a little out

---------04:28----------
on that side a little out there and then

---------04:29----------
you can pull the cable out yeah there's

---------04:31----------
a lot of people that rip that cable and

---------04:33----------
once you rip that cable you're not

---------04:35----------
getting a web cam ever again cuz you

---------04:36----------
have to run that cable behind the screen

---------04:38----------
which you're gonna have to break in

---------04:40----------
order to get into and it's very very bad

---------04:41----------
it's just done no don't break that cable

---------04:43----------
so what you do is you don't remove the

---------04:45----------
cable and you don't need a spudger you

---------04:46----------
can oh you can use something else it's

---------04:47----------
not the end of the world if you use

---------04:48----------
something else so only the end of the

---------04:50----------
world if you [ __ ] it up using something

---------04:52----------
else

---------04:52----------
all right take out those two little

---------04:54----------
pieces over here no contact tracing

---------05:07----------
going on there and we got to get this

---------05:12----------
stupid clutch cover off which never

---------05:14----------
wants to go back on properly after you

---------05:15----------
remove it piece of [ __ ]

---------05:19----------
come on you [ __ ] there we go I need a

---------05:28----------
smaller Philips I brought home my

---------05:30----------
smaller Philips so that erica could take

---------05:31----------
apart or a keyboard but she hasn't taken

---------05:35----------
apart her keyboard yet this is the Wi-Fi

---------05:40----------
antenna here gotta unscrew this thing so

---------05:45----------
many screws in this little bastard the

---------05:48----------
display cable is taped around that that

---------05:50----------
goes around the antenna this whole thing

---------05:53----------
is a troll by design by design at the

---------05:56----------
total troll

---------06:00----------
and it wouldn't be an apple product if

---------06:02----------
they didn't put a screw underwires

---------06:05----------
total pricks okay Wi-Fi antennas off all

---------06:17----------
right this is gonna look be interesting

---------06:19----------
so this is not gonna be a screen cable

---------06:21----------
necessarily but it's not gonna need a

---------06:22----------
screen either this may actually require

---------06:25----------
a refurbishing of the screen yeah check

---------06:27----------
that up you see what I see now this is

---------06:31----------
on the screen side look at the screen

---------06:42----------
the screen connected on the screen side

---------06:44----------
itself is bad now the thing is I want to

---------06:48----------
try and reuse this screen why do I want

---------06:50----------
to reuse this screen so this screen used

---------06:52----------
to be 85 to 90 dollars now this screen

---------06:54----------
is not available at all all you can buy

---------06:55----------
is the entire top assembly with the

---------06:57----------
Apple logo in the back and the metal

---------06:59----------
container and the and the hinges and

---------07:02----------
everything and that's gonna cost over

---------07:04----------
$400 and even if you could replace the

---------07:07----------
screen at $85 it's a really miserable

---------07:09----------
thing to do replacing the screen on this

---------07:11----------
is not easy at all so I don't want to

---------07:13----------
tell this customer they need a new

---------07:14----------
screen because for some reason their

---------07:15----------
control board died because Apple I what

---------07:18----------
I what I'm gonna try to do here is

---------07:20----------
revive this as is so the first thing I'm

---------07:23----------
gonna try and do is remove that screen

---------07:26----------
connector now I used to have a soldering

---------07:29----------
tip that was gigantic and I'm gonna see

---------07:33----------
if I can find that and steal it because

---------07:35----------
it's gonna allow me to easily remove

---------07:37----------
that without damaging it with hot air

---------07:39----------
the tips that I'm using here is at-15

---------07:43----------
1403 that's t 15

---------07:46----------
14:03 if I use hot air on this to try to

---------07:49----------
get this LCD connector off what's gonna

---------07:52----------
happen is if I heat this I I'm gonna

---------07:55----------
heat the ribbon cable under it but more

---------07:57----------
importantly I'm gonna destroy the screen

---------07:59----------
the screen does not like getting hit

---------08:01----------
with two or three or four hundred

---------08:02----------
Celsius it's not gonna work so this is

---------08:06----------
the tip I'm gonna use oh you're this

---------08:08----------
thing it's gigantic

---------08:10----------
okay so we do this and we take the big

---------08:12----------
tip this is what I like about the hakko

---------08:18----------
iron is that you can get just about any

---------08:19----------
tip for this thing that's what I like

---------08:20----------
about the OL the FX 951 is the

---------08:23----------
availability of all these little things

---------08:25----------
like this it's awesome so now we're

---------08:31----------
going to turn the screen so that it's

---------08:36----------
it's more comfortable for me to work

---------08:38----------
remember you don't want to have

---------08:40----------
stationed yourself around the screens

---------08:43----------
comfort you want to have the device on

---------08:45----------
the desk so that you're comfortable

---------08:47----------
which is actually kind of hard here

---------08:49----------
because I'm right-handed and it would

---------08:52----------
make more sense if I was left-handed so

---------08:54----------
that the screen would not be hitting me

---------08:58----------
okay so watch what we do here we're

---------09:01----------
gonna kind of sweep this connector off

---------09:02----------
of the boy

---------09:14----------
we don't want to touch the screen at all

---------09:24----------
also everybody say hello to the

---------09:26----------
flickering microscope camera like I over

---------09:31----------
vaulted a really cheap microscope light

---------09:32----------
because I'm a cheapskate after buying

---------09:34----------
that polarizer filter I didn't have

---------09:35----------
enough light so I over vaulted it and

---------09:37----------
I'm sending like fourteen or fifteen or

---------09:39----------
sixteen volts through this microscope

---------09:40----------
light and let me tell you it does not

---------09:41----------
like that at all it does not like that

---------09:46----------
at all so it's now it's responding my

---------09:49----------
flickering instead of do the right thing

---------09:51----------
and just pay the hundred something bucks

---------09:53----------
for a good microscope light I'm just

---------09:54----------
gonna continue over vaulting this one

---------09:55----------
and giving myself a seizure but it's

---------09:59----------
kind of fun I like it

---------10:10----------
there we go see the end the connector

---------10:13----------
comes right off without having to use

---------10:14----------
any hot air pretty cool right I got this

---------10:19----------
tip for when I was doing BGA rework so

---------10:22----------
that I could easily wick the entire area

---------10:26----------
underneath the GPU without having to go

---------10:28----------
you know down at 20 different times and

---------10:31----------
it was pretty nice for that but it also

---------10:33----------
comes in handy for these situations and

---------10:35----------
not not just wicking beat large BGA chip

---------10:38----------
pads

---------10:52----------
so let's clean up the area

---------10:58----------
[Music]

---------11:08----------
[Music]

---------11:40----------
all right I got to get myself an LCD

---------11:42----------
connector I'll be right back

---------11:44----------
where could you buy an LCD connector if

---------11:47----------
you wanted an LCD connector

---------11:48----------
I wonder where if you wanted an LCD

---------11:52----------
connector where could you think of where

---------11:54----------
you would be able to find that LCD

---------11:56----------
connector at a reasonable price

---------11:58----------
with same-day shipping that's right

---------12:02----------
folks

---------12:03----------
same-day shipping OMG OMG same-day

---------12:09----------
shipping

---------12:10----------
yes indeed where would you go if you

---------12:13----------
wanted to find that where would you go

---------12:17----------
think about it if you were smart where

---------12:23----------
would you go

---------12:27----------
stored on trosman group calm baby store

---------12:32----------
awesome group calm that's where you go

---------13:40----------
what do you mean from TV monitor I use

---------13:44----------
an HDMI capture card to get the

---------13:46----------
microscope camera as well as my

---------13:47----------
camcorder and the overhead camera yeah I

---------13:51----------
don't know what you mean by TV monitor

---------14:01----------
all right this is hard cuz you got this

---------14:02----------
cable in the way that that's the actual

---------14:04----------
backlight cable itself say bray go away

---------14:13----------
stop bitching there is no reason to keep

---------14:19----------
bitching shoo and listening to music

---------14:24----------
while fixing a board [ __ ] off

---------14:32----------
[Applause]

---------14:39----------
in multiple video sources is a capture

---------14:41----------
card i use this mage well quad hdmi

---------14:48----------
capture card but it's actually not a

---------14:49----------
good deal anymore because black magic

---------14:51----------
came out with one that can do 4k and

---------14:54----------
it's actually cheaper this one can't

---------14:59----------
then again black magic doesn't really

---------15:02----------
work just out of the box the same way

---------15:03----------
that the mage well stuff does as easily

---------16:02----------
I used of a black magic card first it

---------16:06----------
didn't accept my microscope input

---------16:07----------
because they claims that the microscope

---------16:09----------
input my microscope camera was a medical

---------16:12----------
HDMI not broadcast HDMI and this is only

---------16:14----------
compatible with broadcast HDMI which

---------16:17----------
other like the biggest load of [ __ ] I'd

---------16:18----------
ever heard in my life and also would

---------16:23----------
only work if you set the exact frame air

---------16:25----------
to your device so if my camera is

---------16:27----------
outputting 59.94 frames per second and I

---------16:29----------
set it to 60 I'd get black video and

---------16:32----------
it's too much of a pain in the ass

---------16:45----------
leave the hinge screw so Henry if you

---------16:47----------
want to do that leave the hinge screws

---------16:49----------
very loose close it line it up

---------16:51----------
then tighten the hinge screws then open

---------16:53----------
it then you have to disconnect the hinge

---------16:55----------
the display assembly to put the clutch

---------16:58----------
cover on but that's how you make sure

---------16:59----------
that the hinges are on the rights are

---------17:00----------
screw it into just the right spot

---------17:08----------
when did this connector become such a

---------17:10----------
piece of [ __ ] it seems like the I have

---------17:13----------
two different connectors is that this is

---------17:15----------
the motherboards connector and then this

---------17:16----------
display side connector and the display

---------17:18----------
side connector is really annoying to

---------17:21----------
work with by contraries

---------17:30----------
what's the best MacBook to buy for the

---------17:32----------
least amount of problems I need to get

---------17:33----------
one for work

---------17:36----------
no no 2013 9 1502 or a 1466 but ultimate

---------17:43----------
don't buy a MacBook come on

---------18:20----------
the normal drag soldering technique I

---------18:23----------
use doesn't want to work on this

---------18:24----------
connector because the pins are so shitty

---------18:27----------
it'll just break into pieces what

---------18:32----------
[Music]

---------18:41----------
see how easily they Bend here like these

---------18:45----------
pins are made of [ __ ] it's not like the

---------18:49----------
LCD connector that goes to the board

---------18:51----------
that one's very very strong and durable

---------18:53----------
it's really interesting because it's the

---------18:58----------
same general connector the only

---------19:00----------
difference is that other one has those

---------19:01----------
two little pegs under it

---------19:23----------
these pins are such [ __ ] they Bend you

---------19:26----------
so easily this is not like the normal

---------19:31----------
high pecks connected

---------19:36----------
and making matters worse my microscope

---------19:38----------
light is probably giving you all a nice

---------19:40----------
seizure by now

---------19:47----------
[Music]

---------21:25----------
all right

---------21:37----------
make sure the pad is heated in the pen

---------21:39----------
is heated make sure all these have a

---------21:42----------
nice connection

---------21:50----------
I was honestly I've been better off

---------21:51----------
using the motherboard side connector but

---------21:55----------
just bending the pegs off at the bottom

---------21:58----------
myself because the screen side connector

---------22:00----------
is such a piece of [ __ ] by comparison

---------22:02----------
it's unbelievable but you see when I do

---------22:05----------
my normal drag soldering I'm just

---------22:07----------
beating the crap out of that connector

---------22:08----------
and it doesn't care and this is like if

---------22:10----------
I tap it wrong with the micro pencil all

---------22:12----------
the pins get bent

---------22:22----------
hi hi as high highs nickname

---------23:02----------
right and I'm not gonna reuse that

---------23:04----------
screen cable obviously so let's take the

---------23:08----------
screen cable off back so we plug this in

---------23:18----------
and now we see if this actually works

---------23:28----------
don't smoke

---------23:32----------
oh no smoke Apple logo well there you go

---------23:37----------
so there what we did was we refurbished

---------23:39----------
the screen itself rather than replace it

---------23:42----------
so we had a short to ground on our

---------23:44----------
backlight line and after we notice the

---------23:46----------
short to ground the backlight line I

---------23:48----------
unplugged the screen when I unplugged

---------23:50----------
the screen the short went away which

---------23:51----------
meant that the short had to have been

---------23:52----------
inside the screen so when I opened up

---------23:54----------
the screen I saw that where the cable

---------23:57----------
for the screen connects that it was

---------23:59----------
burned replacing the cable would not

---------24:01----------
have done any good because as you were

---------24:03----------
able to see that the entire section was

---------24:06----------
all burned so you needed to separate the

---------24:09----------
connector on the screen now why wouldn't

---------24:11----------
I just replace the screen because that

---------24:13----------
screen that used to be 85 to 95 dollars

---------24:15----------
a takes over an hour to replace and is

---------24:18----------
absolutely miserable but more

---------24:19----------
importantly be that screen now costs

---------24:22----------
over $400 because Apple so there's not

---------24:24----------
much I can do if you look for an LP one

---------24:26----------
v 4w t1 s je one I used to get those for

---------24:29----------
$85 and now they cost over 400 so

---------24:33----------
replacing the screen on this would have

---------24:34----------
been prohibitively expensive now when

---------24:37----------
someone says but Louis I think it's just

---------24:40----------
the cable it's just the cable and I

---------24:43----------
respond with something that kind of

---------24:44----------
crushes their hopes and dreams that this

---------24:46----------
is going to be a five dollar repair

---------24:47----------
hopefully this video serves as evidence

---------24:49----------
as to why opening this display assembly

---------24:51----------
up is honestly easier than it was on

---------24:53----------
older generations where just to get to

---------24:55----------
the screen cable you had to remove a

---------24:56----------
piece of glass that often broke it's

---------24:57----------
easier to get to the screen cable in

---------24:59----------
here than it is on some of Apple's older

---------25:01----------
designs for sure absolutely but

---------25:03----------
replacing the connector and all that

---------25:05----------
stuff that burned when the cable burned

---------25:06----------
and all that it's it's it's not a

---------25:08----------
five-minute thing but as you can see it

---------25:11----------
does work we do get a backlight now and

---------25:14----------
an image and so we didn't have to

---------25:15----------
replace the entire display assembly so

---------25:17----------
while this is not a cheap $5 fix this is

---------25:20----------
definitely less than the 500 to a

---------25:22----------
thousand dollars that a customer would

---------25:24----------
have been charged had they gone to the

---------25:25----------
Genius Bar that's it for today

---------25:27----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------25:29----------
something thank you so much for watching

---------25:30----------
and if you want to buy a connector

---------25:32----------
anything like that

---------25:33----------
well store dot Rossman group comm for

---------25:35----------
life baby see you in the next video
