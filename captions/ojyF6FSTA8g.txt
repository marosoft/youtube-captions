---------00:00----------
I promised you another era no power no a

---------00:01----------
promise is a promise okay eight wait

---------00:04----------
this is no power slash kernel panics is

---------00:07----------
that still counts as a no power how can

---------00:09----------
it kernel panic if there's no power and

---------00:11----------
the kind of crap you trying to okay from

---------00:13----------
me liquid damage flickering screen I

---------00:16----------
could take a look

---------00:26----------
here we have the LED driver chip it

---------00:33----------
looks clean

---------00:34----------
here we have the SMC some pubes but

---------00:37----------
rather clean we have a little green

---------00:39----------
thing over there and that's fine not as

---------00:44----------
green as Jessa's wallet which that's

---------00:48----------
okay someone on reddit still thinks that

---------00:50----------
I Jessa am your grandmother yes it's one

---------00:54----------
of those things about putting rumors on

---------00:55----------
the internet it's really hard to get rid

---------00:57----------
of them once they're out there imagine

---------00:59----------
that

---------01:08----------
imagine that

---------01:14----------
so this board looks normally dirty

---------01:28----------
here we have a jtag connector everybody

---------01:31----------
wave hi to the jtag connector you can

---------01:36----------
get a jtag connector on store dot

---------01:38----------
Rossmann group comm /j tag HTML that's

---------01:42----------
stored out Rossman group comm /j th e

---------01:45----------
dot HTML

---------01:50----------
after leaving and laughing our blonde

---------01:53----------
assistant has come back everybody wave

---------01:56----------
hi to our blonde assistant how very

---------02:03----------
russian of you now over here on the

---------02:05----------
screen over here you'll notice that our

---------02:09----------
DC n board appears to have a little bit

---------02:12----------
of corrosion on it now what you see here

---------02:14----------
is oh yeah you got to stop laughing like

---------02:16----------
a girl yeah laughs like Steve here that

---------02:20----------
hearty laugh that's the laugh of a man

---------02:22----------
that just tricked somebody out of nine

---------02:23----------
hundred bucks for his date no means yes

---------02:35----------
listen to Ilhan Omar anyway so here we

---------02:38----------
have what's called the hall sensor hey

---------02:40----------
hall sensor is going to detect when

---------02:42----------
magnetism is near it and send out a

---------02:43----------
signal Paul that's actually working on

---------02:45----------
fixing the hall sensor here because

---------02:48----------
we're that cheap that we would rather

---------02:49----------
not replace this hall sensor that likely

---------02:51----------
costs five or ten cents we need to save

---------02:55----------
the money we don't have this hall sensor

---------02:58----------
and this is an air yes

---------03:01----------
Oh we're also K so we're also replacing

---------03:03----------
this because that DC n board has now

---------03:05----------
gone up to thirty-two dollars yes also

---------03:09----------
the wholesale cost of this DC n board is

---------03:12----------
net thirty two dollars for want of one

---------03:14----------
connection here we're knocking oh so we

---------03:16----------
are good house so we are going to

---------03:18----------
refurbish this he said I'm going to use

---------03:24----------
a pall amount of flux from a flux top

---------03:27----------
[ __ ] syringe what the hell loxias

---------03:31----------
[ __ ] weekly did okay no hi hi clean the

---------03:33----------
syringe I how you here you you hold that

---------03:37----------
like you're gonna won't use it and you

---------03:38----------
tell me that's clean

---------03:41----------
yeah exactly hi hi good one job hi hi

---------03:47----------
so here we're scraping away at the area

---------03:49----------
with an exacto knife cleaning off the

---------03:51----------
corrosion now I'm in true Lewis rossman

---------03:54----------
fashion I use tweezers you use my

---------03:56----------
tweezers I use tweezers

---------03:57----------
let's see what Paul does when they're

---------04:00----------
not his tweezers Oh

---------04:04----------
you that I have four sets of tweezers

---------04:06----------
there so you might as well I'm using the

---------04:08----------
old ones if you are me would be using

---------04:11----------
the new ones after scraping away the

---------04:13----------
corrosion we clean it off with alcohol

---------04:15----------
and we put a little bit of flux in order

---------04:17----------
to touch up the connection

---------04:24----------
that is not an appropriate amount of

---------04:26----------
flux likely this will not work but this

---------04:30----------
is one of those things where you cannot

---------04:31----------
tell somebody what to do they must learn

---------04:33----------
by that they must learn for themselves

---------04:35----------
after Paul turns this back on and has no

---------04:38----------
backlight we will put the proper 30 CC's

---------04:40----------
of flux as I said before a Hall sensor

---------04:43----------
is going to detect magnetism now the way

---------04:45----------
this what machine works is you have a

---------04:47----------
magnet in the screen and a hall sensor

---------04:50----------
in the palm rest so what's going to

---------04:52----------
happen is when you close the Machine the

---------04:54----------
hall sensor is going to detect that that

---------04:56----------
magnet that's in the screen is really

---------04:58----------
close to it and it's going to tell the

---------04:59----------
Machine that it's closed so turn the

---------05:01----------
screen off and when you open the Machine

---------05:03----------
it's going to tell the Machine the

---------05:04----------
screen is now away from the hall sensor

---------05:06----------
the laptop must be open turn the screen

---------05:08----------
on and if this hall sensor is corroded

---------05:11----------
or broken it's going to think that the

---------05:12----------
machine is closed when it's actually

---------05:13----------
open and that's what's gonna be causing

---------05:15----------
our intermittent video we're gonna

---------05:17----------
scrape away at that corrosion

---------05:18----------
I need a donor board same way that

---------05:20----------
Venera scrapes away at my privacy

---------05:22----------
don't you veneer isn't because there's

---------05:25----------
no difference between one person knowing

---------05:27----------
in 800 3000 perhaps we should let 1800

---------05:31----------
3000 people know what your real hair

---------05:33----------
colors that's what I thought now you're

---------05:38----------
gonna use the Omnibus but you can find

---------05:41----------
an affiliate link down below the omnibus

---------05:44----------
allows you to put the board in the

---------05:46----------
position that you would like it to go

---------05:48----------
and it will stay in place as you can see

---------05:51----------
here as you can see see here as you can

---------05:58----------
see here it allows the board to be held

---------06:00----------
in place for the low low price of 50 to

---------06:02----------
80 dollars

---------06:06----------
beautiful isn't he scrape away the

---------06:10----------
affected areas

---------06:14----------
we also pray to God that since I just

---------06:16----------
announced that there was such a

---------06:17----------
ridiculous price hike on this that hi I

---------06:19----------
made the DCN boards either out of stock

---------06:21----------
for more money on stored Rosman

---------06:23----------
group.com or else I'm gonna be selling

---------06:25----------
over 30 items from inventory at $10

---------06:28----------
below cost which will come directly out

---------06:31----------
of high highs paycheck Theresa says more

---------06:34----------
flux no more flux you maniacs much novel

---------06:42----------
where's the mic my mouse yes I believe

---------06:45----------
this mouse is worse than the monster

---------06:47----------
Yahoo front yeah that's pretty bad

---------06:59----------
do you have a logo the logo of the Apple

---------07:03----------
as you can see we have now refurbished

---------07:06----------
the DCN board a part that used to cost

---------07:08----------
$10 because that's the level of quality

---------07:11----------
and ingenuity that we put into your

---------07:12----------
computer Wow

---------07:17----------
