---------00:00----------
hi hi can you bring the box we have it

---------00:03----------
we have an unboxing video to do today

---------00:04----------
before we get started on our macbook

---------00:06----------
repair hey everybody how's it going

---------00:14----------
today so before the macbook repair

---------00:15----------
begins see if I can clear this desk a

---------00:19----------
little bit the store is too tiny can't

---------00:22----------
fit anything anywhere yeah I can't fit

---------00:27----------
this on my desk cuz it's gonna hit the

---------00:28----------
keyboard and I have no place to put the

---------00:30----------
keyboard I'm so sick of this tiny store

---------00:36----------
box cutter hi hi but I have exacto I'm

---------00:42----------
being dumb

---------00:53----------
I'm not opening this the right way am i

---------00:56----------
I'm a dumbass I thought it slid out of

---------00:58----------
this this is it opens differently than

---------01:01----------
the way I thought it does I can't um do

---------01:05----------
you deserve the plaque if you're too

---------01:06----------
stupid to unbox it

---------01:17----------
you're bigger than Vancouver you're

---------01:20----------
bigger than Venice you're even bigger

---------01:23----------
than Las Vegas 1 million subscribers

---------01:27----------
maybe you've imagined that day for a

---------01:28----------
long time or maybe you never thought

---------01:30----------
you'd grow so big either way not much

---------01:32----------
can match the satisfaction of finding

---------01:34----------
out that your creativity your ideas that

---------01:36----------
your voice speaks to 1 million people

---------01:37----------
across the globe we know that being able

---------01:40----------
to touch lives so many people is reward

---------01:41----------
enough for incredibly proud of all

---------01:43----------
you've done so we hope you'll accept

---------01:44----------
this gold creator award as a token of

---------01:46----------
our esteem with your track record we

---------01:49----------
suspect you're only gonna keep growing

---------01:50----------
and we can't wait to see you reach the

---------01:52----------
next milestone 10 million subscribers

---------01:54----------
it may seem far away but remember the

---------01:56----------
days when you were psyched to have a

---------01:57----------
thousand you've amazed us keep daring

---------01:59----------
keep dreaming big and keep creating

---------02:01----------
you're the inspiration for everything we

---------02:03----------
do sincerely the lady that everybody

---------02:07----------
dislikes at YouTube to the point where

---------02:08----------
when her face is in a video they have to

---------02:10----------
turn off the comments because of all the

---------02:12----------
rage she gets for the fact that she

---------02:14----------
appears to be ruining the business CEO

---------02:16----------
YouTube yeah even the paper that print

---------02:20----------
the song is pretty nice

---------02:21----------
you know if YouTube put as much effort

---------02:23----------
into caring about the people that were

---------02:26----------
on their platform as they did into this

---------02:27----------
piece of paper over here this is nicely

---------02:29----------
textured [ __ ] look at this this is

---------02:33----------
something then let's see if I can get

---------02:37----------
this in the focus here can you can you

---------02:40----------
see this yeah this is some seriously

---------02:44----------
nice paper this is some fancy stuff you

---------02:47----------
could see I got to clean some stuff on

---------02:49----------
my microscope I haven't had any time any

---------02:51----------
time to do anything like that recently

---------02:52----------
but I will have to do that soon this old

---------02:56----------
set up look at this

---------02:58----------
make that paper look at the grain and

---------02:59----------
the stuff this is quality again if you

---------03:02----------
to put the effort that they put into

---------03:04----------
this piece of paper into the actual

---------03:06----------
people that make their platform

---------03:07----------
something worth of them oh my god this

---------03:10----------
would be one amazing platform alright so

---------03:12----------
let's just put this aside see what got

---------03:15----------
here

---------03:21----------
presented to luis Rossman for passing 1

---------03:24----------
million subscribers no flux Arvid

---------03:33----------
so crap I forgot to put on my speakers

---------03:36----------
so I can't hear when that happens pretty

---------03:41----------
cool this thing's heavy

---------03:43----------
this thing's much heavy the 100,000

---------03:45----------
subscriber 1 is really tiny it's kind of

---------03:48----------
it's it's much lighter by comparison

---------03:50----------
this thing is huge

---------03:52----------
hi hi can you bring the 1 million one so

---------03:54----------
we can compare I mean the one hundred

---------03:57----------
thousand one look at this thing it's

---------04:00----------
[ __ ] poor Eli

---------04:16----------
I feel bad for Eli that's what I feel

---------04:19----------
bad about I remember when I had about

---------04:22----------
80,000 subscribers I left a comment on

---------04:25----------
one of his videos three and a half years

---------04:27----------
ago at 80,000 subscribers that said racy

---------04:29----------
to a million when he was at about

---------04:31----------
800,000 or something and it was a joke

---------04:33----------
it was a joke but now it's I can see my

---------04:40----------
face in it look at this

---------04:46----------
shiny

---------04:53----------
it's very mirror-like quality to it

---------05:08----------
they eased it to the window it's not

---------05:11----------
gonna come off without destroying the

---------05:13----------
window so no comparison oh well look at

---------05:16----------
it thank you Jason Barney for the $2

---------05:42----------
all right time to put this somewhere

---------05:48----------
high find some place to hang this thing

---------05:50----------
can you influence any New York City

---------05:52----------
landlords with a gold play button to get

---------05:54----------
a new space you know what I'll email

---------05:57----------
that we have lease negotiations on

---------05:59----------
Monday for the new store so what do we

---------06:02----------
have here

---------06:03----------
this is a MacBook it appears to not be

---------06:07----------
turning on it's the first thing we're

---------06:09----------
gonna do as we always do is unplug the

---------06:11----------
charger not unplug the charger is unplug

---------06:16----------
the battery so that it doesn't influence

---------06:17----------
our reading as to how much power the

---------06:19----------
board by itself is taking so we unplug

---------06:24----------
the battery power and now we're going to

---------06:26----------
continuously unplug the I'm gonna unplug

---------06:30----------
the battery indicator so that thank you

---------06:33----------
very much John for the two dollars I

---------06:35----------
highly appreciate it

---------06:36----------
Greg we did put the kibosh on that new

---------06:39----------
store because the building is in not

---------06:42----------
good condition and the building

---------06:45----------
management are cons and I found a better

---------06:50----------
one right around the corner right around

---------06:54----------
the corner three hundred dollars less

---------06:55----------
three hundred square feet larger in mint

---------06:58----------
[ __ ] condition and nice management

---------07:01----------
nice building staff so we're continuing

---------07:05----------
with that so let's take a look at this

---------07:08----------
now we've unplug the battery and all

---------07:11----------
that we are going to plug in the charger

---------07:13----------
and see how many amps this takes it

---------07:15----------
looks like it takes 50 milliamps at 19

---------07:19----------
volts which means it's turning on it is

---------07:21----------
turning on because I see the fan

---------07:23----------
spinning even though there's rampant

---------07:24----------
corrosion all over it let's see if we

---------07:26----------
get a picture on the screen

---------07:32----------
we have caps lock and we have an Apple

---------07:35----------
logo so this probably needs an

---------07:36----------
ultrasonic and it's good boring - let's

---------07:41----------
grab another one let's see if they can

---------07:45----------
turn on with keyboard let's see this

---------07:48----------
keyboard power button allow it to work

---------08:15----------
interesting now it stuck at five volts

---------08:17----------
again hmm that's interesting five volts

---------08:25----------
20 milliamps

---------08:32----------
all right so let's see what what does

---------08:35----------
the other port do Alan seems to be doing

---------08:41----------
well I spoke to him a few days ago when

---------08:43----------
I found the this new space to break the

---------08:47----------
news to him do you think I could show

---------08:52----------
the new landlord my new my plaque and

---------08:55----------
suggest that they give me free rent in

---------08:57----------
exchange for exposure yes

---------09:16----------
we do we start lease negotiations on

---------09:19----------
Monday on the phone conference call I'm

---------09:21----------
excited I get to figure I get to figure

---------09:25----------
out what the catches I think the only

---------09:26----------
catch so far is that the place has

---------09:28----------
scaffolding around it so decreased

---------09:30----------
visibility

---------09:35----------
well

---------09:38----------
you have made an informed customer base

---------09:41----------
therefore I don't think his ability from

---------09:45----------
the street is the thing that matters

---------09:49----------
yeah as long as I can put my a sign on

---------09:52----------
the street yeah because so people can

---------09:54----------
see it as they walk by yeah finding it

---------09:57----------
when you know what you're looking for

---------09:59----------
that's right we don't

---------10:03----------
usually the people that go in from the

---------10:05----------
street they uh they don't know how much

---------10:08----------
things are they bring something that's

---------10:09----------
irrelevant and there

---------10:11----------
curious about it and it's just

---------10:14----------
yeah please be careful but make the

---------10:16----------
right call yeah a lot of people have

---------10:19----------
said that I should be that I should be

---------10:22----------
less picky and one of the things I think

---------10:24----------
is either a there are multimillionaires

---------10:26----------
or be they're making decisions that they

---------10:29----------
would not make if it was actually their

---------10:30----------
money or perhaps both but if I went with

---------10:34----------
that space on 30th Street absolute

---------10:36----------
minimum I'd be looking at spending an

---------10:38----------
additional 120 thousand over what I

---------10:40----------
would spend on this base because I could

---------10:42----------
this base use some paint sure different

---------10:44----------
light fixtures yeah

---------10:46----------
maybe new floor tiles yeah but it's not

---------10:48----------
mandatory but does it need does this

---------10:51----------
place need twenty to forty thousand

---------10:53----------
dollars of construction know much less

---------10:55----------
140 to 200 thousand the 30th Street

---------10:57----------
would have cost to make it into a viable

---------10:59----------
store instead of blaming the

---------11:03----------
construction workers for the fact that

---------11:04----------
the work is so much perhaps I should be

---------11:07----------
blaming the space for asking for twelve

---------11:09----------
thousand eight hundred thirty three

---------11:10----------
dollars with only three months to free

---------11:13----------
rent on a space that is just not

---------11:17----------
attractive and dilapidated you know I

---------11:21----------
don't want to spend that much money for

---------11:23----------
a space that's not attractive red elapid

---------11:25----------
dated it's not in the cards for me

---------11:27----------
and there was a better one right around

---------11:29----------
the corner I got really tired of hearing

---------11:31----------
so many people say you're not gonna find

---------11:33----------
a better deal it's gonna be hard to find

---------11:34----------
a better deal you're not gonna find a

---------11:36----------
better deal well you know what it may be

---------11:38----------
hard to find a better deal did you know

---------11:40----------
what it may be hard to find a better

---------11:41----------
deal it's it's my money and I'm willing

---------11:45----------
to put the time in to find that better

---------11:46----------
deal you know as I said it took me six

---------11:49----------
months to find this place that I have

---------11:51----------
here and I'm two months into my current

---------11:53----------
search because I started around the end

---------11:54----------
of August and I got more serious about

---------11:58----------
it in the beginning of September so it's

---------12:01----------
been I'm two months in I still have you

---------12:03----------
know with a time budget I gave my stuff

---------12:05----------
I still have quite a bit more time to go

---------12:07----------
so I am not in a hurry I'm not in a rush

---------12:11----------
and I'm not going to act as if I'm in a

---------12:13----------
rush when I have no reason to be I think

---------12:17----------
it's important too

---------12:21----------
take things nice and easy until you find

---------12:24----------
the deal that you want many people say

---------12:26----------
this is what the market is but the

---------12:28----------
market is nothing but what people are

---------12:30----------
willing to pay for things and if

---------12:33----------
everybody's selling a bottle of water

---------12:34----------
for ten dollars and one person walks up

---------12:37----------
and says I'll give you it for seven just

---------12:39----------
because they're just because they're 30%

---------12:42----------
cheaper than everybody else doesn't mean

---------12:44----------
it's a deal

---------12:44----------
and it doesn't mean you should take it

---------12:46----------
because it's the best deal it may be the

---------12:48----------
best deal but it's still a ripoff and

---------12:50----------
until I get to the point where I'm

---------12:53----------
completely dehydrated and about to die I

---------12:55----------
will wait until I can get a bottle of

---------12:57----------
water at a more reasonable price at this

---------13:00----------
point in time I'm don't feel dehydrated

---------13:02----------
I don't feel like it's an absolute need

---------13:05----------
so this board was working and it booted

---------13:08----------
up I saw minor corrosion on it that you

---------13:10----------
could probably see I loved this new

---------13:12----------
camera lens I got up here this thing is

---------13:13----------
effing amazing look at this goes up to

---------13:15----------
135 millimeter so before I even get in

---------13:18----------
the microscope you can get a really good

---------13:19----------
idea what's going on on the board I like

---------13:21----------
that and you can see that we've got some

---------13:24----------
corrosion over here by the backlight

---------13:27----------
circuit which was working because we saw

---------13:28----------
an Apple over here by the 3.3 and 5 volt

---------13:31----------
power circuit which must have worked as

---------13:32----------
it turned on and right over here by the

---------13:34----------
charging circuit please get a build

---------13:36----------
estimate from first contractor on 30th

---------13:38----------
Street in the new space assume the lease

---------13:40----------
negotiations go well from the first

---------13:43----------
contractor on 30th Street oh yeah that

---------13:47----------
guy can suck it no that guy no nope mr.

---------13:51----------
$150,000 to do a room anyway and then

---------13:54----------
there's a little bit over here that

---------13:55----------
you're not gonna be able to see what

---------13:56----------
that camera lens so I'm going to switch

---------13:58----------
over to the microscope cam where it's

---------14:00----------
going to be easier to see I don't think

---------14:02----------
you'd be able to see that level of

---------14:04----------
corrosion and I am gonna have to clean

---------14:07----------
the lenses and everything of this I'm

---------14:08----------
very sorry I've just been busy recently

---------14:10----------
and haven't had time to go over the

---------14:13----------
small things my apologies for that so

---------14:15----------
there's probably a mark that you see

---------14:16----------
inside my microscope camera but I've

---------14:18----------
always prided this channel on having

---------14:20----------
really good microscope imagery and you

---------14:23----------
know good quality and I've kind of lays

---------14:27----------
it out on that today so my apologies but

---------14:29----------
as you can see over here you've got a

---------14:32----------
corroded resistor and you've also got

---------14:33----------
this little a

---------14:34----------
it'll section a blue that's barely

---------14:36----------
noticeable if you're not really

---------14:37----------
experienced because it's not a clump so

---------14:39----------
when you have a clump like this you know

---------14:41----------
that's obvious but this over here is not

---------14:44----------
a clump so it's not obvious and many

---------14:47----------
people ask me why is it that you will

---------14:49----------
put the board through you know soldering

---------14:51----------
processes and reheating before putting

---------14:53----------
it in the cleaner so these are the two

---------14:55----------
chips that are going to communicate with

---------14:57----------
my charger in order to tell the charger

---------14:59----------
I want 20 volts I don't want 5 volts 5

---------15:03----------
volts is not good enough for me I'm not

---------15:06----------
a cellphone I'm not a GoPro thank you

---------15:09----------
very much for the 638 rubs but getting

---------15:12----------
back to this the issue is that it's not

---------15:15----------
putting out 20 volts the charger was

---------15:17----------
putting out 20 volts and then I took the

---------15:18----------
board out and I plugged it back in just

---------15:20----------
to see what was going on with it and it

---------15:21----------
wasn't working I was doing that because

---------15:23----------
I wanted to test the power button on the

---------15:24----------
keyboard

---------15:25----------
to see if there was anything wrong with

---------15:26----------
the keyboard before I got to the board

---------15:28----------
and I wasn't able to do that because it

---------15:30----------
stopped turning on now these two chips

---------15:32----------
over here the cd32 15s are going to be

---------15:34----------
responsible for speaking to the charger

---------15:36----------
as I've said in many pass videos and so

---------15:38----------
that the charger will put out 20 volts

---------15:40----------
rather than 5 volts this is not a GoPro

---------15:42----------
this is not a cell phone this is a

---------15:44----------
MacBook and a MacBook is not gonna work

---------15:46----------
off of 5 volts or 9 volts it works off

---------15:49----------
of 20 volts USBC Chargers can put out

---------15:52----------
numerous I did and it's not the

---------15:54----------
Lexington one and I'm not going to be

---------15:56----------
posting about that space until the lease

---------15:58----------
is signed I'm recording the process but

---------16:01----------
season 2 is behind closed doors so the

---------16:05----------
this entire this board needs 20 volts to

---------16:09----------
turn on and a USBC charger can put out 5

---------16:12----------
volts

---------16:12----------
9 volts or 20 volts and it by default

---------16:16----------
it's gonna put out five and that's

---------16:18----------
enough that I can power this chip just

---------16:20----------
enough to turn on so that it can request

---------16:22----------
20 volts from the charger but it doesn't

---------16:24----------
put out 5 volts it doesn't put out 20

---------16:27----------
volts immediately what if it was a cell

---------16:29----------
phone you know it's safe to put out the

---------16:30----------
lowest possible voltage

---------16:32----------
it's not safe to start by putting out

---------16:33----------
the highest possible voltage so a

---------16:35----------
charger a USBC charger is going to put

---------16:37----------
out the lowest voltage that is set for

---------16:39----------
it thank you very much I appreciate that

---------16:41----------
very much

---------16:42----------
Thank You Adam I'm gonna stop explaining

---------16:43----------
this now because I'm not going to be

---------16:45----------
able to since this beeps every few

---------16:46----------
seconds I'm just

---------16:47----------
to get to reflowing this I've explained

---------16:49----------
this [ __ ] already a million times in

---------16:50----------
past videos so [ __ ] it so thank you very

---------16:52----------
much to add a Mondale for the twenty and

---------16:53----------
I appreciate so we are going to reflow

---------16:57----------
this now the reason that I'm going to

---------16:59----------
reflow this is I don't whether than

---------17:03----------
clean it is if I put it through the

---------17:05----------
cleaner the very small bits of the

---------17:06----------
solder balls under there that I've kind

---------17:09----------
of started to disintegrate are going to

---------17:11----------
fully go away and if it fully goes away

---------17:13----------
then I'm not going to be able to you

---------17:18----------
know do anything this is not I'm not

---------17:20----------
gonna I don't have to replace the chip

---------17:22----------
it's not gonna work whereas if I heat it

---------17:25----------
up prematurely if I heat it up the

---------17:33----------
treatment before I do any sort of

---------17:36----------
cleaning there's a chance that that

---------17:37----------
little disintegrated solder ball may

---------17:39----------
come back to me and that's what I'm

---------17:41----------
looking for here if the chip itself is

---------17:43----------
actually dead then nothing is going to

---------17:46----------
fix it with reflow

---------17:48----------
this is not going to work but if the

---------17:50----------
solder balls under it are starting to

---------17:52----------
disintegrate as a result of the of the

---------17:56----------
corrosion and the electricity then not

---------17:59----------
only is the flux and the hot AR going to

---------18:01----------
clean it it's also going to take those

---------18:03----------
solder balls and bring them back to

---------18:04----------
their prior state of being balls and

---------18:07----------
that's what we want on our board we want

---------18:09----------
some nice big balls

---------18:44----------
can I see the red stuff coming out the

---------18:46----------
top see that that's not blood that's

---------18:49----------
green corroded ship and the flux is

---------18:53----------
cleaning all that out you see how that

---------18:57----------
ship moves once it moves I'm good to go

---------19:01----------
now we're going to wait for it to cool

---------19:03----------
off for a moment and we're going to do

---------19:09----------
the same thing on the corroded sections

---------19:10----------
on the other side on the other side of

---------19:13----------
the board we have some corrosion by our

---------19:16----------
backlight circuit some corrosion by the

---------19:20----------
spi ROM for the cd32 15's and

---------19:23----------
thunderbolt and some corrosion by our

---------19:25----------
five and three volts buck controller so

---------19:31----------
we're going to put a proper amount of

---------19:32----------
flux

---------19:51----------
there's a memory chip right next to that

---------19:53----------
so you know what we're gonna do and take

---------19:55----------
a nice little metal shield and put it

---------19:57----------
over that so we don't burn it

---------21:01----------
yeah that was newbie noobish

---------21:46----------
housecalls pinkeye to remove in LA I

---------21:49----------
haven't moved in Ella's leg yet although

---------21:54----------
the new space that I am looking at

---------21:56----------
actually has a DA compliant bathroom one

---------22:00----------
of the bathrooms has those bars by the

---------22:02----------
toilet that you can use to lift yourself

---------22:03----------
up and lower yourself down onto it I'm

---------22:07----------
telling you I'm really really happy that

---------22:09----------
I ignored every single person that said

---------22:13----------
that

---------22:13----------
thank you very much glad I'm here that

---------22:15----------
I'm really happy that I ignored all the

---------22:17----------
people that said you're being too picky

---------22:19----------
just take a [ __ ] space already cuz if

---------22:21----------
I listen to those people I would be

---------22:24----------
paying more money at Lexington for less

---------22:26----------
square footage and having to go upstairs

---------22:28----------
out of the buildings have that square

---------22:30----------
footage this space that I'm looking at

---------22:31----------
has more square footage than the

---------22:33----------
Lexington location it costs five hundred

---------22:35----------
dollars less than the Lexington location

---------22:36----------
and it's all in one space I don't have

---------22:38----------
to leave the store to go upstairs and go

---------22:40----------
into another door it's not the lappa

---------22:43----------
dated I'm just I'm really happy because

---------22:47----------
if I again if I had listened to any

---------22:48----------
other people that said you're not gonna

---------22:50----------
get a better deal than this this is

---------22:51----------
we're gonna be really hard to do better

---------22:53----------
you should have stopped being picky if I

---------22:55----------
listened to any of those people I had

---------22:56----------
have been behind the eight-ball so you

---------22:58----------
know six figures Thank You Aaron Khan

---------23:01----------
for the ten dollars I highly appreciate

---------23:03----------
that thank you okay so now we got to see

---------23:07----------
if this thing turns on let's see if it

---------23:11----------
turns on as you can see it's now jumping

---------23:16----------
up to twenty volts again and turning on

---------23:17----------
with taking 500 milliamps so this board

---------23:20----------
was actually working but it was working

---------23:23----------
intermittently

---------23:23----------
the customer claims that it did not

---------23:25----------
power on and it was powering on and then

---------23:29----------
I tried to power it on again and it

---------23:30----------
didn't work so the first thing we need

---------23:31----------
to do is figure out what it is that's

---------23:32----------
causing it to not turn on in this case

---------23:34----------
it was stuck at five volts rather than

---------23:36----------
20 volts

---------23:37----------
thank you very much JP I appreciate it I

---------23:40----------
am making good use of that drone so the

---------23:42----------
issue here was that it was not putting

---------23:44----------
out twenty volts the charge was putting

---------23:46----------
out five volts because it was unable to

---------23:47----------
communicate with the CD 3215 the CD

---------23:49----------
32:15 was receiving it's three volts I

---------23:51----------
didn't even bother checking that because

---------23:53----------
the circuitry responsible for creating

---------23:54----------
three volts look fine whereas the

---------23:56----------
circuitry responsible for actually

---------23:58----------
communicating with the USBC charge

---------24:00----------
well it looked like it was in terrible

---------24:01----------
condition when we did the reflow using

---------24:03----------
some authentic and C 5 v 9 v 2 TF flux

---------24:06----------
available on store osman group comm the

---------24:09----------
best store on the effing Internet even

---------24:11----------
if it's running on Magento 1.9 and has a

---------24:14----------
bunch of crappy pictures I pick with my

---------24:16----------
cell phone that store on the Internet is

---------24:18----------
that one I refloat it the way I was able

---------24:21----------
to tell that there was a lot of

---------24:21----------
corrosion under the chip you started to

---------24:23----------
see that red and that brown stuff which

---------24:25----------
is the board's version the component

---------24:28----------
level repairs version of blood and poop

---------24:31----------
coming out from under the chip and when

---------24:34----------
I did that gave it a reflow the balls

---------24:37----------
went back to good condition the other

---------24:40----------
thing that many people ask me is that

---------24:42----------
why is it that I you know reflowing or

---------24:45----------
soldering on the board while it's dirty

---------24:46----------
if I clean it all those solder balls all

---------24:49----------
those connections under there are going

---------24:50----------
to get whisked away I don't want to

---------24:52----------
clean because it's going to be difficult

---------24:55----------
to separate the dirt from the solder the

---------24:58----------
ultrasonic cleaner doesn't care whereas

---------25:00----------
the flux does when I flux and heat the

---------25:02----------
dirt gets destroyed it gets washed away

---------25:04----------
but the solder ball itself is going to

---------25:07----------
come back into a nice strong ball but if

---------25:09----------
I put it in the cleaner the cleaner is

---------25:11----------
indiscriminate it's simply going to wash

---------25:13----------
away everything little bits of solder

---------25:15----------
that corroded washed away dirt washed

---------25:17----------
away it's gonna wash away everything a

---------25:19----------
big common newbie mistake in this field

---------25:21----------
and it happens to me regularly when I

---------25:22----------
get boards outsourced from other

---------25:23----------
facilities is that they all trow sonic

---------25:25----------
them for too long they think I'm gonna

---------25:27----------
get them more clean the better and it's

---------25:29----------
something that you know I do with flux

---------25:30----------
you know I figure the more flux the

---------25:31----------
better which imminently when it comes to

---------25:33----------
flux it's just true when it comes to

---------25:35----------
when it comes to cleaning more cleaning

---------25:37----------
is not more betterer you are going to

---------25:39----------
not just be cleaning the board is that

---------25:41----------
you're gonna be cleaning away everything

---------25:43----------
else as well and I think of it like you

---------25:45----------
know those green screen plugins where

---------25:47----------
you have a green screen behind you and

---------25:49----------
you slide the chroma key thing if you

---------25:52----------
put the slider all the way to the other

---------25:54----------
end it's going to start removing you as

---------25:56----------
well and that that's not what you want

---------25:58----------
so that's it for today and as always I

---------26:00----------
hope you learned something thank you so

---------26:01----------
much everybody for watching thank you so

---------26:03----------
much for subscribing thank you so much

---------26:04----------
for sharing what we do and above all

---------26:06----------
thank you for all those people that

---------26:07----------
showed up in Boston to say thank you

---------26:09----------
shake my hand or something I'm sorry if

---------26:11----------
I didn't have time to

---------26:12----------
to talk with many of you I actually did

---------26:15----------
a livestream from a place right across

---------26:17----------
the street from the Boston State house

---------26:19----------
and I was going to say everybody come

---------26:20----------
here and it didn't work because of

---------26:22----------
Verizon and I had zero to 1 bars of

---------26:25----------
service the entire time I was there even

---------26:26----------
though it's a major metropolitan

---------26:27----------
location because Verizon sucks which is

---------26:30----------
very unfortunate given the amount of

---------26:31----------
money that Verizon costs and the amount

---------26:33----------
of time they've had to build a network

---------26:34----------
and I was hoping to meet with some more

---------26:37----------
you afterwards but I was feeling very

---------26:39----------
sick that day I was feeling sick the day

---------26:41----------
before I went and I was kind of under

---------26:43----------
the weather

---------26:43----------
and I just I just wanted to go right

---------26:45----------
back to the hotel and pass out to be

---------26:47----------
quite honest with you so I'm sorry if I

---------26:48----------
didn't get to but to talk with many of

---------26:51----------
you afterwards but for the people who

---------26:52----------
showed up or took a picture or just

---------26:54----------
wanted to talk thank you very much for

---------26:55----------
being a part of what it is we do and

---------26:57----------
thank you so much to Boston for being so

---------26:59----------
welcoming and the receptive of people

---------27:03----------
who were coming from out of state to

---------27:04----------
testify in your state whether it was the

---------27:06----------
people at the legislature or whether it

---------27:08----------
was just the the citizens of Boston that

---------27:10----------
were said hi oh we know you were happy

---------27:13----------
that you're here to testify let me help

---------27:14----------
you with this that that was awesome of

---------27:16----------
you also this thank you so much and I'll

---------27:18----------
see you in the next one

---------27:25----------

---------27:29----------
that is useless that you find that you

---------27:31----------
don't believe is worth any money I would

---------27:33----------
absolutely love to use them to build

---------27:34----------
Paul's office don't delay send them to

---------27:36----------
