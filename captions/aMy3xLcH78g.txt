---------00:06----------
I'm back and we're gonna fix a MacBook

---------00:10----------
today we have a MacBook that seems to

---------00:13----------
not be turning on let's go over to my

---------00:15----------
desk camera and see if we can fix this

---------00:16----------
MacBook here we have the MacBook I'm

---------00:20----------
gonna plug it in by the way thanks to

---------00:22----------
the kind folks at circa specialists comm

---------00:24----------
who sent me the CSI 3 0 0 5 p link below

---------00:27----------
I can now show you the amount of

---------00:30----------
amperage that the computer is using in

---------00:33----------
the camera view again at the very least

---------00:35----------
as long as I'm using a mac safe one or

---------00:36----------
two so as can be seen here we don't get

---------00:39----------
a green light in the charger and it's

---------00:40----------
taking 90 milli amps so it's not taking

---------00:44----------
an amp or half an amp but it's taking 90

---------00:47----------
ml amps and we're also not getting a

---------00:49----------
green light so we don't get a green

---------00:51----------
light that typically means bad DC and

---------00:53----------
Boyd pp 3 before to underscore g3 Hunt

---------00:55----------
missing or the SMC is off so we're gonna

---------00:57----------
do here on this 8 - 0 - 49 24 is see if

---------01:01----------
the SMC is running the way that I would

---------01:03----------
tell if the SMC is running is quite

---------01:04----------
simple I would check the voltage on our

---------01:06----------
pp bus on PP bus g3 hot on this computer

---------01:10----------
the voltage of the pp bus g3 hot is

---------01:12----------
going to be set by the is l6 259 our is

---------01:16----------
l6 259 which you can see over here is a

---------01:19----------
chip that communicates with our system

---------01:21----------
management controller now we've noticed

---------01:23----------
that when the SMC is properly

---------01:25----------
communicating with our is l6 259 with

---------01:28----------
the data line that the pp bus g3 hot

---------01:31----------
that it creates is 12 point 56 volts and

---------01:33----------
a MacBook Pro and at 12.20 3 volts when

---------01:36----------
the SMC is not communicating with it so

---------01:39----------
let's see what we get on our pp bus and

---------01:41----------
see if we're getting the proper voltage

---------01:43----------
the superior PP bus the greatest MacBook

---------01:47----------
Pro so we do this and we're gonna check

---------01:50----------
our voltage on our pp bus g3 hot and as

---------01:52----------
can be seen here but you get 12 point 27

---------01:55----------
volts a sad voltage hey sad pp bus let's

---------01:58----------
take the board out of the machine and

---------01:59----------
see if the SMC is turning on being asked

---------02:02----------
to turn on covered in liquid or so on

---------02:05----------
and so forth so we're gonna go back to

---------02:06----------
our desk cam over here and remove the

---------02:09----------
board from the computer it says use

---------02:12----------
offer code rossmann for

---------02:13----------
10% off of circuit specialist comm

---------02:15----------
that's not true is it it is really well

---------02:20----------
if that works it does and if it doesn't

---------02:22----------
you can complain a circuit specialist

---------02:24----------
comp well hi hi at Rosberg group comm

---------02:26----------
for programming the Bob before

---------02:27----------
confirming it online all right so we are

---------02:30----------
just gonna get all this stuff out of

---------02:32----------
this little MacBook Pro over here we're

---------02:34----------
gonna unscrew the board Brandon my

---------02:37----------
health is fine what you're seeing is the

---------02:38----------
different lighting in the store when I

---------02:42----------
change lighting you'll notice

---------02:44----------
differences in what I look like

---------02:46----------
also I'm gonna unplug the SSD because

---------02:48----------
when we're soldering and adding heat to

---------02:49----------
the board there's no reason to do that

---------02:51----------
to the SSD if we're able to remove the

---------02:53----------
SSD from the board my new machines

---------02:56----------
there's not really much you can do

---------02:57----------
because they saw to the SSD onto the

---------02:59----------
board even though there's no virtually

---------03:00----------
no benefit to doing so everybody - let's

---------03:03----------
take a moment of silence and thank Apple

---------03:05----------
for soldering the SSD to the board in

---------03:06----------
the newer models even though there's no

---------03:07----------
benefit to doing so now if we take a

---------03:10----------
look at this board using this new $550

---------03:12----------
lens which I sincerely hope provides a

---------03:15----------
good enough image that you can actually

---------03:16----------
see what's going on in the board just

---------03:18----------
change our ISO a little bit one thing

---------03:21----------
you may be able to notice here by the

---------03:22----------
way everybody's thank hi hi a trosman

---------03:24----------
group no don't because I hung that mount

---------03:26----------
not him nevermind for the superior mouse

---------03:29----------
let's give high credit anyway in spirit

---------03:31----------
thank high high at high high at rossmann

---------03:33----------
group comm for hanging the superior

---------03:35----------
mount so that as you can see I can tap

---------03:37----------
on the desk and there's only mild

---------03:38----------
shaking rather than completely

---------03:40----------
ridiculous seasickness when you are

---------03:44----------
using the overhead camera so one thing

---------03:46----------
you may notice is that I can zoom in all

---------03:48----------
the way to 135 millimeters in the

---------03:49----------
overhead camera now now if we take a

---------03:51----------
look at the board when even when making

---------03:54----------
a look at the entire board you can still

---------03:55----------
see that there is this water damage over

---------03:57----------
here and remember the SMC is the piece

---------03:59----------
that is a gonna be responsible for a

---------04:01----------
green light in your charger and B is

---------04:03----------
gonna set PP much d3 hot to 12 point 56

---------04:05----------
volts rather than 12 point 23 volts now

---------04:07----------
we deal with looking thinking about

---------04:09----------
things such as no green line the charger

---------04:11----------
if you take a look at the charge board

---------04:12----------
which is over here jafe 7000 see take a

---------04:15----------
look at this this is where the charge

---------04:16----------
port is gonna plug into the machine J

---------04:19----------
7000 you'll see that there is a line

---------04:21----------
called adapter sense adapter sense is

---------04:23----------
going to go to use 7000 and

---------04:26----------
after you 7,000 that signal is going to

---------04:29----------
go to the SMC via the SIS one wire line

---------04:31----------
the SMC needs to be able to communicate

---------04:34----------
with the charger in order to get a green

---------04:36----------
light know SMC communication no green

---------04:38----------
light SMC covered in blue crap

---------04:40----------
no green light now we have two signs of

---------04:43----------
a bad SMC a PP bunch d3 hot which is

---------04:46----------
controlled by the ISL six two five nine

---------04:48----------
which is coming communicates and gets

---------04:50----------
its voltage information from the SMC is

---------04:52----------
twelve point twenty three volts instead

---------04:54----------
of twelve point fifty six volts which it

---------04:55----------
is when the SMC is off and B there's no

---------04:57----------
green light in the charger which is a

---------04:59----------
which is created when the SMC is able to

---------05:02----------
speak to it so you combine that and then

---------05:05----------
we look at this little SMC and then look

---------05:09----------
at that poor little SMC oh my you poor

---------05:14----------
little SMC what is Kevin done to you by

---------05:20----------
the way if you've noticed the

---------05:21----------
microscopes that you have don't focus in

---------05:23----------
the camera the same way that mine do

---------05:24----------
it's because most companies don't sell

---------05:26----------
the one with the mount that I have is

---------05:28----------
you can see over here this is the mount

---------05:30----------
that I am using see this small mount

---------05:33----------
most of them are selling that really

---------05:34----------
long tube crap I'm gonna be getting

---------05:36----------
microscopes with that mount and I should

---------05:38----------
be able to price-match Amazon because

---------05:40----------
you know Jeff Bezos probably too busy

---------05:43----------
spending spending money on Lauren

---------05:45----------
Sanchez and the like so we are gonna be

---------05:47----------
price matching those I hope within a

---------05:49----------
month within a month we should be having

---------05:51----------
these microscopes with the proper piece

---------05:54----------
so that there's none of that vignetting

---------05:56----------
and the chromatic of whatever thing I

---------05:58----------
can't pronounce it starts with an A

---------05:59----------
aberration abrasion a barrage so it's

---------06:03----------
it's gonna it's gonna look better that's

---------06:05----------
a technical term it's gonna look we're

---------06:06----------
gonna have microscopes to focus just as

---------06:08----------
well as this one does we're gonna be

---------06:10----------
selling them for the same price if not

---------06:11----------
slightly cheaper than the microscopes

---------06:13----------
that flip don't focus well because they

---------06:14----------
save ten dollars by buying the of

---------06:16----------
your mount this the difference in price

---------06:18----------
between this the good one and the one

---------06:20----------
that sucks is about 10 bucks 10 bucks

---------06:26----------
 question and so we're gonna take

---------06:28----------
a look at this SMC over here and Wow

---------06:31----------
that does not look good so the most

---------06:33----------
corroded components are gonna be this

---------06:35----------
thing over here which it looks like it's

---------06:38----------
Sublime's pp3 before to underscore g3

---------06:40----------
hot to our SMC on PB 3 b3 s 5 s MC v DDA

---------06:44----------
that's not good and we also have much

---------06:48----------
corrosion in the surrounding area so

---------06:50----------
let's see what we can do Oh God and we

---------06:52----------
have resistors that are just coming

---------06:53----------
right off the board when you touch them

---------06:54----------
Oh Lord all right so the first thing

---------06:58----------
that we're gonna do here before anything

---------07:00----------
else is I'm gonna try and remove the

---------07:03----------
edge bonding from the SMC and give it a

---------07:04----------
general reflow because most likely we've

---------07:06----------
got some corrosion that's under the SMC

---------07:08----------
at this point and that's going to

---------07:10----------
negatively affect us in a terrible way

---------07:15----------
big nozzle

---------07:29----------
no Sara's here how are you doing this

---------07:33----------
era janitor

---------07:49----------
Rob Brown you took a vacation I'm happy

---------07:51----------
to hear

---------08:06----------
all right

---------08:20----------
now these are gonna come off nice and

---------08:22----------
happy or not we're gonna make it come

---------08:27----------
off nice and happy like so

---------08:34----------
[Music]

---------08:37----------
BAM

---------08:43----------
okay now before I even get started with

---------08:47----------
everything else we're going to give the

---------08:48----------
SMC a happy little reflow using the

---------08:52----------
proper amount of flux

---------09:03----------
yes

---------09:23----------
you have a question for ping Center do

---------09:26----------
you like to join me for dinner along the

---------09:28----------
river

---------09:33----------
oh my fume extractor is far away

---------09:36----------
it's no good

---------09:49----------
now what this is gonna do is it's gonna

---------09:50----------
help Rhys odd or any of the things that

---------09:52----------
are kind of falling off before I get

---------09:54----------
started and really digging into

---------09:57----------
everything

---------10:10----------
here we give it a mild poke now we're

---------10:13----------
gonna remove you move you and you you

---------10:19----------
you notice how I'm adjusting the

---------10:24----------
temperature by moving the hot air

---------10:26----------
further away from the board

---------10:34----------
massara says this still flux left on the

---------10:36----------
tube not enough in the board good eyes a

---------10:41----------
[Music]

---------10:42----------
Sarah have you opened your board repair

---------10:45----------
business in Sweden yet I hope you have

---------10:49----------
I'm rooting for you

---------11:19----------
Paul Daniels is here

---------11:23----------
everybody wave to Paul Daniels

---------11:28----------
he's a programmer

---------11:31----------
[Music]

---------11:37----------
okay that area appears to be cleaned up

---------11:39----------
now beautiful now we're gonna add a

---------11:43----------
little bit of flux try and patch up

---------11:45----------
those probe points make this a happy

---------11:47----------
little SMC again let's see what it is

---------11:51----------
that we have around here so we've got

---------11:59----------
pp3 be through a capacitor for 3.3 volts

---------12:03----------
going to the SMC as a reference voltage

---------12:06----------
for the sensors another capacitor for

---------12:09----------
that yeah all sorts of stuff that's my

---------12:10----------
published short it's a ground over here

---------12:12----------
but now it's not

---------12:17----------
I'm already in

---------12:23----------
whoops just suck something up no schism

---------12:29----------
yeah

---------12:39----------
some of these pads are most likely going

---------12:41----------
to need jumper wires in order for

---------12:42----------
something to attach to it again

---------13:01----------
I agree with Dafty kins your stream was

---------13:03----------
excellent I'm just going to get myself

---------13:05----------
in a 2-0 - 492 for donor board so I'll

---------13:09----------
be right back in just a moment so we're

---------13:13----------
gonna reattach those resistors that are

---------13:14----------
response to me in the capacitors that

---------13:16----------
are going between PP 3 3 s v AV raft for

---------13:19----------
the SMC and ground now the one thing

---------13:22----------
we're gonna have to do here is check out

---------13:23----------
where these little where what points are

---------13:27----------
supposed to be attached to one another

---------13:28----------
so looks like this is all supposed to be

---------13:32----------
one piece

---------13:39----------
[Music]

---------13:48----------
this is a pro point but that's the pro

---------13:50----------
point that's actually going to go to the

---------13:51----------
SMC

---------13:59----------
[Music]

---------14:00----------
yeah

---------14:10----------
No

---------14:12----------
it may have to take off the SMC and want

---------14:14----------
to jump or dig here boo well let's see

---------14:22----------
one way to find out right

---------14:54----------
I read none of your chat ever

---------15:06----------
now I'm kidding I read everything

---------15:07----------
besides Cortes

---------16:19----------
what the hell is that that's not a pad

---------16:21----------
that's a stain

---------16:33----------
my exacto knife is gone okay so we're

---------16:37----------
just gonna use a tweezer instead

---------16:42----------
see what is that point for that's broken

---------16:44----------
down there that is Oh luckily that's not

---------16:51----------
a point it's going to the SMC that's

---------16:53----------
going to hear so I can actually just run

---------16:54----------
a wire there and I'll be fine

---------17:31----------
[Music]

---------17:36----------
is pull of a heart attack when he sees

---------17:37----------
how much flux you use no paul simply

---------17:40----------
learns when he sees how much flux i use

---------17:42----------
what the proper amount to use is takes

---------17:45----------
his cue and then begins using the proper

---------17:47----------
amount of flux people who do not use the

---------17:52----------
right amount of flux will no longer find

---------17:53----------
themselves employed at Rossmann repair

---------17:55----------
and it looks like that resistor flew off

---------17:58----------
the board yay

---------17:59----------
okay donor number two

---------18:04----------
[Music]

---------18:10----------
Paul Daniels is leaving everybody

---------18:12----------
remember pirate Paul Dan is a soft way

---------19:37----------
yeah okay

---------19:43----------
I have a cat my cat's name is blackberry

---------19:47----------
blackberry goes meow meow it's more like

---------19:54----------
she's such a cute little berry

---------20:06----------
[Music]

---------20:19----------
okay

---------20:40----------
all right let's hope that that's

---------20:42----------
something going on under there all right

---------20:47----------
let's see what happens if we plug this

---------20:50----------
in

---------20:58----------
[Music]

---------21:01----------
what do you know 300 milliamps

---------21:06----------
[Music]

---------21:11----------
eighty-four milliamps

---------21:13----------
[Music]

---------21:22----------
our pp bus what point 1 volt PP bus

---------21:29----------
[Music]

---------21:36----------
we did not go down hill did we pp3

---------21:39----------
before to is point eight am i being

---------21:45----------
troll 2 DC n is

---------21:50----------
[Music]

---------21:53----------
believe I am being fold hmm let's see

---------21:59----------
what is our DC end voltage

---------22:01----------
[Music]

---------22:07----------
18 here

---------22:10----------
fifteen here

---------22:13----------
hmm is that in rush resister any good

---------22:19----------
here 39 ohms what are you supposed to be

---------22:25----------
are 70 20 is supposed to be 47 ohms

---------22:37----------
[Music]

---------22:40----------
hi resistance to ground

---------22:43----------
[Music]

---------22:45----------
zero ohms the ground here okay now

---------22:47----------
that's interesting

---------22:49----------
[Music]

---------22:57----------
PP Buster grounders there this new diet

---------23:00----------
mode that'll give us a faster

---------23:01----------
measurement

---------23:17----------
pp 3 before 2 is now short it's a ground

---------23:20----------
where it was not before uh-oh uh-oh

---------23:29----------
[Music]

---------23:33----------
interesting zero short to ground on PP

---------23:37----------
three before - alright well let's put

---------23:43----------
some voltage into the board see what

---------23:45----------
gets hot see if there's anything obvious

---------23:51----------
sigh sigh hi sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh

---------24:05----------
my power supply software is here we're

---------24:08----------
just going to adjust that

---------24:35----------
[Music]

---------25:05----------
whoa

---------25:13----------
check that out ready one two whoa you

---------25:23----------
want to see the board go on fire

---------25:24----------
go on to see a fire

---------25:37----------
I think that's a great no payroll will

---------25:40----------
go down wait so what's your idea what is

---------25:45----------
the idea yeah freshdesk will get

---------25:52----------
answered faster I I'm not Mya proof

---------26:06----------
okay let's see if we

---------26:11----------
right

---------26:13----------
okay looks like we fixed their problem

---------26:19----------
that's interesting because that was not

---------26:21----------
happening in the beginning but that

---------26:23----------
clock chip must have gotten must decide

---------26:25----------
it didn't like me working on this board

---------26:27----------
this is the thing about liquid damage

---------26:29----------
people to understand is that it's a it's

---------26:31----------
an ongoing corrosive process it

---------26:34----------
continues I mean that corrosive it's an

---------26:36----------
ongoing degenerative process and thank

---------26:39----------
you very much def coin I appreciate it

---------26:41----------
very much thank you

---------26:43----------
it continues getting worse so you could

---------26:45----------
have a machine with no backlight sends

---------26:46----------
it in the mail by the time it arrives

---------26:47----------
it's dead

---------27:17----------
how did you put the edited file on my

---------27:20----------
drive what about for the the connector

---------27:27----------
one is that on my drive thank you very

---------27:30----------
much

---------27:32----------
thanks for everything Steve see you

---------27:34----------
later

---------27:34----------
hard drive video tomorrow I'll take that

---------27:37----------
as a yes I'll add that to the end of the

---------27:47----------
next board repair video I do that

---------27:48----------
successful so

---------28:08----------
that's actually a very common spot for

---------28:10----------
this board to get a hole in it because

---------28:13----------
when that short circuits that short

---------28:14----------
circuits hard and you'll see many

---------28:16----------
machines with a 2-0 49:24 a 2-0 - 30 for

---------28:20----------
76 boards where there's an actual hole

---------28:22----------
in it by the pp 3v4 - line going into

---------28:25----------
the clock chip sad but coming but sad

---------28:30----------
but common

---------28:38----------
okay

---------29:01----------
somebody you forgot a $131 super chat

---------29:04----------
did I I don't have this dinging that's

---------29:06----------
why I don't have to set the ding

---------29:08----------
I'm sorry people that is of me

---------29:11----------
let me load this up and see what I

---------29:13----------
missed

---------29:14----------
yeah I don't have I didn't have my

---------29:16----------
amplifier on so I didn't get a little

---------29:17----------
ding noise rehab PB 3 before 2 with fire

---------29:22----------
maybe copass riyadh heii with cattle

---------29:26----------
prod is the one that I'm interested in

---------29:27----------
ok so now at the moment of truth what do

---------29:30----------
we get does this board work do we have a

---------29:34----------
successful border pair video for hi to

---------29:36----------
edit or is how I getting fired oh yeah I

---------29:40----------
need this thing to be at 18 volts not

---------29:42----------
3.2 what power supply's at 3 point 2

---------29:44----------
volts right now right eighteen point

---------29:47----------
five hey we get a green light 3 and if

---------29:54----------
it the answer being taken BP bus where's

---------29:57----------
my PP but this one doesn't have the fans

---------29:59----------
been immediately because Mac Apple 12.50

---------30:04----------
8 volts alright fan spin-spin-spin it's

---------30:11----------
an apple product so it's really

---------30:13----------
interesting about this particular year

---------30:15----------
is that it's a very similar if not

---------30:17----------
identical design to the prior year

---------30:18----------
except for the processor being one step

---------30:20----------
above and it using quad SPI rather than

---------30:23----------
the old type of BIOS but what's

---------30:25----------
interesting here is that the fan is the

---------30:27----------
same heatsink is the same fan but the

---------30:29----------
fan won't spin for an additional 20 to

---------30:30----------
30 Celsius prior to where it was before

---------30:32----------
so even if the heatsink is burning to

---------30:35----------
the touch to the point where oh it hurts

my finger this machine is gonna have the

---------30:39----------
fan just sit there and let the machine

---------30:41----------
CPU burn because Apple think different

---------30:48----------
just gonna torture this thing until that

AV ref SMC our SMC was not working we

---------31:04----------
determined our SMC was not working

---------31:05----------
because a there were two things in

---------31:07----------
common the sub a one is going to be the

---------31:10----------
window greenlight sub a two is going to

---------31:12----------
be PP brush D three hours 12 point 23

---------31:14----------
volts right

---------31:14----------
12 point 56 volts you really should

---------31:16----------
understand what that means on an air

---------31:18----------
eight point five volts means your SMC is

---------31:20----------
working eight point one volts means it

---------31:21----------
doesn't on a pro 12 point 5 volts means

---------31:24----------
your SMC is working 12 point 2 volts

means it doesn't and be it was a blob of
