---------00:00----------
here we're gonna be opening up a Macbook

---------00:01----------
that is not powering on this is in a

---------00:03----------
1502 MacBook so this is an eight to zero

---------00:06----------
49:24 board or as high I would call it a

---------00:09----------
Sony Trinitron you know what this can

---------00:11----------
get an ultrasonic alright so this board

---------00:13----------
is the one that I was working on in the

---------00:14----------
beginning which is taking 50 milliamps

---------00:16----------
so let's go through this board and try

---------00:18----------
to figure out why it's taking 50

---------00:19----------
milliamps and what could be causing this

---------00:21----------
is an 8 - 0 - 49:24 macbook let's start

---------00:24----------
measuring its rails the first thing

---------00:26----------
we're gonna measure is our pp bus twelve

---------00:28----------
point six volts it's a beautiful number

---------00:30----------
to get on your PP bus next up we're

---------00:31----------
gonna measure PP 5 vs 555 es 5 can be

---------00:35----------
found down here 5 volts steady EP 5 es 4

---------00:38----------
PP 5 es 4 appears to be missing and the

---------00:41----------
enable let's see if the enables there if

---------00:43----------
it's jumping if you enable 4 PP 5 es 4

---------00:46----------
is not jumping it's def let's take a

---------00:48----------
look around this board and try and

---------00:49----------
figure out what could be causing such a

---------00:50----------
thing - hacker hmm now if we look by our

---------00:53----------
clock chip later this but as you can see

---------00:55----------
there are marks from where the gross

---------00:57----------
area was so see how this capacitor over

---------00:59----------
here looks nice it has two metal ends

---------01:02----------
pretty right whereas this capacitor over

---------01:05----------
here has a metal end but then the brown

---------01:08----------
part of it kind of is there and there's

---------01:10----------
no metal cap over it anymore so we do

---------01:13----------
that let's flick that little cap off the

---------01:15----------
board and after we flick that cap off of

---------01:18----------
the board so as you can tell as always

---------01:25----------
we pick the boards from the new slots

---------01:27----------
when Paul is not here at random and then

---------01:29----------
we only choose the ones that are the

---------01:30----------
most difficult at the random pile this

---------01:32----------
one was difficult because as you could

---------01:34----------
see it required an ultrasonic cleaning

---------01:35----------
which meant that I had to get out of my

---------01:36----------
chair they require drying it which means

---------01:38----------
waiting which is pain-in-the-ass

---------01:40----------
required touching the purplish goo on it

---------01:43----------
and then I had a flicker capacitor off

---------01:45----------
which meant that I had to bend my

---------01:46----------
tweezers a little bit which means that I

---------01:47----------
now have to walk up to the front and get

---------01:49----------
a new set of tweezers so any of you who

---------01:50----------
say that Paul is the one that gets all

---------01:52----------
the hard jobs just think of all the

---------01:54----------
heavy lifting that was required to fix

---------01:56----------
the void like this a lot of work next up

---------02:01----------
on the list is a liquid damage no power

---------02:03----------
which try and figure out what's wrong

---------02:04----------
with this liquid damage nope

---------02:05----------
err what happened to other new guy he's

---------02:08----------
sitting in the paul seat working on the

---------02:09----------
paul queue he also has paul RGB so has

---------02:14----------
the food seven dollars for all of that

---------02:18----------
was that how long guys or somebody else

---------02:23----------
yes so as you guys have noticed every

---------02:25----------
time you say a word the LED lights

---------02:28----------
change color so as can be seen here

---------02:34----------
there's no green light in the charger

---------02:36----------
the first thing we're gonna do is check

---------02:37----------
that a pepper three before two is there

---------02:39----------
so we have point one volts on pepper

---------02:42----------
three before two now let's see what

---------02:43----------
we're getting on the input we're getting

---------02:45----------
18.6 on input zero on output do keep in

---------02:49----------
mind that every single one of these

---------02:51----------
boards that I work on does get picked at

---------02:53----------
random random random random picked at

---------02:55----------
random so let's try and figure out why

---------02:58----------
it is that this board is missing PP

---------03:00----------
three before - we're not getting a green

---------03:01----------
light so the first thing we have to do

---------03:03----------
is open a schematic for a - zero - zero

---------03:05----------
zero 165 board alright let's check that

---------03:08----------
out so the first thing we need to do is

---------03:10----------
check out the enable line which is gonna

---------03:12----------
be right over here the way this works

---------03:13----------
shdn is the shutdown pin if the voltage

---------03:16----------
is lower than I think two or three volts

---------03:18----------
it's gonna shut the chip down and not

---------03:19----------
work so it has to have the zero ohm

---------03:20----------
resistor R 7080 here in order to send

---------03:22----------
power from the 16 volt input to pin a to

---------03:26----------
the chip let's see what's going on there

---------03:27----------
it appears that that resistor may be

---------03:29----------
missing does your own resistor

---------03:30----------
interesting interesting that the little

---------03:32----------
resistors not they're so strange I can

---------03:34----------
go and put a little with a bodge wire in

---------03:37----------
there which we're gonna do just test to

---------03:39----------
see if this is the only issue with this

---------03:40----------
board because this random board may have

---------03:43----------
the just a random issue of this one

---------03:44----------
random missing resistor random picked at

---------03:47----------
random random random random random

---------03:49----------
picked at random random

---------03:55----------
we're getting a fence fence so that's

---------03:57----------
about that so we were just missing one

---------03:59----------
simple resistor on this board we just

---------04:02----------
you know ran that little jumper wire and

---------04:03----------
it it seems to be completely fixed so

---------04:05----------
just case anybody is still wondering we

---------04:07----------
get some difficult jobs as well I had to

---------04:09----------
open the bottom of the case I had to use

---------04:12----------
the microscope to find that I didn't

---------04:14----------
have a zero ohm resistor on my desk so I

---------04:16----------
had to run the jumper wire I didn't have

---------04:18----------
the micro pencil plugged in so I had to

---------04:20----------
use a normal soldering iron to solder

---------04:22----------
that jumper wire on there so that's it

---------04:24----------
for today and as always I hope you

---------04:26----------
learned something

---------04:35----------
you
