---------00:00----------
hi so today we're gonna be going over a

---------00:01----------
board for somebody who took the class

---------00:03----------
name is Michael he said that it heats up

---------00:05----------
a lot so this is an 8 to 0 31:15 board

---------00:09----------
and let's try to figure out what it is

---------00:11----------
that's heating up to try to get an idea

---------00:12----------
of what's going on with it and see if we

---------00:14----------
can help him out and see if this is

---------00:16----------
something that is savable or something

---------00:18----------
that's hopelessly so the first

---------00:20----------
thing I'm gonna do here is I'm going to

---------00:22----------
plug it into a charger so let me just

---------00:24----------
get a working DC and board which it

---------00:26----------
looks like I don't have he ha ha of

---------00:29----------
course I have it here yeah yeah okay I

---------00:32----------
can't wait to get my office back so

---------00:35----------
today I'm gonna be moving everything

---------00:36----------
back to my office because in two days my

---------00:39----------
staff will be back and they will get to

---------00:42----------
have fun because after all this I am

---------00:46----------
definitely going on a well-needed who am

---------00:49----------
i kidding no vacation for me I'm going

---------00:51----------
on well needed more work alright so

---------00:53----------
let's see so if I plug this thing in

---------00:56----------
what okay get a green light in the

---------00:58----------
charger so the first thing I'm gonna

---------00:59----------
start doing here is I'm gonna measure

---------01:00----------
the voltage rails I want to see what is

---------01:02----------
present what is not present and go from

---------01:05----------
there so the first voltage rail that I'm

---------01:07----------
gonna measure on this machine to see

---------01:08----------
what's going on with it is pp bus g3 hah

---------01:11----------
that's the most important rail and let's

---------01:13----------
see what I get over there so I get one

---------01:15----------
point five six volts also going around

---------01:18----------
to one point seven of course you can't

---------01:19----------
see that because the multimeter is

---------01:21----------
hiding so yeah let's see I get one point

---------01:26----------
yeah like it's going 1.5 1.4 1.6 and

---------01:31----------
that's what happens when the charger is

---------01:33----------
limiting power Oh because of a

---------01:36----------
short-circuit so I just wanted to touch

---------01:38----------
the board I just want to touch the board

---------01:40----------
right now and something burned me now I

---------01:42----------
mean this should kind of give you an

---------01:44----------
idea of what's going on so again I'm

---------01:46----------
before I even go for the detective short

---------01:49----------
circuit I understand that something is

---------01:50----------
shorting at the ground and I understand

---------01:52----------
that what's shorting at the ground maybe

---------01:53----------
the stuff that's on the corner of the

---------01:55----------
board because it just burned my finger

---------01:57----------
when I went to touch the board and move

---------01:58----------
it over so that I could start measuring

---------02:00----------
it so I'm gonna open up a schematic for

---------02:02----------
the a20

---------02:02----------
3115 motherboard this isn't the I reckon

---------02:05----------
when this was a new but this is actually

---------02:07----------
like starting to become a piece of

---------02:09----------
just because it's you know it's

---------02:11----------
Ivy Bridge and the

---------02:12----------
Peter's resolute err has a lower screen

---------02:15----------
resolution than my than my phone you

---------02:18----------
know it's a piece of now so I mean

---------02:20----------
this is a board that it goes to a

---------02:22----------
computer that is again this machine

---------02:25----------
still sells for like 700 bucks and

---------02:27----------
that's the thing with Apple their stuff

---------02:29----------
holds value even after the

---------02:30----------
specifications long make it a piece of

---------02:32----------
crap

---------02:32----------
so PP buys g3 hot is not where it's

---------02:34----------
supposed to be right and the part of the

---------02:35----------
board that burned me is right up here

---------02:38----------
these caps so c-38 97 see 38 96 when we

---------02:45----------
look at these capacitors under the

---------02:47----------
microscope let's just take a look at

---------02:49----------
that area that burned me let's get a

---------02:50----------
good view of it so that I can show you

---------02:52----------
what's going on let's see alright so I

---------02:59----------
think yeah I mean it you should have an

---------03:01----------
idea of what's of what the problem is

---------03:03----------
here because I mean look at that

---------03:04----------
so those capacitors don't really look

---------03:06----------
very nice now this is a classic case of

---------03:09----------
the t29 boost circuit for the

---------03:12----------
Thunderbolt and shorty and DisplayPort

---------03:14----------
and all that good stuff shorting PP buzz

---------03:17----------
g3 hard to ground so let's go back over

---------03:20----------
to the schematic over here so see 38 97

---------03:23----------
I'm miss 4k god I miss 4k alright so

---------03:27----------
this over here these capacitors are

---------03:30----------
burning absolutely burning and remember

---------03:35----------
the t29 boost circuit comes about from

---------03:38----------
the PPV in t29 boost so this comes from

---------03:45----------
pp bus g3 hot see this is pp bus g3 hot

---------03:49----------
is the first rail over here it's the

---------03:50----------
first rail I checked that after you

---------03:52----------
checked the pp 3 before 2 rail I know

---------03:54----------
that the pp 3 before 2 RL is there

---------03:56----------
because my one wire circuit is working

---------03:57----------
so what I'm gonna try to do now is I'm

---------04:00----------
gonna try to get rid of that short to

---------04:01----------
ground and see if removing those

---------04:03----------
capacitors that are burning my fingers

---------04:05----------
through the job

---------04:06----------
so again pp bus g3 hot is being shorted

---------04:09----------
to ground the capacitors that burned me

---------04:11----------
are on the long something that's around

---------04:14----------
this power rail and that power rail is

---------04:15----------
actually PP bus g3 hot soapy Peabody

---------04:17----------
three hot fees the t29 boost regulator

---------04:20----------
and the output of the t29 boost

---------04:22----------
regulator is actually burning my finger

---------04:24----------
so what I'm going to do over here is I'm

---------04:26----------
going to remove

---------04:26----------
those disgusting looking capacitors that

---------04:28----------
just burned me again I'm not gonna

---------04:31----------
really measure anymore I'm not gonna

---------04:33----------
inject power to see if there's a short

---------04:34----------
there because the little mark that it's

---------04:36----------
on my finger right now is proof enough

---------04:37----------
for me that that's the problem

---------04:39----------
and you're gonna see this very often on

---------04:41----------
the on these boards any mainly because

---------04:44----------
they have the they have all this

---------04:46----------
circuitry right on this on the edge and

---------04:48----------
the edge is absolutely no protection

---------04:50----------
from water not a single thing is done

---------04:52----------
here to keep liquid from getting in the

---------04:54----------
machine again these Apple products they

---------04:56----------
are not designed like the IBM ThinkPads

---------04:58----------
they're not designed like the Lenovo

---------05:00----------
ThinkPad they're not designed with any

---------05:02----------
real idea towards longevity or

---------05:03----------
durability they're just designed to look

---------05:05----------
pretty and I have pretty software and

---------05:08----------
have a pretty interface and a be thin

---------05:09----------
but no real the thought goes into what's

---------05:14----------
going ahead like how is this gonna get

---------05:15----------
used in the real world our people are

---------05:18----------
gonna be are they gonna be sitting in

---------05:19----------
coffee shops where people will spill

---------05:21----------
coffee on a table should we make it so

---------05:23----------
that the part that's absorbing it is

---------05:25----------
right next to where the water is most

---------05:26----------
likely going to spill on the side again

---------05:28----------
it's you know are we gonna make this

---------05:31----------
product so that when something is

---------05:33----------
spilled it's resistant a little to it

---------05:35----------
are we gonna make this products that

---------05:36----------
when something is spilled it actively

---------05:37----------
gets shot into the highest voltage part

---------05:40----------
of the Machine and it this is one

---------05:43----------
of the subtle differences between a

---------05:44----------
think pad and a MacBook Andy and a big

---------05:49----------
part of it is just you know this stuff

---------05:52----------
they just there is no thought put any of

---------05:56----------
these things it's all about making it

---------05:58----------
look good it's all about nice interface

---------05:59----------
it's all about like nice looking design

---------06:02----------
but when it actually comes to things

---------06:04----------
like long term durability you are not

---------06:07----------
gonna find that Apple gives a ship and

---------06:09----------
the thing is there's absolutely no

---------06:12----------
reason for them to give a because

---------06:14----------
we have collectively shown them as

---------06:16----------
customers that we will continue to buy

---------06:18----------
their products regardless of the lack of

---------06:20----------
durability regardless of the lack of

---------06:22----------
upgrade ability that again it doesn't

---------06:24----------
matter like people always complain they

---------06:26----------
say the MacBook Air doesn't have user

---------06:28----------
upgradeable RAM and it doesn't use a

---------06:30----------
standard m2 SSD and it doesn't use this

---------06:33----------
in blah blah blah it's okay then stop

---------06:35----------
buying it or the iPod doesn't remove a

---------06:37----------
battery okay then stop buying it like

---------06:39----------
but

---------06:40----------
but you keep buying it like all the same

---------06:41----------
people who complain about all these

---------06:42----------
features they complain about all this

---------06:44----------
 left and right but do you actually

---------06:46----------
have it in you to stop buying the

---------06:47----------
product that has these limitations that

---------06:51----------
you don't like see I think Apple has a

---------06:53----------
lot of great things about their products

---------06:55----------
but there are all the things that I

---------06:56----------
don't like about their product and

---------06:57----------
because I don't like those things about

---------06:59----------
their product I will simply and not buy

---------07:01----------
them but you guys I notice a lot of the

---------07:04----------
people who really complain hardcore

---------07:06----------
about all this you're the same people

---------07:07----------
very often that will actually buy this

---------07:09----------
 and it just doesn't make sense

---------07:11----------
because like again what motivation what

---------07:12----------
are you giving them to not to you know

---------07:15----------
to change you're not giving them any

---------07:16----------
motivation to change so as you can see

---------07:17----------
pipi bus g3 Han has to be back because

---------07:19----------
the fan is spinning since the fan is

---------07:23----------
spinning I know pipi bus g3 hot is back

---------07:24----------
so what I'm gonna do over here under the

---------07:26----------
microscope is I'm gonna replace those

---------07:28----------
 capacitors with new ones so that

---------07:31----------
we have a properly working t29 boost

---------07:33----------
circuit again now also you have to keep

---------07:35----------
in mind that there are times when you're

---------07:36----------
not gonna have a working t29 boost

---------07:38----------
circuit sometimes there are three levels

---------07:40----------
of Thunderbolt failure here the first

---------07:43----------
level of Thunderbolt failure is

---------07:45----------
something really really basic like this

---------07:46----------
where it's really it's just like a few

---------07:49----------
components a few you know a few

---------07:51----------
capacitors are one of you two pieces

---------07:53----------
that's shorted to ground in a very

---------07:54----------
relatively superficial fashion and what

---------07:56----------
I mean by superficial fashion is that

---------07:58----------
there's no hole on the motherboard you

---------08:00----------
know it's not like this thing is is

---------08:02----------
totally destroyed it's not you know you

---------08:05----------
don't you don't notice a lot of issue

---------08:06----------
with it it's not like the board is is

---------08:10----------
really thick the PC board looks good the

---------08:12----------
surrounding components look good it's

---------08:13----------
just a few components that just so

---------08:14----------
happen to have have gotten hurt the

---------08:16----------
second level is when you have a couple

---------08:18----------
of burnt pads here and there and a

---------08:20----------
couple of like really destroyed

---------08:21----------
components around it if that's not great

---------08:24----------
but then you can still fix it the third

---------08:26----------
level of failure is when you'll see that

---------08:29----------
there's holes in the motherboard you

---------08:30----------
actually have holes in the motherboard

---------08:32----------
and at that point what I do is I cut out

---------08:35----------
the t29 boost circuit as if it were a

---------08:38----------
you know an appendix and I've talked

---------08:41----------
about this before when that circuit is

---------08:43----------
really destroyed you actually risk

---------08:45----------
ruining pp bus g3 hot from ever working

---------08:47----------
again by trying to fix it so again in

---------08:51----------
those situations what I do is I just I

---------08:53----------
actually I cut the trace on the boards

---------08:56----------
that leads to anything relating to t29

---------08:58----------
and I cut the traces I cut the so that

---------09:02----------
nothing is going to be traveling there

---------09:03----------
and then I remove all the components

---------09:05----------
after it just as a precaution but this

---------09:09----------
is a case where it's clearly okay to

---------09:11----------
restore Thunderbolt will be just fine

---------09:35----------
man now it makes that capacitor up with

---------09:39----------
the bad ones mofo

---------09:56----------
all right I have a bunch of 8/2 0:31 15

---------10:04----------
boards so no harm no foul here

---------10:11----------
you're just not organized as nicely in

---------10:13----------
this box here as they were when they

---------10:14----------
were in the separate boxes for the

---------10:16----------
different types of boys in my office but

---------10:19----------
I'll find it and of course most of them

---------10:24----------
are actually missing those pieces

---------10:25----------
because that's a very very common thing

---------10:27----------
to go bad since it's very common I use

---------10:30----------
it often here we go fresh donor boards

---------10:37----------
from David let me unpack these he should

---------10:43----------
have those pieces on them geez these

---------10:58----------
boards of all the new just destroyed

---------11:02----------
they have nothing useful on them anymore

---------11:04----------
I couldn't if I sold these boards for

---------11:06----------
five bucks on eBay five bucks I would I

---------11:09----------
would find myself with PayPal claims

---------11:12----------
these boards are not are legitimately

---------11:14----------
not worth five dollars anymore I mean

---------11:17----------
they're just yeah everything is missing

---------11:24----------
it's like we're pillagers at this store

---------11:29----------
okay

---------11:35----------
okay let's get this

---------11:51----------
my soldering as usual his so let's

---------11:54----------
see if we can make that look a little

---------11:55----------
bit better through the magic of an Tek

---------11:58----------
559 and curvy tip so let's get curvy tip

---------12:13----------
here up to a good point that's eight

---------12:16----------
forty degrees there we go

---------12:19----------
look better looking better looking

---------12:25----------
better see what it does

---------12:29----------
good flux good stuff

---------12:38----------
okay that's good now what I want to see

---------12:43----------
here is I'm going to unplug my monitor

---------12:46----------
and I'm gonna hope that it doesn't ruin

---------12:47----------
my recording here or freeze anything on

---------12:49----------
my system and I'm gonna use that plug

---------12:52----------
with this first I got to put a Ram stick

---------12:54----------
in it so let's get a Ram stick here Oh

---------12:58----------
Who am I kidding I have a bin of ddr2

---------13:01----------
here we really are sodomizer is

---------13:03----------
everything is Jesus Christ it's all gone

---------13:10----------
where can I find some ram ah I miss my

---------13:16----------
office I can't wait to go back to my

---------13:18----------
office I'm excited

---------13:20----------
litter like one day that's all we have

---------13:23----------
right here we go

---------13:27----------
Luis is liquid computer so we gonna

---------13:33----------
put a little Ram stick in there and I

---------13:36----------
touched the flux part of the MA

---------13:39----------
disgusting I'm gonna wash that off with

---------13:41----------
soap in a second and wiping it off with

---------13:44----------
alcohol is really not the right way to

---------13:46----------
do this anyway but see we're gonna okay

---------13:52----------
we unplug my monitor and plug you in

---------13:57----------
here and so I know that it turns on

---------14:01----------
let's see if I get this blade port

---------14:02----------
because if I get DisplayPort then both

---------14:04----------
issues are fixed and I'm good so let's

---------14:06----------
pay attention to the screen over here

---------14:07----------
and let's see what happens when it turns

---------14:09----------
on is it come on you're the only monitor

---------14:14----------
attached okay here we go so it turned

---------14:19----------
gray it's a good sign all I'm waiting

---------14:26----------
for now is a question mark folder once I

---------14:29----------
get the question mark folder I'll know

---------14:30----------
that I'm good and that I'm set and that

---------14:33----------
this is ready to go back

---------14:56----------
question mark folder mofo come on come

---------15:01----------
on you I'm so impatient he's impatient -

---------15:08----------
you see that guy jackass and the left

---------15:10----------
monitor over there

---------15:19----------
okay I see a world icon whatever same

---------15:22----------
 that's a picture good enough for me

---------15:24----------
you're good to go

---------15:26----------
alright so let's plug this monitor back

---------15:29----------
in so that we can go over a little bit

---------15:30----------
of what was going on here and also go

---------15:33----------
over what it is you missed so that you

---------15:35----------
won't miss it next time

---------15:44----------
alrighty so remember in class when we

---------15:47----------
were doing that whole thing with finding

---------15:49----------
a short to ground so and remember when

---------15:51----------
we were checking the panel rails so the

---------15:52----------
first thing that you would do here on

---------15:54----------
this on this schematic here is you're

---------15:56----------
gonna check for power rails come on

---------15:58----------
wireless piece-of-crap keyboard there we

---------16:00----------
go

---------16:01----------
kay 3:30 with new batteries you are

---------16:04----------
literally like two feet away from the

---------16:06----------
computer and sometimes you don't work

---------16:07----------
love it

---------16:08----------
obviously we go to the power rails page

---------16:10----------
you know this lists every power in the

---------16:11----------
computer so you should plug it in and

---------16:13----------
see what it is that's missing so over

---------16:15----------
here PP buz g3 hot was the one that was

---------16:17----------
missing now if you want to find where PP

---------16:19----------
but g3 hot is in the computer you can go

---------16:22----------
over to the board view software type N

---------16:24----------
and then type in the name of the power

---------16:25----------
rail PP bus underscore g3 hot and then

---------16:28----------
it's gonna show you everywhere on the

---------16:29----------
board that that power drill shows up so

---------16:31----------
you can measure anywhere and my favorite

---------16:33----------
place to measure for it is on the big

---------16:34----------
white fuse right next to the RAM slot

---------16:36----------
which is F 70/40

---------16:38----------
now what I did at that point is I just

---------16:41----------
had a multimeter in voltage mode which

---------16:43----------
meant that I take the I can't wait to go

---------16:47----------
back to my office this

---------16:50----------
alright so I take the black probe over

---------16:52----------
here and I put it on ground on this

---------16:53----------
board ground is going to be a screw hole

---------16:56----------
so any one of these things on the side

---------16:57----------
and then I take the red probe and I put

---------16:59----------
it over there and then I read the value

---------17:01----------
that I get now the value that I get is

---------17:03----------
supposed to be twelve point six so again

---------17:04----------
if we go back to the schematic over here

---------17:07----------
you'll see it says voltage well twelve

---------17:08----------
point eight so most of the time at

---------17:10----------
twelve point six and that's really

---------17:11----------
realistically what you're gonna see on

---------17:13----------
your multimeter so it says twelve point

---------17:14----------
eight and what I got was one point five

---------17:16----------
now at that point one of the first

---------17:18----------
things that you want to get you're gonna

---------17:19----------
want to do is unplug power from the

---------17:21----------
board take your multimeter and put it

---------17:23----------
into either

---------17:24----------
Omo diode mode resistance mode whatever

---------17:26----------
it is you have I take usually read probe

---------17:28----------
on ground and black probe on here if

---------17:32----------
you're doing resistance

---------17:33----------
measurements it doesn't matter if you're

---------17:34----------
doing dial more measurements it's best

---------17:36----------
to keep the red probe on ground for the

---------17:37----------
specific measurement so I take that and

---------17:39----------
put it on ground and I take the other

---------17:41----------
probe and I put it on where the power

---------17:44----------
rail is and what I'm doing here is I'm

---------17:46----------
trying to measure the resistance to

---------17:48----------
ground now if the resistance to ground

---------17:49----------
is really really low that means that

---------17:52----------
there's a component somewhere along this

---------17:53----------
board that's sending all of its power to

---------17:55----------
ground so right now I have you know 15

---------17:57----------
million ohms and Counting which is you

---------18:01----------
know not a short to ground now before

---------18:03----------
again I didn't actually measure using

---------18:04----------
the multimeter to see if I had a short

---------18:06----------
to ground I knew that I had a short to

---------18:08----------
ground because something was getting

---------18:09----------
really really hot now the way this works

---------18:11----------
is if any one of the components on this

---------18:13----------
line is shorted to ground all the power

---------18:15----------
is gonna go to ground instead of going

---------18:17----------
on another part of the computer so if we

---------18:19----------
go over to f7 T for T over here here we

---------18:22----------
go so this is where I was this is where

---------18:24----------
I was measuring right here come on you

---------18:27----------
there we go so let's say this capacitor

---------18:29----------
over here see this it's going to ground

---------18:31----------
now let's say it's short it's a ground

---------18:33----------
let's say this capacitors become a wire

---------18:34----------
instead of only passing the AC component

---------18:36----------
to ground it's gonna be passing

---------18:38----------
everything to ground and if this

---------18:40----------
capacitor is passing everything the

---------18:41----------
ground what's going to happen is that

---------18:43----------
all this power here is gonna be going to

---------18:45----------
ground through this component instead of

---------18:47----------
going to wherever it's supposed to now

---------18:50----------
this capacitor over here it's not meant

---------18:51----------
to pass a lot of power it's meant to

---------18:54----------
pass the tiny tiny little bits of AC

---------18:56----------
that may be present there it's not meant

---------18:58----------
to actually pass the entire signal to

---------19:00----------
ground so what happens when you put a

---------19:02----------
lot more power through something than

---------19:03----------
you're supposed to so let's say you take

---------19:05----------
a little speaker and you hook it up to a

---------19:06----------
500 watt amplifier like a tiny little

---------19:08----------
speaker like these PC speakers let's say

---------19:10----------
hook them up to the power sound amp in

---------19:11----------
my office and I turn them all the way up

---------19:13----------
the voice coil inside the speaker is

---------19:15----------
gonna get really hot because it's not

---------19:16----------
meant for that level of power and then

---------19:18----------
it's gonna melt or explode and the same

---------19:20----------
thing is true over here that little

---------19:22----------
capacitor is gonna get really really hot

---------19:24----------
it's because it's not meant to have that

---------19:26----------
much energy going through it it's going

---------19:28----------
to burn so it's gonna be really hot and

---------19:30----------
you're gonna feel that and then when you

---------19:32----------
feel that you're gonna want to remove

---------19:33----------
the components that get really hot now

---------19:35----------
sometimes they don't get really hot

---------19:36----------
sometimes when there's a short to ground

---------19:38----------
the power rail will actually not work at

---------19:40----------
all in this case what happens is the

---------19:42----------
protection circuitry limits the charger

---------19:45----------
to one point seven volts in your case

---------19:46----------
was one point

---------19:47----------
five for some strange reason usually

---------19:48----------
it's one point seven and it's it's gonna

---------19:50----------
limit the power so you actually didn't

---------19:52----------
even have to inject voltage to find out

---------19:54----------
what the hot component was if you

---------19:56----------
haven't short to ground and you notice

---------19:58----------
that nothing is getting hot with the

---------19:59----------
charger plugged in as will happen in

---------20:00----------
most cases you'll take a bench power

---------20:02----------
supply and what you want to do is you

---------20:03----------
want to inject one volt into that line

---------20:05----------
so when I say in Jeff one volt what I

---------20:07----------
mean is you take the ground of the power

---------20:09----------
supply and you'll solder it to a screw

---------20:12----------
hole or a ground terminal on the

---------20:13----------
motherboard and then you'll take the

---------20:15----------
positive terminal of your power supply

---------20:17----------
and you'll put it on the panel rail

---------20:19----------
that's missing now I like to start at

---------20:20----------
one volt the reason I like to start at

---------20:22----------
one volt what if the FET for CPU

---------20:24----------
circuitry is what's shorted and and that

---------20:27----------
that short is going to the CPU so if I

---------20:29----------
say this is a 12 volt power line let me

---------20:31----------
just put 12 volts in there and the

---------20:32----------
component that shorted is a component

---------20:34----------
that's supposed to make pulses for the

---------20:35----------
CPU I'm gonna send 12 volts directly to

---------20:38----------
my CPU and I'm going to kill it or if

---------20:40----------
the FET for the GPU is bad I'm gonna

---------20:42----------
send 12 volts to my GPU and I'm gonna

---------20:43----------
kill it you know what I mean

---------20:44----------
so I like to start this at 1 volt and

---------20:46----------
then slowly raise it up based on whether

---------20:48----------
or not I am NOT able to find with the

---------20:50----------
shortest again I don't bother with

---------20:51----------
current limiting make sure the power

---------20:53----------
supply is set to deliver the maximum

---------20:54----------
amount of current possible always have

---------20:56----------
the power supply set or like turn to

---------20:58----------
current all the way up but you're gonna

---------20:59----------
limit the current by limiting the

---------21:01----------
voltage so you want the current turned

---------21:03----------
all the way up on your bench power

---------21:04----------
supply no current limiting but start out

---------21:06----------
at like point 5 volts and then see if it

---------21:08----------
something gets hot then go to 0.6 volts

---------21:10----------
0.7 volts 0.8 volts and you'll

---------21:11----------
eventually find something like a top so

---------21:13----------
again if you didn't burn yourself on the

---------21:15----------
board like I just did what you could do

---------21:16----------
is you could touch this power supply to

---------21:18----------
the board in the manner in which I

---------21:19----------
showed you the ground going to the screw

---------21:21----------
hole the positive terminal going on the

---------21:24----------
powers rail that's shorted and then go

---------21:26----------
over the board and see what gets hot and

---------21:27----------
slowly raise the voltage based on what

---------21:29----------
it is you see that's going on and that's

---------21:32----------
pretty much what you're gonna do and you

---------21:34----------
would have found out that those

---------21:35----------
capacitors we're boiling hot you take

---------21:37----------
them off and you replace them with other

---------21:39----------
ones you make sure everything works

---------21:40----------
afterwards you make sure the short is

---------21:42----------
gone and you're good to go so that's

---------21:44----------
pretty much that

---------21:44----------
and I hope you learned something
