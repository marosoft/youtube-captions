---------01:08----------
thank you for letting me know

---------01:22----------
where I put that rule

---------01:30----------
yeah and sound should be up now I think

---------01:34----------
everybody complaining it's just delayed

---------01:38----------
fix yes oh good okay it seems we had a

---------01:41----------
20 second delay between what I do here

---------01:45----------
and what shows up on chat it's hard work

---------01:51----------
for the computers doing the flat earth

---------01:52----------
conversion okay morning from the states

---------01:59----------
what times that they're in the states on

---------02:00----------
the eastern side I presume because I can

---------02:02----------
imagine the western side must still be

---------02:03----------
quite asleep that's it she knows of

---------02:11----------
course naturally I'll admit she knows

---------02:14----------
okay do a flip not happening

---------02:18----------
this whole freaking Daniel 6:30 in the

---------02:22----------
morning let's see what was that $100

---------02:25----------
thing $600 USD

---------02:28----------
mm-hmm oh shoot Lewis is here Louis go

---------02:33----------
back to sleep all right let's switch

---------02:37----------
over to something more interesting

---------02:39----------
that's a hit anyway that's better okay

---------02:42----------
we have got this MacBook bored with a

---------02:45----------
great big hole in it we're not gonna fix

---------02:47----------
that instead we're gonna fix this one

---------02:50----------
which blew its SMC and laid behold I

---------02:54----------
didn't have any 34:37 SMC's finally I've

---------02:59----------
got them here so we're just gonna do the

---------03:02----------
thing that Louis loves to hate doing and

---------03:04----------
that is SMC's our suits here he's gonna

---------03:14----------
badmouth flex board view this in now I'm

---------03:17----------
sure Louis will do it lunchtime and

---------03:19----------
Amsterdam that's good Wow look at that

---------03:22----------
you automatic scene switch kick scene

---------03:25----------
imagine of Lewis had such technology

---------03:31----------
all right so we're just taking this smc

---------03:34----------
off the board we'll reball it and put it

---------03:37----------
down on the new one

---------03:43----------
hey Jeff bodean whereabouts in

---------03:45----------
Queensland

---------04:07----------
well let's really that's some seriously

---------04:10----------
weak sauce coming out of it

---------04:17----------
audio is definitely fixed if you still

---------04:19----------
can't hear it then try alt f4 oh that's

---------04:25----------
so immature Paul so immature nobody does

---------04:30----------
the altar for Jake anymore now unlike

---------04:40----------
Lewis I do not have an amazing

---------04:42----------
multitasking multi I multi vision

---------04:46----------
capability so if you are chatting in

---------04:48----------
chat and I'm not responding then what

---------04:54----------
can I say tough luck

---------05:01----------
come on off to get right

---------05:10----------
what is f to be pairing off what do you

---------05:15----------
what are you talking about in front of

---------05:19----------
my face

---------05:27----------
what is FTB

---------05:36----------
how come you're only streaming on this

---------05:38----------
YouTube channel I don't know ask Lewis

---------05:40----------
and he set up the restreamer and now I

---------05:51----------
don't know about others but I find that

---------05:53----------
with these s MCS I got a bit of a

---------05:56----------
tendency to popcorn occasionally so I'm

---------05:58----------
guessing that my technique is not good

---------06:00----------
enough and I'm just cooking the poor

---------06:03----------
bastard things

---------06:22----------
then I get a lot of them that a pop

---------06:24----------
Corning maybe one out of ten but it's

---------06:27----------
enough to be a nuisance

---------06:53----------
they say her Dodge Caliber its nozzle

---------06:59----------
doesn't then I don't like bendy nozzles

---------07:02----------
I have bought a Bandhan Ozzy bendin Ozzy

---------07:07----------
what the hell that's what we're gonna

---------07:10----------
call him now bending bending Ozzy's I've

---------07:13----------
tried a bending bent nozzle I do not

---------07:17----------
like and I find that the I find that the

---------07:23----------
air cools down too much going around the

---------07:27----------
corner and so you end up having to put

---------07:34----------
your hot air up at a much higher

---------07:35----------
temperature just to compensate

---------07:56----------
right now one of these is usually a

---------07:58----------
pretty good fit not you not you I bet

---------08:05----------
you there we go

---------08:07----------
a little fit I'm at the house I don't

---------08:13----------
even know where are my dollies

---------08:23----------
just trying to get the that silicon

---------08:28----------
stuff off there as I find it interferes

---------08:32----------
for things

---------08:37----------
why is dusty gonna make Louis's Lois

---------08:46----------
what are you doing watching streams

---------08:47----------
anyway you should be enjoying a holiday

---------08:49----------
not panicking about what horrors the

---------08:53----------
Flat Earth Australian is gonna do it's

---------08:56----------
not like I'm gonna bring a kangaroo in

---------08:58----------
here and start having a bit of a bit

---------09:00----------
though with it

---------09:08----------
they're bending Ozzie does sound like a

---------09:10----------
proper Australian term as perhaps a

---------09:15----------
tribute to mosquitos or something Oh

---------09:19----------
Sonia is in here hello Sonia hey Big D H

---------09:29----------
and zero effectors in here too I'm sort

---------09:32----------
of catching up a little bit on the chat

---------09:33----------
I had it when this happens

---------09:43----------
okay

---------09:51----------
yes Paul Daniels and his F and software

---------09:54----------
mate

---------09:57----------
let's get the fume extractor going

---------10:02----------
that's it

---------10:12----------
does the job nicely

---------10:39----------
doesn't seem to want to be taking to

---------10:41----------
that one pad so we'll just we'll just

---------10:47----------
coerce it to take onto that pad slightly

---------10:50----------
one loud fume extractor I don't think

---------10:53----------
the fume extractor is England what

---------10:55----------
Lewises might be but I just don't have

---------10:58----------
any audio filters

---------11:06----------
if you're lucky I'll turn on the

---------11:08----------
ultrasonic later and you can all revel

---------11:11----------
in that sort of delicious noise

---------11:30----------
we for those wondering what we're

---------11:32----------
working on we have a eight to zero 34 37

---------11:36----------
and I've just ran out of my wick this is

---------11:39----------
the last of my wick fortunately the rest

---------11:42----------
should arrive tomorrow

---------11:43----------
I actually repaired this 34 37 last week

---------11:49----------
but I need a replacement SMC and I

---------11:55----------
really hope that I don't mess this one

---------11:57----------
up I'm trying to find my soft closing

---------12:03----------
tweezers and I have found them

---------12:10----------
okay

---------12:17----------
their beloved how to wicking

---------12:32----------
well that flux isn't sticking around

---------12:42----------
yeah

---------12:43----------
[Applause]

---------12:45----------
Thank You Sonia

---------12:49----------
he's talking about the Brisbane Broncos

---------12:50----------
what is this a football Channel

---------13:00----------
and I see we have the old game Steve

---------13:06----------
he knows the original Paul Daniels

---------13:08----------
magician using some of his by lines

---------13:15----------
reason why I cleaned this out is because

---------13:17----------
what often can happen when I'm reball in

---------13:19----------
these SM C's is the flux actually gets

---------13:25----------
down in here and then it starts to boil

---------13:27----------
up creeps under the stencil and then

---------13:29----------
ruins the job I mean it's already bad

---------13:32----------
enough that there's flux on the back of

---------13:35----------
that

---------13:37----------
[Applause]

---------13:48----------
I am gonna have to fix that power

---------13:53----------
the name fix this pan up

---------13:56----------
it will just simply rejectable

---------14:07----------
that should do it

---------14:09----------
[Applause]

---------14:15----------
you know there's some see stencil IQs

---------14:29----------
gonna find my sims a stencil

---------14:44----------
blow that out a bit

---------14:52----------
try not bare my fingers

---------15:09----------
this has to be one annoying

---------15:13----------
he's a crud in the

---------15:31----------
okay

---------15:39----------
I'm gonna be doing things a little

---------15:42----------
differently from usual most of you'll

---------15:44----------
probably be aware that in the past I

---------15:46----------
would use dry paste and I would use what

---------15:52----------
would I use a bit of a spudger for it

---------15:55----------
but I don't have any in my proper paste

---------16:00----------
and I'm just trying out new things which

---------16:04----------
means it's probably going to end in

---------16:06----------
failure

---------16:13----------
and some of that delicious toothpaste

---------16:15----------
off

---------16:25----------
the reason why I suspect this isn't

---------16:27----------
going to quite look at how one is

---------16:28----------
because I need too much area to spread

---------16:32----------
out on this yeah this is gonna be a

---------16:35----------
dodgy job dodgy brothers are gonna love

---------16:39----------
this one

---------17:14----------
I get another piece of towel

---------17:24----------
that's not gonna work

---------17:44----------
well I don't know how that's gonna work

---------17:46----------
out let's give it a shot

---------17:48----------
I mean what's the worst that's gonna

---------17:50----------
happen I'll just end up being not Lois

---------17:59----------
it's kind of

---------18:02----------
a bit of a slow cook off get that flux

---------18:05----------
out of the

---------18:32----------
now it's getting close

---------18:43----------
now I have to

---------18:47----------
[Applause]

---------18:51----------
whether we go loose messed up an SMC for

---------18:59----------
an avid hit

---------19:07----------
let's put the straight back into the

---------19:16----------
guess I'll be drying the paste out in

---------19:21----------
this

---------19:43----------
yeah it doesn't look good that's that's

---------19:45----------
one way to call it

---------19:52----------
completely not a butch job I need to go

---------19:54----------
ever done at SMC as bad as this I really

---------19:57----------
must be channeling Louis tonight

---------20:10----------
it must be here in spirit with me

---------20:24----------
good enough

---------20:29----------
well in the normal circumstances I don't

---------20:31----------
sort of run into this issue I'm sure

---------20:35----------
plenty of you've seen the other videos

---------20:38----------
I've done the Lewis talking

---------21:04----------
it's not my normal paste as I said this

---------21:07----------
one has a much finer grain which is

---------21:11----------
actually much better but it's almost too

---------21:15----------
good for me I'll just try again and

---------21:18----------
hopefully you'll do it right this time

---------21:30----------
no I don't do the captain tape holding

---------21:33----------
the stencil down thing pretty much never

---------21:35----------
do that I'll go back to using the

---------21:39----------
previous technique that with this post

---------21:47----------
putting down captain tape to me is just

---------21:49----------
a big fat waste of time I mean yeah if

---------21:54----------
people want to do it that's great that's

---------21:55----------
a choice but personally I've never found

---------21:58----------
it to be all that useful

---------22:11----------
since scrub this huh

---------22:19----------
you're gonna realize that nine times out

---------22:22----------
of ten the SMC process that I just went

---------22:26----------
through works perfectly fine and nine

---------22:30----------
times out of ten the captain tape

---------22:33----------
process ends up being more drama than

---------22:38----------
it's worth

---------22:42----------
for me

---------22:45----------
you know Ezreal is everything comes down

---------22:47----------
to well a lot of it comes down to the

---------22:50----------
personal preferences

---------22:53----------
yeah people want to use captain take go

---------22:55----------
ahead use your captain T if you're

---------22:57----------
comfortable with it that's great but I

---------23:00----------
prefer not to I am found it to be

---------23:04----------
advantageous did I have a mistake here

---------23:09----------
absolutely I've got you sold a post new

---------23:17----------
applicator so two different things

---------23:25----------
now we're ready to go again and just do

---------23:31----------
a different look

---------23:33----------
that's good back Macbook to buy for my

---------23:36----------
first one ever 1502 1466 depends what

---------23:42----------
you want

---------25:30----------
this pace definitely is very good for I

---------25:35----------
find parts very fine pitch stuff but I

---------25:40----------
think I might have to go back to the

---------25:42----------
course grade well yeah

---------25:45----------
gee whiz this is

---------26:07----------
this is gonna be very slow painful perso

---------26:10----------
sorry everybody

---------26:20----------
there is just a huge amount of flux in

---------26:22----------
that

---------26:29----------
thank you juxtapose for putting that up

---------26:35----------
now this is going to be slow and painful

---------26:38----------
that's yeah just very wet paste

---------26:48----------
so I figure we should be here for the

---------26:49----------
next I don't know 15 minutes that should

---------26:52----------
do it

---------26:56----------
so the trouble is what's happening right

---------26:58----------
now is that place is wicking between

---------27:19----------
but a bloody disaster oops I swore

---------27:22----------
that's it

---------27:23----------
demonetized

---------27:40----------
is this even working

---------27:54----------
you know a rumble is gonna have to be

---------27:56----------
redone if nothing else

---------28:33----------
now this is I'm redoing this and now it

---------28:38----------
hasn't even done but I think I'll save

---------28:40----------
myself the drama see it's already and

---------28:45----------
I'm gonna use the pace that I normally

---------28:48----------
do scrape it out of the bowl maybe see

---------28:51----------
if I can find something some good bits

---------28:54----------
of it I need one working chunk of it

---------29:05----------
but it's fairly typical you do this on a

---------29:09----------
daily basis and you get to do it on the

---------29:11----------
stream and it just goes all wrong

---------29:39----------
more flux

---------29:47----------
Matthew yeah well are a lot of things in

---------29:51----------
the Bible

---------30:02----------
I know you guys can't see much on stream

---------30:06----------
this is the more the boredom stream

---------30:15----------
a travesty doom well this cattle

---------30:18----------
thoughts are a very real issue

---------30:29----------
so if you can all just have one steak

---------30:32----------
less a week save the world

---------30:58----------
yes pencils cleaned up

---------31:06----------
you see the flux on that

---------31:09----------
needs to come off

---------32:04----------
now Lewis I'm redoing it because I was

---------32:08----------
foolish and decide to let me do

---------32:11----------
something on stream when I've got a

---------32:13----------
whole new bunch of variables involved

---------32:16----------
compared to my normal routine

---------32:23----------
but you know that's that's the right way

---------32:25----------
to do this don't show everybody what

---------32:29----------
you'd normally do every day with no

---------32:31----------
trouble no no no no no that's not

---------32:33----------
acceptable you got to go crazy and

---------32:37----------
change it up

---------32:45----------
let's see if I can find some squishy

---------32:48----------
paste in here

---------32:53----------
and so that's that's more what you're

---------32:55----------
looking for something even that's a bit

---------32:57----------
wet so we'll try and bring the content

---------33:03----------
down on that

---------33:21----------
[Applause]

---------33:28----------
Hey look some sort of drug addict here

---------33:31----------
and this is me just you know preparing

---------33:33----------
my hit

---------33:38----------
oh no man I dropped my head

---------33:47----------
it does look like it's got that strange

---------33:50----------
snot substance in it

---------33:56----------
a couple you might have seen the video

---------33:57----------
the other day where I was trying to do a

---------34:00----------
chip trying to think what it was I was

---------34:04----------
the audio I see for the iPhone 7 and it

---------34:12----------
just had this gel-like substance in it

---------34:14----------
anyway that's the same container so I'm

---------34:17----------
really not sure what has gotten into it

---------34:19----------
but it certainly made a mess of things

---------34:21----------
you can see the grain structure in this

---------34:23----------
one is substantially finer

---------34:33----------
and the flux doesn't want to oil off

---------34:43----------
need a bigger metal plate

---------34:52----------
don't don't

---------34:56----------
where can I find a big metal plate other

---------34:59----------
than in my head

---------35:10----------
you know normally I've got a box of

---------35:11----------
metal plates and random things around

---------35:15----------
the workshop yeah not today

---------35:25----------
a great thirsty I found screens I'll

---------35:28----------
pick up our perfectly good working ones

---------35:32----------
and I threw out all the dead ones of

---------35:37----------
course I did

---------35:47----------
tell me a little metal plate

---------35:56----------
I know tissues not a bad idea

---------36:12----------
so we're now doing crack solder on an

---------36:17----------
iphone6 metal backplate

---------36:56----------
this is only due another 250 centigrades

---------36:59----------
it shouldn't convert it nice to see one

---------37:06----------
Zimbabwean dollar yeah they'll probably

---------37:08----------
cost a million Zimbabwean dollars just

---------37:11----------
to send that one Zimbabwean dollar

---------37:21----------
what is this in Bob Wian dollar

---------37:23----------
situation these days I mean since

---------37:26----------
McGarvey took a hike this is a

---------37:30----------
Zimbabwean dollar actually worth the

---------37:32----------
money the plastic or paper it's printed

---------37:37----------
on anymore

---------38:19----------
gather up our iPhone it's not

---------38:32----------
remove offending particles now what I

---------38:40----------
would really love to buy for this sort

---------38:43----------
of purpose right now is a small desktop

---------38:48----------
CNC milling machine this is my stencil

---------38:53----------
bent it's slightly bent not badly just

---------38:59----------
slightly

---------39:00----------
yes anyway I would like to buy a CNC

---------39:04----------
milling machine so that I can create out

---------39:08----------
of this fiber reinforced plastic

---------39:10----------
substance proper holders for the SMC and

---------39:15----------
the stencil so you don't go through this

---------39:20----------
drama of right

---------39:24----------
guess who overcooked their

---------39:36----------
god-awful

---------39:55----------
someone let it dry out a little too much

---------40:08----------
anyway so yeah if I get a desktop cnc

---------40:10----------
system for milling then I can create

---------40:13----------
little holders for these sort of things

---------40:16----------
and you just pop down the two pieces no

---------40:19----------
tape no messing around dumb tweezers

---------40:22----------
like right now just squeegee over the

---------40:27----------
combination with your plastic blade with

---------40:32----------
paste and you're done and all this

---------40:36----------
absolute bollocks trash that I'm going

---------40:40----------
through right now would be non required

---------40:53----------
rhodesia you know let's say that anymore

---------40:57----------
but yes it was the breadbasket of the

---------41:01----------
country

---------41:12----------
the ANC's going to come and get you for

---------41:14----------
saying that

---------41:26----------
3d printers is not going to be any good

---------41:28----------
for me unfortunately

---------41:29----------
who said that John yeah because I'm

---------41:35----------
gonna need to be able to whatever

---------41:38----------
brilliant has to cope with the direct

---------41:40----------
heat so personally I prefer a Desktop

---------41:44----------
CNC I mean there any about 1,200 bucks

---------41:49----------
for a good one

---------41:50----------
some of these look a little stuck so I'm

---------41:52----------
gonna drop in some flux and then yeah

---------41:56----------
give it a chance to loosen up kangaroo

---------42:02----------
meat see we're talking at that kangaroo

---------42:06----------
meat is kind of like a blamed ostrich

---------42:09----------
meat at least with ostrich meat you've

---------42:14----------
got the beautiful deep purple and hints

---------42:18----------
of something interesting this kangaroo

---------42:22----------
meat is more like a dark beef and like

---------42:28----------
ostrich meat though it is pretty much

---------42:31----------
without fat so if you do want to make it

---------42:34----------
tasty it takes a heck of a lot of work

---------42:42----------
there we go finally got out we lost a

---------42:45----------
ball

---------42:54----------
because we're gonna lose a shop right

---------42:56----------
now be fired out of a cannon into the

---------43:00----------
Sun

---------43:08----------
yeah Lois I'm not stripping okay

---------43:11----------
if you like I can strip some nuts but my

---------43:17----------
car is still in the workshop

---------43:39----------
I mean here comes the fun bit getting

---------43:41----------
that ball to stick with the audit

---------43:45----------
jumping to its neighbor

---------43:50----------
there we go

---------43:58----------
there was a lot of drama thought it was

---------44:01----------
I'm ashamed to say pretty sure I've got

---------44:06----------
some mixed bowl sizes but we don't judge

---------44:09----------
here

---------44:30----------
yeah those it look intolerable

---------44:42----------
do you hate how we get all these little

---------44:44----------
threads

---------44:45----------
[Music]

---------44:48----------
there's a few little issues there

---------44:52----------
so we'll flux it and reflow it

---------45:21----------
so shiny

---------45:31----------
he was complaining about my balls when I

---------45:37----------
sort of got 20s

---------45:41----------
24 is complaining about my balls Aurelio

---------45:46----------
I should save two for

---------45:55----------
and finally we come back down to what

---------45:59----------
this is all for and that's this little

---------46:01----------
board here

---------46:04----------
[Applause]

---------46:07----------
I'm going to turn around so that Lewis

---------46:09----------
doesn't have an aneurysm

---------46:26----------
if we just put a little bit of flux on

---------46:28----------
here because we don't want this thing

---------46:31----------
floating away as if some great tsunami

---------46:35----------
grabbed it dragging it off into the

---------46:38----------
ocean and that should be a pretty well

---------46:44----------
aligned that can hit it with the hot air

---------46:46----------
there yeah

---------47:06----------
we was getting heart attack good Luis

---------47:10----------
wouldn't know Luis doesn't understand

---------47:14----------
proper flux etiquette she's gonna be

---------47:18----------
pushed off to the side a little and up

---------47:30----------
nah

---------47:34----------
they should pull in okay

---------47:39----------
we gave me proper MacBook temperatures

---------47:45----------
none of this Tunney iPhone stuff

---------48:39----------
dance

---------48:53----------
I don't even check to see if I got the

---------48:55----------
dot in the right spot

---------48:57----------
pretty sure it's there on this one

---------49:35----------
yep we got in the right spot cool

---------49:48----------
okay they connect

---------49:50----------
yeah I mean I know the pins on the

---------49:52----------
underside do make a nice little arrow

---------49:55----------
but sometimes you just forget to

---------49:58----------
double-check that okay

---------50:11----------
some who uses bloomin Tamil pace that

---------50:18----------
has a brown gold color to it what the

---------50:20----------
heck let's go bro

---------50:24----------
must be better now you see if I was Lois

---------50:35----------
at this point I would probably just fire

---------50:40----------
this up willy-nilly trusting in the CPU

---------50:45----------
not to spontaneously combust

---------50:47----------
someone has bent that damn thing by the

---------50:52----------
way people if you're pulling apart these

---------50:55----------
MacBook Airs for the love of God stop

---------50:59----------
forgetting the screw that's down here or

---------51:02----------
right the one that's down by the hinge

---------51:09----------
connector hidden under the Wi-Fi cables

---------51:13----------
stop forgetting it did you get these

---------51:19----------
people in they yank on it but come on me

---------51:22----------
up coming out then something horrible

---------51:28----------
happens Russman you selling me awful

---------51:33----------
really

---------51:34----------
Oh gonna have more guests later this is

---------51:38----------
my channel now

---------51:42----------
pretty sure gold thermal paste a tub of

---------51:45----------
really cheap thermal paste well that's

---------51:46----------
probably true

---------51:47----------
I would definitely believe that this is

---------51:52----------
gonna have to go in the ultrasonic

---------51:53----------
afterwards just for the heck of it Lois

---------51:58----------
did you get to try ultrasonic King and

---------52:00----------
flushing without using alcohol at the

---------52:02----------
end just doing distilled water because

---------52:05----------
I'm gonna do that this is my cheap nasty

---------52:10----------
non crest of just sonic cleaner

---------52:19----------
if you're not using crest you must be

---------52:21----------
using the best okay this is a 34-7 37 so

---------52:28----------
it's not gonna matter that it's not

---------52:29----------
original but yeah let's see you ever go

---------52:38----------
wow we really got nothing no no there we

---------52:43----------
go we had a fan spin hey it's got to

---------52:47----------
stop okay

---------52:50----------
stand up again yes anyone will stop and

---------52:57----------
start again

---------52:58----------
come on yes and let's see yeah we got

---------53:03----------
CPU activity so for good

---------53:05----------
so that's fixed up in spite of all the

---------53:08----------
dramas that was painful doing that SMC I

---------53:17----------
do apologize that you'll have to put up

---------53:19----------
with that it's very hard in the flat

---------53:25----------
earth society to keep spheres as spheres

---------53:28----------
because they keep wanting to regress

---------53:29----------
back to flat disks so I think that's

---------53:33----------
what happened to the solder paste is it

---------53:34----------
really wanted to return to its natural

---------53:36----------
form which everyone knows as a flat disc

---------53:38----------
with a icy boundary and yeah I'm

---------53:43----------
butchering by you know when that happens

---------53:45----------
it makes very hard to do these SMC ball

---------53:47----------
jobs so thanks Ben yeah paint spin right

---------53:53----------
okay so now I actually have another one

---------53:55----------
of these to do but I've also got a three

---------53:59----------
one one five I need to do okay so this

---------54:06----------
one can go back to the person who's

---------54:08----------
desperately waiting for it what's this

---------54:16----------
right your son here says mind and it

---------54:21----------
says works but the truth is it doesn't

---------54:23----------
work because I took the SMC off it to

---------54:26----------
test it on something else and then I

---------54:28----------
blew it up and because I blew it up

---------54:33----------
money I have to replace it so that I

---------54:40----------
have my own 3437 for myself

---------54:56----------
Oh brilliant don't have any parts on

---------55:00----------
knocked off then you see that Louis see

---------55:05----------
how it just changed scenes on a time

---------55:06----------
aren't you jealous be jealous of me

---------55:10----------
Louis be jealous say it's like me that

---------55:18----------
back to you wish your setup was as good

---------55:21----------
as this oh well back to the microscope

---------55:24----------
oh it's so good it's so good it almost

---------55:29----------
makes up for the fact that I'm an

---------55:31----------
Australian right that's how you're gonna

---------55:33----------
justify it

---------55:52----------
every using GU Twix here because it any

---------55:56----------
of any other techspray stuff so Chris

---------56:00----------
long is watching he will cry a little

---------56:02----------
because he is the techspray boss there

---------56:08----------
we go

---------56:13----------
that's that's good

---------56:16----------
this one here a bit around the bend one

---------56:20----------
of this one showing signs of yeah I

---------56:27----------
can't see any bubbling on this one I

---------56:29----------
think what happened with this one is

---------56:30----------
that I was a dum-dum and I tried

---------56:34----------
scratching in a date code at the top and

---------56:36----------
I have a feeling that these chips do not

---------56:39----------
like having scratches done on the top

---------56:43----------
and I figure I must have damaged

---------56:45----------
something anyway oh I'm gonna do that

---------56:48----------
again that's so much I know

---------56:57----------
was the fifth quake warning in Hawaii

---------56:59----------
seriously

---------57:16----------
yeah that's nice Neil's Tunes

---------57:20----------
yeah I'm not gonna try announcer yes

---------57:23----------
Neil's that's me so here we go again

---------57:29----------
deja vu this one could be in trouble

---------57:33----------
because seal that's burnt off so it

---------57:38----------
might mean that someone's been here

---------57:40----------
before me someone's being facetious

---------57:48----------
facetious is good lightin yeah I'm not a

---------57:55----------
huge flux user probably because you know

---------58:01----------
I don't make any money out of using

---------58:02----------
excess flux or encouraging people to use

---------58:04----------
excess flux I only make money out of

---------58:07----------
encouraging people to use my board view

---------58:09----------
software so if you are a technician and

---------58:13----------
you do more than one Macbook a day or

---------58:15----------
maybe even like one a week then I

---------58:17----------
recommend you buy my software buy my

---------58:19----------
software buy my software and if you're

---------58:23----------
looking for board views for MacBooks

---------58:26----------
don't ask me I didn't have any

---------58:30----------
unlike zxw fan board or easy drool I

---------58:35----------
legally cannot supply anything like that

---------58:38----------
because if I do because of the

---------58:41----------
Australian United States free trade

---------58:43----------
agreement legally I can end up in very

---------58:48----------
big trouble

---------58:52----------
but amusingly even though I asked plenty

---------58:55----------
of people to you know give people an

---------58:57----------
opportunity go look look here's a chance

---------58:59----------
you want to offer a bundle of schematics

---------59:01----------
and stuff at that and I'll link to you

---------59:05----------
and you can make money you keep it all

---------59:08----------
for yourself and I'll link no one really

---------59:10----------
takes it up

---------59:11----------
no one goes for see poly ethics what

---------59:19----------
language do you write your software in

---------59:21----------
curious from a programmers perspective

---------59:24----------
let's see well it's predominantly C++

---------59:27----------
just generic I don't know what stain it

---------59:31----------
is don't ask me what stain it is it's

---------59:33----------
like 11 or 14 or something and I also

---------59:37----------
grossly contaminated it with NCC because

---------59:41----------
I am traditionally an NCC programmer

---------59:45----------
it's where I feel most comfortable fancy

---------59:49----------
things are objects and vectors and

---------59:52----------
strings are not my normal sort of thing

---------59:57----------
so yeah predominantly C++ there's a

---------60:01----------
smattering of C in there most of the see

---------60:03----------
now is constrained to certain modules

---------60:07----------
that are used and crass in a few other

---------60:11----------
projects and so it's easy for me to just

---------60:15----------
do them in C come on get off there we go

---------60:32----------
and for those of you don't do a lot of

---------60:35----------
MacBook repairs or any it's not just for

---------60:38----------
mac books by the way it's for all

---------60:39----------
laptops that have foam board views there

---------60:44----------
is open would view of course which is

---------60:47----------
also maintained by myself and peer nerve

---------60:50----------
and a couple of others mostly myself and

---------60:53----------
pianos and by maintaining I mean we look

---------60:58----------
at the issues that come up on it and we

---------61:00----------
sort of go can't be bothered that's not

---------61:04----------
true we're both just over busy with

---------61:06----------
other things

---------61:13----------
you know that was a nice clean pool with

---------61:16----------
no excessive flux dregs everywhere

---------61:25----------
I'm just using the flux interesting ly

---------61:28----------
enough to get that silicon off

---------61:31----------
I find it tends to the flux sort of

---------61:35----------
makes it let go a little bit

---------61:44----------
well you do have to get that silicon off

---------61:48----------
if you don't your stencil will sit flat

---------61:51----------
and then you'll do a bad reball like I

---------61:56----------
did

---------62:04----------
I don't really find Victor's and objects

---------62:08----------
and things like that habit to deal with

---------62:10----------
them just simply well do use the word

---------62:12----------
that was used just before being

---------62:14----------
facetious just a heart no wonder I'm

---------62:19----------
dying here

---------62:25----------
I started object-orientated programming

---------62:26----------
back with ball and Pascal would have

---------62:29----------
been ninety one or two so I'm more than

---------62:35----------
fine with it but I do find my affinity

---------62:38----------
is a lot more with just plain C I've

---------62:44----------
written a book on plain C on just all

---------62:47----------
the horrors that it can bring out so if

---------62:50----------
you let me write it down here so it's an

---------62:57----------
incomplete book being incomplete for

---------62:59----------
about twenty years now the C of peril

---------63:09----------
yeah it's free it's on my website it

---------63:12----------
just lists all the nasty functions and

---------63:15----------
all that but like all good open-source

---------63:17----------
stuff it's incomplete and a bit dodgy

---------63:38----------
I lack the confidence on this one

---------63:44----------
I fear I'm gonna let Julia Child's down

---------63:49----------
github I don't know if I happening on

---------63:53----------
github

---------63:54----------
it's Stephanie on my website so if you

---------63:59----------
get a if you google see apparel Paul

---------64:02----------
Daniels it should give you the link

---------64:05----------
[Applause]

---------64:11----------
what's a welcome find it don't

---------64:28----------
he's going to switch things around a bit

---------64:33----------
so control to

---------64:51----------
all right

---------64:55----------
no no no no no no this will have to do

---------65:01----------
I think it's under open-source maybe

---------65:17----------
these are all just some of the projects

---------65:19----------
I've done

---------65:23----------
you're right it's not there hmm okay

---------65:26----------
pull bill daniels come see see the

---------65:37----------
apparel there we go

---------65:42----------
coffee

---------66:10----------
assertive of questions about how I'm

---------66:12----------
streaming in such high quality I have 40

---------66:15----------
megabits per second upload 100 down I'm

---------66:22----------
doing this on a I 580 400 machine but I

---------66:28----------
don't have any GPU and these are all

---------66:31----------
it's all was a USB cameras which kind of

---------66:37----------
lets things down a bit

---------66:47----------
probably the best intern in Australia

---------66:49----------
probably I only wish I was joking too

---------66:53----------
but unfortunately so far as internet

---------66:56----------
goes Australia is atrocious

---------66:58----------
we sold our future so that Murdoch

---------67:05----------
Rupert Murdoch would not complain and so

---------67:09----------
instead of getting fiber to the premises

---------67:10----------
in all new places and stuff up there we

---------67:14----------
just get junk now absolute junk

---------67:25----------
I should have it but we sold ourselves

---------67:30----------
because we didn't like the idea of

---------67:32----------
having to pay more money on something

---------67:35----------
but

---------67:42----------
now that might do

---------67:45----------
now this one has yeah here we go this

---------67:48----------
one has actually slightly popcorned it's

---------67:51----------
right there see that that's no good it

---------67:58----------
probably does work but I'm not gonna put

---------68:00----------
that back into the machine especially

---------68:02----------
cause it'll be mine so it's no good

---------68:12----------
so I have to ditched that I go straight

---------68:15----------
into the bin

---------68:21----------
and I'll have to wait to my next supply

---------68:24----------
of SMC's arrived it's okay I had to

---------68:33----------
change gloves

---------68:52----------
David it's more a case of I've seen it

---------68:54----------
before and so I knew what I was looking

---------68:55----------
for it it's just small parts of the

---------68:59----------
board that come out as a more of a shiny

---------69:02----------
gold color you can see the traces they

---------69:06----------
come out more shiny gold and usually

---------69:08----------
that's where it started to delaminate

---------69:15----------
start over yeah well I've got a three

---------69:17----------
one one five I need to do so I guess

---------69:22----------
we'll do that

---------69:25----------
I didn't think I had any 3-1-1 fives but

---------69:27----------
I was lucky and found one

---------69:36----------
my hands are too

---------69:41----------
too sticky and clammy can't get my

---------69:45----------
gloves back home and look at that

---------69:53----------
el amante well I'm sorry that Luis isn't

---------69:56----------
here for you I'm just gonna go wash my

---------70:00----------
hands

---------70:43----------
the baby powder would be good I don't

---------70:47----------
have any

---------70:53----------
maybe I'll just do this one into my

---------70:54----------
hands dry off because at least I don't

---------70:57----------
have to do any flux on this one

---------71:09----------
now hunts the Dana boys just come from

---------71:13----------
places I aliexpress five seconds of

---------71:19----------
googling or searching on Aliexpress

---------71:22----------
you'll have all the donors you need

---------71:31----------
I'm so sick of these boards drifting

---------71:34----------
when I try to

---------71:41----------
it's like a

---------71:44----------
pin the little SI bees down

---------72:02----------
they with that pop Corning of the SMC is

---------72:04----------
it's obviously it's pretty sure it's

---------72:06----------
something I'm doing I'm just not sure

---------72:08----------
what yet of too much heat too much

---------72:10----------
something and maybe they will work but I

---------72:16----------
understand trust them

---------72:22----------
maybe Luis can influence lend his great

---------72:26----------
experience with SMC's to let me know

---------73:00----------
also if you're not completely bored and

---------73:04----------
you can tolerate the Australian accent

---------73:06----------
and you can always jump over to my own

---------73:10----------
YouTube channel since I am hijacking

---------73:12----------
Lewis's though unlike Lewis I do not

---------73:16----------
have eight hundred and twenty thousand

---------73:18----------
raving fans that don't spin instead I'm

---------73:23----------
a little more moderate I tend not to

---------73:26----------
swear as much either and perhaps best of

---------73:29----------
all I'm not from New York instead I'm

---------73:33----------
just a wholesome Australian he loves

---------73:35----------
these animals fixes boards and takes a

---------73:39----------
beating quietly from Lewis Rossman

---------73:41----------
whenever he can't work out how to use

---------73:43----------
the software properly because that's

---------73:46----------
what New York people do

---------73:57----------
not with the flats on this actually

---------73:59----------
sorry mess that up

---------74:12----------
the flux should hopefully distributed

---------74:14----------
the heat underneath a bit better

---------74:40----------
I don't know if being a New York person

---------74:43----------
really is that unwholesome but hey if

---------74:45----------
we're just in the process of bagging

---------74:48----------
people out since I don't normally get to

---------74:51----------
have my say on the channel when Lewis is

---------74:56----------
beating the hell out of my software then

---------74:58----------
it's a perfect opportunity right now for

---------75:00----------
me to drop in some retaliatory love

---------75:19----------
and most of these pads are oxidized so

---------75:24----------
it's not going to be much fun

---------75:53----------
it's gonna get ya finally got the gloves

---------75:56----------
on just a bit of a tight fit mastery of

---------76:04----------
chief if you don't know who the hell

---------76:06----------
Paul Daniels is then what can I say

---------76:09----------
sit down time to learn let everybody

---------76:13----------
else indoctrinate you with their

---------76:16----------
versions of who they think I am listen

---------76:21----------
to the seething Australian drawl

---------76:23----------
combined with the marvelous sounds of

---------76:26----------
the few Hood trying desperately to save

---------76:34----------
me from dying

---------77:03----------
good that [ __ ] out of there

---------77:09----------
well this is a deep fake someone's on to

---------77:12----------
me

---------77:12----------
somebody really knows that I'm just a

---------77:14----------
construct

---------77:18----------
time for this Agent Smith detail it over

---------77:20----------
here

---------77:22----------
[Applause]

---------77:39----------
[Applause]

---------77:46----------
ah that [ __ ] just such over the [ __ ]

---------77:51----------
that really does stick around a lot

---------78:24----------
yeah Master Chief right yes kind of

---------78:29----------
wondering about your when you say the

---------78:32----------
simple software I'm kind of wondering

---------78:34----------
what the implication is the they I mean

---------78:41----------
yes the software is technically fairly

---------78:45----------
straightforward single function to the

---------78:49----------
point on purpose because there's also

---------78:54----------
flex PV

---------79:00----------
and flex PV is considerably more complex

---------79:12----------
[Applause]

---------79:17----------
when I put that iPhone that I tortured

---------79:20----------
and here we go

---------79:25----------
so some more torturing on this iPhone

---------79:35----------
don't you curl up like that like a

---------79:49----------
that does look rather unappealing

---------79:59----------
I see a challenger has arrived

---------80:07----------
yes the multimedia software was done in

---------80:09----------
C alright now there's some pasture C++

---------80:15----------
in there yeah because certain some of

---------80:19----------
the API is required string to be passed

---------80:22----------
to them so technically it's a C++

---------80:26----------
program but it's written mostly of C

---------80:41----------
hey Alex love lower for you Damien asked

---------80:45----------
me last night

---------80:49----------
give this a look another hip maybe this

---------80:55----------
is gonna go rather stiff on us once it

---------80:57----------
cools down

---------81:13----------
this is how you keep the SMC crack

---------81:16----------
addicts happy

---------81:39----------
yeah what I'm doing

---------81:53----------
it's not even aligned right

---------82:10----------
now there might be some iron in the

---------82:12----------
templates not sure but X for God's sake

---------82:19----------
come on

---------82:46----------
I think I need short tweezers on this

---------82:48----------
because I keep hitting my microscope

---------82:50----------
with

---------83:41----------
let's go with that

---------83:49----------
Thank You Sonia for watching over things

---------83:50----------
I appreciate that

---------83:59----------
and to our news out there trying to talk

---------84:03----------
to me and I keep missing it or something

---------84:05----------
I do apologize

---------84:06----------
unfortunately my brain is not

---------84:08----------
constructed in the same marvelous way in

---------84:10----------
which Lewis Rothman's brain is

---------84:11----------
constructed I mean that chap is an

---------84:16----------
exemplary example I kind of sounded

---------84:19----------
funny of a brain that is wired and

---------84:22----------
capable of doing some amazing things

---------84:24----------
with concurrently talking to people

---------84:27----------
reciting incredible batches of numbers

---------84:31----------
working on a board and reading chat I

---------84:35----------
don't know how he does it he's certainly

---------84:39----------
a master

---------84:44----------
oh yeah you want to jump out you try

---------84:46----------
that move all you try jumping out ya

---------84:48----------
know the stencil has bent slightly okay

---------84:57----------
your balls just retract back in thank

---------84:59----------
you so I can finish off your little sort

---------85:04----------
of neighbors

---------85:10----------
a few of those balls have not gone onto

---------85:13----------
their pads

---------85:19----------
a triptych

---------85:23----------
now if any we could blame it on the

---------85:26----------
metal plate oily metal plate event

---------85:30----------
there's no denying he was already

---------85:33----------
brilliant before that and I think maybe

---------85:36----------
the metal plate event just pushed him up

---------85:39----------
to that extra level Tim Homans another

---------85:46----------
one of those people that can just recite

---------85:48----------
the heck out of anything like if I have

---------85:54----------
a problem with a board like particular

---------85:57----------
model or something and I don't know

---------85:58----------
which is which I just I messaged him

---------86:01----------
harass poor Tim so much because I can

---------86:06----------
never remember this stuff

---------86:10----------
yeah we're gonna lose probably one ball

---------86:12----------
up here we'll see there we go

---------86:16----------
the reason why we're gonna lose it is

---------86:18----------
because I was a lazy git and didn't

---------86:21----------
clean my pads properly and now that

---------86:28----------
laziness has come home to roost

---------86:30----------
I've definitely offline blah blah blah

---------86:32----------
blah blah what's one down the bottom

---------86:34----------
left bottom left but I'm right

---------86:44----------
so I can't really afford to scrub this

---------86:46----------
until I have put that missing ball in

---------86:53----------
place and reef load everything

---------86:59----------
okay so we need to get this ball here

---------87:02----------
out

---------87:12----------
okay

---------87:15----------
and I should probably scratch back that

---------87:18----------
Pat's slightly

---------87:24----------
who needs maybe when you have Google

---------87:26----------
well yeah that's pretty much how I live

---------87:28----------
my life now it's like I appreciate and

---------87:36----------
marvel the people who have these amazing

---------87:39----------
recalls and yeah that's about it

---------87:49----------
I appreciate it Marvin

---------87:53----------
because I know I certainly don't have

---------87:55----------
that capacity myself

---------88:06----------
and I don't really feel bad about it for

---------88:09----------
because I wake up every morning and

---------88:11----------
forget that I don't have that capacity

---------88:12----------
myself

---------88:25----------
some part of that paddle all

---------88:30----------
okay

---------88:32----------
is it like 2 a.m. in Australia no it's

---------88:35----------
actually only 10 p.m. here 10:00 p.m. on

---------88:37----------
the eastern side which means it's even

---------88:40----------
earlier than that on the other country

---------88:42----------
side of our country which is Western

---------88:44----------
Australia now Western Australia really

---------88:47----------
needs to get their act together and come

---------88:49----------
up with a name for their own country

---------88:50----------
instead of just hanging on to Australia

---------88:54----------
inside the beam with us for a couple

---------88:58----------
hundred years and they still haven't

---------88:59----------
sorted themselves out okay we've got

---------89:03----------
some pretty damn uneven balls around

---------89:06----------
there so it's not a good thing so this

---------89:12----------
one here and that one there we can be

---------89:15----------
stupid and try and reduce that size but

---------89:20----------
you can see these are pretty little good

---------89:24----------
but there's a whole cluster here that's

---------89:26----------
wrong so that's all gonna have to come

---------89:28----------
off

---------89:38----------
Oh will

---------89:41----------
it was nice knowing you balls

---------89:48----------
probably something that a lot of my cats

---------89:50----------
before I when they get back home I'm

---------89:54----------
live it

---------90:14----------
build us up to do that again

---------90:30----------
I could have left it there and I could

---------90:32----------
have taken my chances because the SMC's

---------90:35----------
are fairly so far as balls go they're

---------90:40----------
quite tolerant but

---------90:46----------
given that this is the only three one

---------90:48----------
one five I have on hand I would prefer

---------90:52----------
that I get it right as much as I can

---------91:00----------
I've got more three one-fives coming but

---------91:02----------
none here tonight

---------91:25----------
[Applause]

---------91:26----------
perfectionist much well a little but

---------91:31----------
like I said it's I do have a fairly

---------91:35----------
tolerant range of different ball sizes

---------91:37----------
but that was just pushing it too far

---------91:39----------
that I knew was going to result in

---------91:44----------
trouble

---------91:56----------
whose junk on there now

---------92:28----------
hey let's pay daily yes you did indeed

---------92:31----------
catch a live stream though unfortunately

---------92:33----------
for you it's not such a great thing

---------92:35----------
because this isn't a Louis rossmann of

---------92:38----------
live stream this in fact is a fake flat

---------92:41----------
earther live stream

---------92:55----------
but to make you all feel cozy and

---------92:58----------
everything I am still performing the

---------93:02----------
normal sort of things that Luis would do

---------93:04----------
which includes getting aggravated SMC's

---------93:08----------
complaining about how the SMC stencil

---------93:10----------
isn't flat yeah stuff like that it's

---------93:13----------
tough but he would be doing right now if

---------93:16----------
he was in the workshop

---------93:35----------
P contaminating the stencil

---------93:54----------
all right it's gonna make some paste

---------94:02----------
she has this stuff looking it's just a I

---------94:05----------
took it a bit too far so I've created a

---------94:09----------
lot of distortion when I'm trying to

---------94:13----------
push that into the holes of the stencil

---------94:23----------
okay can someone kill the Linux master

---------94:25----------
91

---------94:45----------
giving a bad name to Linux Linux Linux

---------94:48----------
take your pick

---------94:53----------
well I just realized that's 420 whoops

---------95:29----------
I think you're not but he did that it's

---------95:32----------
any audio I don't recognize the tone you

---------95:35----------
would hear

---------95:39----------
okay this little wetter than I like

---------95:47----------
since we've got the most

---------95:52----------
that's what most of the heat down on it

---------95:56----------
maybe we'll be okay

---------96:13----------
I'm suspecting not there

---------96:41----------
now can anyone see the problem here see

---------96:45----------
how when I push down things come back up

---------96:48----------
that means the stencil is legitimately

---------96:50----------
bent and because the paste isn't super

---------96:57----------
dry there's gonna be a degree of wicking

---------97:00----------
between them now Oh see there we go

---------97:12----------
maybe five

---------97:15----------
yeah not that damn

---------97:23----------
seriously

---------97:28----------
let it be known to all of you but if you

---------97:31----------
should ever get the pleasure of

---------97:32----------
live-streaming be sure you haven't

---------97:36----------
changed your formula before you do it

---------97:57----------
because it just makes you look like

---------97:58----------
complete [ __ ]

---------98:20----------
right I put my toothbrush

---------98:27----------
not as well as I actually have new

---------98:28----------
stencils why don't I just do that

---------98:42----------
come on stencil where I so no Lewis sent

---------98:47----------
me about three of them there we go

---------99:18----------
so yeah it is a bit of a touchy-feely

---------99:20----------
thing because you're dealing there with

---------99:26----------
so many variables

---------99:34----------
the stencil fills bent out of the bag

---------99:47----------
oh no it's like a

---------99:50----------
I think I'm now at the point where

---------99:52----------
paranoia is starting to rule my life

---------100:04----------
hey Luke yes a bit of a hell of a

---------100:10----------
coincidence fancy seeing you around hope

---------100:13----------
you been well certainly a lot of things

---------100:17----------
have changed in the years

---------100:26----------
see a junk pile thanks for sticking

---------100:29----------
around

---------100:36----------
I'm gonna mix in some slightly drier

---------100:39----------
stuff and hopefully we can get a

---------100:42----------
combination

---------100:46----------
it doesn't completely suck

---------101:04----------
see the sad thing is SMC is usually take

---------101:07----------
me about maybe 10 minutes to do so you

---------101:09----------
know I'm not brilliantly fast at them

---------101:11----------
but at the same time it's not usually a

---------101:14----------
complete another festival of

---------101:17----------
disappointment like this one

---------101:39----------
so you moved Alice brings the name Tom

---------101:42----------
price still in China yes I'm still sadly

---------101:46----------
here a few of my mouth almost wore on I

---------101:54----------
swore a cure of my projects didn't quite

---------101:59----------
pan out quite as Luka dutifully as I had

---------102:02----------
hoped I also didn't help in that I

---------102:05----------
watched up a few of the opportunities

---------102:09----------
that were handed to me but hey you know

---------102:12----------
that's just the thing to do in life

---------102:14----------
but I am where I am and there the last

---------102:20----------
few years it's been a interesting game

---------102:24----------
of doing all this MacBook stuff or

---------102:27----------
repairs in general

---------102:32----------
quite a bit different what I was doing

---------102:34----------
over there

---------102:41----------
no more fancy life down in the gutter

---------102:46----------
with everyone else now

---------102:51----------
jeez dad just punched the hole out of

---------102:53----------
that I did too

---------103:00----------
I might put the bowl in there later now

---------103:04----------
come on Paul do it right

---------103:19----------
in my blood type a let's see I am an A+

---------103:23----------
actually Oh close that's close

---------103:39----------
and when you can't work out with you or

---------103:41----------
in focus or whether your eyeballs are

---------103:43----------
just stuffed up this pace still isn't

---------103:48----------
quite dry enough

---------104:17----------
so help me God if that little ball in

---------104:19----------
the middle of drifts over and textures

---------104:21----------
into someone I'm going to get upset stay

---------104:25----------
in the middle buddy okay cool this

---------104:32----------
temper Hannity Mac I don't have a XS

---------104:36----------
MacBook problem in fact up here I don't

---------104:39----------
get a lot at all because there's only

---------104:40----------
about 8,000 people in the town so in

---------104:45----------
terms of local jobs pretty much it's

---------104:47----------
more like three or four a year so I rely

---------104:52----------
more on mail-in jobs I could always do

---------104:58----------
with more MacBook jobs

---------105:17----------
geez who these [ __ ] get rid of

---------105:21----------
buying Ben vine YouTube where these

---------105:25----------
people come from

---------105:31----------
now Richard Denton I might try that

---------105:33----------
tomorrow did you mention that earlier

---------105:35----------
didn't it I'll give it a whirl tomorrow

---------105:47----------
hey Teresa

---------105:57----------
move back to front here at the moment

---------106:02----------
and I'll let that sit too long

---------106:23----------
well it's better

---------106:29----------
and the balls generally do look quite

---------106:32----------
even there

---------106:45----------
the terrain what do you mean by what do

---------106:48----------
I gain from it I mean effectively it's a

---------106:50----------
job hey thanks Pvt donut zero effect

---------106:58----------
good to see ya what's the biggest

---------107:00----------
expense I have at the moment yeah a good

---------107:05----------
question

---------107:05----------
I can't quite thang

---------107:15----------
I think the biggest expense really is

---------107:17----------
the lack of consistency in the jobs like

---------107:24----------
I can go but this week's been pretty

---------107:26----------
good but then there are the weeks where

---------107:29----------
just dies right off I mean as does

---------107:31----------
happen in normal life but it can be

---------107:35----------
that's the real expense the

---------107:37----------
inconsistency okay two [ __ ] on the

---------107:43----------
left no they're not bridges that's just

---------107:44----------
a bit of flux residue yeah but thanks

---------107:51----------
for noticing anyway

---------108:03----------
I can go there

---------108:28----------
oh all right now five is truly game I

---------108:35----------
could try and replace that straight

---------108:38----------
there but I'm not so I am going to take

---------108:43----------
the board out to do the SMC replacement

---------108:57----------
I had to gonna close my shop and leave

---------109:00----------
the workshop back home I think a lot of

---------109:02----------
people are moving into that sort of

---------109:04----------
thing now particularly with the Internet

---------109:08----------
the compelling reasons to have a

---------109:13----------
storefront starting to sort of fall away

---------109:16----------
quite severely so ye enough with the

---------109:21----------
storefront is more rent and stuff like

---------109:23----------
that because it depends on your

---------109:26----------
situation there are some residential

---------109:29----------
codes that will stop you from doing that

---------109:30----------
of course

---------109:37----------
blasts Vesperia yeah that's correct

---------109:40----------
I have not really touched anything like

---------109:44----------
that in well it's gonna be getting on 20

---------109:46----------
years now

---------109:52----------
Thanks hi hi

---------109:55----------
have you study was going okay

---------110:02----------
what are your thoughts on the atomic pie

---------110:04----------
which one is the atomic pile Oh the

---------110:06----------
normal pie and I know the the mini part

---------110:12----------
of the pie that has nothing else but

---------110:14----------
just the chip inert speaker I've got a

---------110:20----------
couple of raspberry pies myself but I

---------110:22----------
ain't using for much was meant to use

---------110:25----------
them as little streaming units I've

---------110:29----------
never quite got around to finishing that

---------110:31----------
up too many things to do

---------110:42----------
that out need normal screwdriver

---------110:53----------
can tell me what live I mobile device

---------110:56----------
coming for you live on mobile devices as

---------111:01----------
far as I know it's a Linux library that

---------111:03----------
allows you to talk to Apple I devices so

---------111:09----------
you can do various I don't need that you

---------111:14----------
can do various things with the iPhones

---------111:17----------
like I use it in combination get it out

---------111:23----------
of here

---------111:24----------
a device backup - that's the one to use

---------111:27----------
that'll let you back up your iPhone

---------111:29----------
without using iTunes it's a new mayor

---------111:40----------
thing good until Adam are they actually

---------111:41----------
using the Intel atoms they still produce

---------111:43----------
in the Intel Atom

---------111:45----------
I thought they sort of stopped that and

---------111:47----------
just measured in as the I already call

---------111:51----------
it the solar on chip now I wasn't aware

---------111:54----------
of that

---------112:00----------
hey Brad Pitt as again down and tazzy

---------112:04----------
dubash I was living down there to be

---------112:06----------
honest most of the year it's certainly

---------112:12----------
far more respectable weather than what

---------112:15----------
we're dealing with up here we we're

---------112:19----------
still in the mid mid to high 20s every

---------112:21----------
day and at nighttime it's only getting

---------112:24----------
down to 16 so still feel perpetually hot

---------112:37----------
they sound effects good to see you

---------112:40----------
around okay and just to expand on what

---------112:45----------
sound effects just sit there are certain

---------112:48----------
situations where I can help out most of

---------112:50----------
the time they do expect to cough up a

---------112:53----------
normal price for the job like I said

---------112:56----------
they'll just sometimes as exceptions

---------112:58----------
that I can deal with but not always

---------113:03----------
here's the other thing if you're

---------113:04----------
thinking of emailing me and saying can

---------113:08----------
you do this for pretty much nothing then

---------113:09----------
I'm sorry to say that given that I do

---------113:12----------
have a bunch of cats to feed a business

---------113:16----------
around malice or stuff I am pretty much

---------113:18----------
going to ignore your email it's not out

---------113:20----------
of being not polite those paws it is a

---------113:23----------
little bit but rather it's just I gotta

---------113:26----------
prioritize things

---------113:33----------
can any management Louis's email looks

---------113:36----------
like

---------114:02----------
I hope you're running what the problem

---------114:04----------
that this board is is it doesn't detect

---------114:05----------
the battery and fairly sure it's a

---------114:11----------
classic case of someone tried to replace

---------114:16----------
the battery you used a metal implement

---------114:18----------
to disconnect the battery and things

---------114:23----------
went bad from there there's a lot of

---------114:31----------
junk under there I can't get to know

---------114:34----------
what is that hot glue no it's some kind

---------114:39----------
of silicon it's rather annoying stuff

---------114:50----------
speaking of annoying it is satisfying I

---------114:55----------
will definitely say that yes

---------114:59----------
so something about wildlife they are

---------115:01----------
gonna go back my sausage dog lost the

---------115:04----------
use of his back legs have you

---------115:05----------
experienced situation zero I'm really

---------115:09----------
not sure I'm thinking you may actually

---------115:12----------
have you checked for paralysis tick

---------115:14----------
because there is a pretty common effect

---------115:18----------
I've seen with paralysis tick so do you

---------115:21----------
hope you have a vet round place if you

---------115:24----------
can get them checked out it can be

---------115:27----------
reversed I believe

---------116:15----------
I'll sweet mercy

---------116:18----------
did you see that look at that

---------116:22----------
I knocked off what is a good dozen part

---------116:26----------
sir we're gonna have busy night now

---------116:36----------
that's because I didn't clear out the

---------116:37----------
under-filled properly and what happened

---------116:41----------
is I started to struggle and push and

---------116:45----------
when I did that I knocked all these

---------116:47----------
things off look at them all

---------116:53----------
well that was dumb

---------116:59----------
that's okay it's not the end of the

---------117:01----------
world we'll just clear it up and just

---------117:04----------
start adding and bit by bit

---------117:16----------
I think in the past I certainly would

---------117:18----------
have panic like heck over that

---------117:23----------
I probably started breathing pretty damn

---------117:25----------
pretty heavy it's not thinking oh my

---------117:28----------
gudd oh my gudd oh my gudd we're gonna

---------117:29----------
do but after a while you kind of go oh

---------117:37----------
that was dumb

---------117:39----------
and you just get down to the job and get

---------117:42----------
it done

---------117:52----------
yeah we're gonna visit three one one

---------117:55----------
five

---------118:01----------
look yeah there's I'm not flying anymore

---------118:04----------
at all I wish I was but I'm just not

---------118:14----------
there's I've got no time and I certainly

---------118:17----------
don't have the money for it anymore

---------118:30----------
I missed you in the flying I'll

---------118:32----------
definitely tell you that particularly

---------118:33----------
the discus watch definitely miss that

---------118:47----------
alright here we go

---------118:52----------
zmapp

---------118:56----------
you start this process

---------119:21----------
such a slip

---------119:38----------
pluck seems to be rare and just cost

---------119:41----------
money not all of us living on a flux

---------119:44----------
mine like Lewis

---------119:51----------
not that money is the issue is the flux

---------119:53----------
really it's just a case of I just don't

---------119:56----------
feel compelled to use that much of it

---------120:07----------
we'll say at least this is a MacBook and

---------120:09----------
not an iPhone I've had the situation

---------120:15----------
where you have people doing the touch I

---------120:18----------
see replacing on the six plus and they

---------120:22----------
forget to remove the overfill on the

---------120:27----------
other side and so you end up they end up

---------120:33----------
lifting all the parts in the overfill on

---------120:37----------
the other side and of course pretty much

---------120:38----------
nothing works after that and try as you

---------120:43----------
might try to gently pull that strip off

---------120:46----------
so that you can just sort of the parts

---------120:50----------
back down it almost never works

---------121:08----------
you have a child Chinese flux look I

---------121:13----------
mean I've got stuff that about many

---------121:16----------
years ago I've got the rosin box

---------121:27----------
but really I've got no real compelling

---------121:29----------
reason to use those sort of things

---------121:45----------
I'm gonna push my luck there whoops yeah

---------121:47----------
I was I was right on the memory chip

---------121:59----------
back and forth back and forth so boring

---------122:02----------
nothing else in human life is like this

---------122:05----------
going back and forth almost what's that

---------122:18----------
certainly one of the skills that you

---------122:20----------
learn to have early on when doing this

---------122:22----------
sort of work is the ability to hold the

---------122:24----------
little part in the tweezers while you

---------122:27----------
move everything else around you without

---------122:31----------
dropping it or more often what happens

---------122:33----------
is it gets spat out because you're

---------122:37----------
holding it too tight

---------122:46----------
hmm say 1 2 3 4

---------122:50----------
fifth ball on that one it's gonna make

---------122:53----------
sure I haven't jumped anything

---------123:03----------
sorry I'm not reading the chat much this

---------123:07----------
is kind of taking up a little bit of my

---------123:09----------
attention

---------123:34----------
we're almost the

---------123:43----------
all the resistors in the capacitors went

---------123:47----------
bye-bye because I was a little bit

---------123:52----------
exuberant with trying to twist off the

---------123:56----------
SMC when I was stuck

---------124:07----------
this is that was that last one I think

---------124:09----------
yep

---------124:47----------
don't you dare tombstone on me you okay

---------125:01----------
all right

---------125:04----------
well that was certainly some drama

---------125:15----------
that's what I get they're doing a second

---------125:17----------
lowest string yeah you asked me to do

---------125:20----------
one but then I don't think he found

---------125:23----------
anyone else that was dumb enough to do

---------125:27----------
and do one as well so he asked me to do

---------125:30----------
a second one not so go on okay fine I

---------125:32----------
got an SMC to do Shane tell me ten

---------125:35----------
minutes yeah your ten minute fallacy

---------126:05----------
it is actually amazingly hard to see

---------126:06----------
those balls the pads rather but it was

---------126:11----------
really hard to see those pads alright

---------126:15----------
let's see what we've got now we want a

---------126:18----------
three one one five guys

---------126:28----------
we got pad one down here all right

---------126:39----------
this goal sorrows so much love

---------126:47----------
if I fix this my foot will over you I'll

---------126:49----------
bet in Britain I hope not and who says

---------126:53----------
we even want to come back to Britain

---------126:59----------
you guys kicked us out

---------127:12----------
I'm not going to

---------127:19----------
yep quite right with that let's see who

---------127:22----------
said that Vogon oh yes

---------127:32----------
definitely away the jinx green jobs

---------127:35----------
state with some level of authority

---------127:38----------
mister how long it's going to take or

---------127:40----------
how hot it's going to be

---------127:54----------
Haven how these

---------127:59----------
don't do that come on there we go okay

---------128:07----------
Sonia a little low scrolled back where's

---------128:10----------
Brad

---------128:14----------
Brad Pitt you never get bigger right

---------128:19----------
Brad

---------128:23----------
I've worked for 40 schools and most of

---------128:25----------
students teachers Mac do you want me to

---------128:27----------
inquire about getting device repaired

---------128:28----------
with you clearly then us they threw Brad

---------128:31----------
absolutely absolutely 100% yes Brad do

---------128:37----------
that send me a message or email me peel

---------128:40----------
Daniels at gmail or just off my website

---------128:45----------
or give Sonya your email and I will be

---------128:50----------
in touch with you I think here which way

---------128:51----------
you do it just let me know because that

---------128:57----------
is exactly the sort of thing that I need

---------129:01----------
to get more off

---------129:07----------
and I promise I won't do too many botch

---------129:09----------
ups like this one oh you see that

---------129:14----------
as soon as I said the word botch up it

---------129:16----------
jumped you know wait for that to cool

---------129:19----------
down

---------129:29----------
rabbit

---------129:45----------
really I feel like I'm having a normal

---------129:47----------
Lois stay here

---------130:00----------
Nixie

---------130:12----------
[Applause]

---------130:13----------
I know what's going on here that's

---------130:14----------
actually stuck it seems

---------130:18----------
crap oh I'm committed now I'm gonna have

---------130:21----------
to go through with it

---------130:37----------
it is surprising how much harder I'll

---------130:40----------
put God's like that's a that's just

---------130:42----------
ruined

---------130:47----------
I think I just need to go to sleep

---------130:52----------
cannot believe that just happened

---------130:55----------
now it's time to lose my cool

---------131:19----------
that was very unwanted

---------131:27----------
because not only did I risk you and more

---------131:31----------
issues on the board and gentlemen

---------131:32----------
there's a couple of balls in there by

---------131:34----------
the way so yeah I have spotted those but

---------131:40----------
it does mean I have to now do the SMC

---------131:42----------
all over again which means I'm a risk

---------131:47----------
pop Corning up

---------131:51----------
so kind of lost the fun of doing things

---------131:55----------
right now

---------132:04----------
[Music]

---------132:07----------
this all I can do is just fix it I mean

---------132:11----------
what else the entity

---------132:15----------
really not sure what happened with the

---------132:18----------
SMC came flying at me like a like an

---------132:22----------
angry kangaroo

---------132:27----------
interesting it's like the flux for some

---------132:31----------
reason did not distribute that's very

---------132:36----------
strange

---------132:37----------
so here we are back again at this point

---------132:41----------
of pain

---------132:52----------
sad thing is out of all this basically

---------132:55----------
there's I'm doing nothing really with my

---------132:57----------
board view software it would have been a

---------133:03----------
nice thing to have a board where I could

---------133:06----------
demonstrate how it's useful but instead

---------133:09----------
I'm just demonstrating how not to do

---------133:15----------
board repairs

---------133:19----------
they're Theresa I might have to I'll

---------133:22----------
just give this one reball what is the

---------133:26----------
time we'll give it one attempt at the

---------133:29----------
reball and then if it doesn't go I'm

---------133:31----------
just gonna have to walk out

---------133:33----------
I don't like normally finishing like

---------133:36----------
this I'd like to persevere but sometimes

---------133:39----------
the smarter thing is to take a hike

---------133:52----------
yep John Smith that's right look no

---------133:54----------
one's around you let the rain man as you

---------133:57----------
said

---------134:08----------
I don't even know what I've done with my

---------134:09----------
stencils ah

---------134:23----------
aeryn aeryn aeryn

---------134:27----------
I'm not sure how to pronounce that one

---------134:31----------
thank you very much don't rage the China

---------134:39----------
outrage

---------134:42----------
I'm just fishing around in my container

---------134:44----------
of alcohol right now trying to get that

---------134:47----------
good stencil out

---------134:54----------
basically as soon as I've used the

---------134:56----------
stencil I throw it back into a tub of

---------134:58----------
alcohol and that helps it get rid of any

---------135:03----------
junk that's built up

---------135:15----------
Louis should be laughing pretty heavily

---------135:16----------
on this because I used to mock him a lot

---------135:19----------
though I still doing mock him a lot

---------135:21----------
about the whole smc process

---------135:30----------
I mean full of love of course

---------135:39----------
now you're too far gone I gotta do a new

---------135:42----------
batch

---------135:47----------
don't Hulk smash I'll try not to study

---------135:49----------
forward

---------135:51----------
Ryan Diaz I've mentioned it before the

---------135:56----------
stencil captain tape thing isn't ever a

---------135:59----------
problem with me I'm more than fine

---------136:01----------
holding it and applying the paste

---------136:25----------
thanks bap it being touched send me an

---------136:28----------
email now if you can Brad and I'll get

---------136:30----------
to that as soon as I've finished with

---------136:31----------
this so in a week was I know I shouldn't

---------136:36----------
I shouldn't mock myself like that I

---------136:38----------
could regret that

---------137:05----------
Haley o'clock

---------137:09----------
a fellow Australian are

---------138:20----------
well come on bull

---------138:38----------
fellow Queensland are you down in

---------138:40----------
Brisbane or up there the north here with

---------138:42----------
me

---------138:50----------
don't do that

---------139:11----------
I do wonder how many thousand subs Lewis

---------139:13----------
is lost now because of this

---------139:18----------
those pads are real juicy

---------139:31----------
I'm gonna get that juice out of him

---------140:11----------
got a couple D on the bottom here that

---------140:13----------
haven't quite found onto their pads so

---------140:16----------
just let him sit for a second and try

---------140:18----------
and hit him again

---------140:24----------
sometimes the flux just boils underneath

---------140:26----------
the under the paste and it's not so much

---------140:31----------
that the pad can't are the ball can't

---------140:34----------
touch the variable air it's not so much

---------140:37----------
that the ball can't bind to the pair

---------140:39----------
that's just that the flux is producing a

---------140:42----------
bit of a perhaps a Leidenfrost effect

---------140:44----------
and stopping it from getting down there

---------140:46----------
I might hit it with flux and run it

---------140:52----------
again just to be sure

---------141:04----------
richard denton if you can find me square

---------141:07----------
hold SMC stencils then by all means send

---------141:09----------
them over or let me know because yes I

---------141:12----------
do very much prefer square stencils

---------141:16----------
they're vastly better than round hold of

---------141:20----------
pain-in-the-butt ones but to the best of

---------141:24----------
my knowledge having me now to find a

---------141:26----------
square SMC stencil square hole rather

---------141:35----------
the you're going to take on that quest

---------141:39----------
please do a lot of people will be very

---------141:42----------
appreciative of it and I lost one ball

---------141:49----------
didn't I lose that bowl the last time

---------141:55----------
job is about here on my tweezers would

---------142:00----------
just stop me

---------142:07----------
every hope

---------142:14----------
if this is an hourly rate this board

---------142:16----------
repair would be costing thousands but

---------142:18----------
thankfully well that's the power of the

---------142:23----------
fixed fee system

---------142:28----------
you have a good

---------142:38----------
to 677 yeah that's why I want to get a

---------142:44----------
desktop CNC milling machine because what

---------142:48----------
I'll do is I'll take this stuff this

---------142:50----------
fiber reinforced plastic and I will cut

---------142:53----------
out recesses design for the SMC and also

---------142:57----------
for these stencils so there'll be none

---------143:00----------
of this stuffing around I'm actually

---------143:03----------
kind of shocked that someone else hasn't

---------143:04----------
done it yet I mean I would pay 20 30

---------143:08----------
bucks easily for being out of just

---------143:13----------
plunked down the sucess SMC put the

---------143:16----------
stencil on top squeegee on the paste and

---------143:19----------
go from there it would save so much time

---------143:23----------
but no one's done it yet so because no

---------143:26----------
one else has done it yet I'm gonna do it

---------143:28----------
but then I probably won't marketed I'll

---------143:31----------
just keep it for myself and make

---------143:33----------
everybody else wish they have it because

---------143:37----------
I'm a little bit I'm a little bit unlike

---------143:40----------
that

---------144:06----------
did we lose another ball we only lost

---------144:08----------
one that I was aware of

---------144:13----------
that's just the one and I'll put it back

---------144:28----------
now because the trouble with my whole

---------144:30----------
SMC holder thing is that well I've got

---------144:34----------
to get the Desktop CNC to start with and

---------144:36----------
that's a fifteen hundred dollar

---------144:39----------
investment particularly by the time I've

---------144:41----------
completely mucked around with it and

---------144:43----------
watched it up a few hundred times trying

---------144:47----------
to make it right

---------144:59----------
do you do border pay yeah I am

---------145:07----------
you lost another one oh dear god I hope

---------145:11----------
you're right because

---------145:16----------
I can't see any others no that all looks

---------145:20----------
good to me you cannot see any distinct

---------145:25----------
missing ones there

---------145:31----------
you did make me leave my SMC

---------145:47----------
and gave a machining shop 900 bucks a

---------145:49----------
square hole stencil jig they say yeah

---------145:53----------
you're on I could get a machining shop

---------145:55----------
get them to do it but then don't be a

---------145:57----------
once-off and I want to do it myself over

---------146:01----------
and over fairly sure that's famous last

---------146:08----------
words I I'm fairly sure that's right

---------147:18----------
well that was the slowest drifting on

---------147:21----------
the SMC I've seen in ages see how that

---------147:23----------
moved about three or four times before

---------147:25----------
it actually settled in indy neidell my

---------147:33----------
god what are you doing you and you know

---------147:34----------
Hill nice to see you by the way how's

---------147:37----------
things going on that side of the world

---------147:44----------
and denied Hills and I was all about my

---------147:47----------
terrible past one of those balls look

---------147:51----------
good

---------148:01----------
now chilling being I do this for a

---------148:04----------
living this is part of my living

---------148:12----------
I'm gonna touch up the ends of those I

---------148:14----------
think should I or should I not

---------148:18----------
yeah the Malone Paul test that it works

---------148:23----------
for before you do anything

---------148:28----------
oh okay

---------148:46----------
someone knows who I am Odia Indian oh I

---------148:54----------
haven't turned on IRC for a while now

---------148:59----------
not since sort of been on this discord

---------149:16----------
Oh normally it's not so much drama doing

---------149:23----------
these sm cities I think it's just luck

---------149:25----------
of the draw

---------149:31----------
well Luke if I use a it doesn't have to

---------149:35----------
be perfectly it doesn't have to have

---------149:38----------
perfect edges it can be rounded in the

---------149:41----------
corners as long as the sides are being

---------149:43----------
held that's all that matters

---------149:44----------
I have to use desktop C&C though because

---------149:47----------
I need depth control because I need to

---------149:49----------
be able to have the SMC itself sit down

---------149:52----------
and then the stencil that I use that

---------149:56----------
will be the next cutout layer and so

---------149:59----------
that will sit down on top of the SMC it

---------150:02----------
doesn't have to be the perfect depth of

---------150:04----------
the SMC but so long as they're both

---------150:06----------
trapped within the square socket then

---------150:10----------
I'd be fine all righty

---------150:15----------
hopefully I haven't ruined this whole

---------150:17----------
board those I have to get another one

---------150:21----------
and I really don't want that because it

---------150:25----------
is a three one one five and I mostly

---------150:30----------
only have 29 30 sixes

---------150:55----------
okay

---------151:05----------
I can't even remember which way this one

---------151:07----------
was meant to go ever got fan spin so if

---------151:14----------
we get CPU activity okay I've got CPU

---------151:18----------
activity so we are alive thank goodness

---------151:23----------
that was a quite the long way around I

---------151:28----------
am going to put this into the chassis

---------151:29----------
though because I need to check that the

---------151:32----------
battery detection is actually fixed I am

---------151:41----------
just going to course fit this

---------151:50----------
the other reason I'd want a desktop CNC

---------151:53----------
is because there are so many other

---------151:54----------
little jigs and whatnot that I want to

---------151:56----------
make this is just one of those things

---------152:04----------
that you just want

---------152:11----------
I'd love a jig that lets me drop these

---------152:14----------
boards in straight-up just no stuffing

---------152:19----------
around trying to find if you've got

---------152:22----------
fifty fingers yeah I think we managed to

---------152:29----------
find fifty fingers that time I don't

---------152:36----------
know why I'm caring about that

---------152:37----------
particular point this

---------152:55----------
mm-hmm

---------153:00----------
Nocturne 13 Lewis is down in the

---------153:03----------
basement chapter with Clara right there

---------153:07----------
haven't been paying me enough so I've

---------153:09----------
trapped him and I'll just simply take

---------153:15----------
over everything that they've done that's

---------153:20----------
pretty simple

---------153:30----------
all right Thank You Otto switcher you

---------153:38----------
make my life sewer you see the reason

---------153:42----------
why I did the auto switches because so

---------153:44----------
many times I would be recording I need

---------153:47----------
to realize then that I was actually

---------153:48----------
recording the wrong thing so by making

---------153:50----------
the auto switcher now I'm always

---------153:53----------
hopefully recording the right thing okay

---------154:00----------
battery is in can turn off the

---------154:04----------
microscope like I need my ASD utilities

---------154:13----------
and my cable cable

---------154:29----------
this here is just a bit less STR need

---------154:38----------
let me beat up into the appropriate

---------154:41----------
Apple system diagnostics I hope with it

---------154:47----------
was a flippant option button pain of

---------154:52----------
getting a bit older as you find it very

---------154:54----------
hard to see it close distances we have a

---------155:00----------
bomb

---------155:09----------
okay it comes out ist you want 155 wait

---------155:24----------
now what we're mostly looking for here

---------155:26----------
is that the battery does not have a

---------155:27----------
cross through it because if it's got a

---------155:28----------
cross through it then all this has been

---------155:30----------
even naught and my problem lies

---------155:32----------
elsewhere try three different batteries

---------155:37----------
they all do it

---------155:45----------
we got across three our battery now I'm

---------155:49----------
cross you gotta be kidding me replace

---------155:53----------
that isms even nothing SMC for nothing

---------155:55----------
mmm not good damn something else must

---------156:04----------
have blown

---------156:18----------
all right just

---------156:41----------
okay

---------157:32----------
[ __ ] of this schematic doesn't even

---------157:34----------
have what I'm looking for

---------157:49----------
oh yeah it does

---------158:12----------
5280 realize you're hiding out got there

---------158:41----------
5280 one just like you next year yep

---------158:44----------
your TK okay let's go let's get our ohms

---------158:51----------
made on make sure got nothing connected

---------158:56----------
good TK it is HAP I'm him then I had

---------159:09----------
high hopes no that's 2 K as well so

---------159:11----------
that's good I'm not sure what to think

---------159:37----------
then think of G 7000 because I did that

---------159:39----------
before

---------159:46----------
what's one of the veers have gone AWOL I

---------159:54----------
might have to leave this one till

---------159:56----------
tomorrow because I'm getting tired now

---------160:01----------
hmm oh wait what's that resistor there

---------160:06----------
look at that

---------160:08----------
is that a band mark or is that just a

---------160:14----------
hat lock or something what kind of looks

---------160:16----------
like a band mark to me

---------160:18----------
our 7005 should be a 20 I'm all right

---------160:31----------
see if we do in fact have a 20 on there

---------160:33----------
whether it's gone a little high no sadly

---------160:39----------
it is 20 ohms that's disappointing and

---------160:42----------
come with a good that is well

---------160:54----------
you're the current sense

---------161:08----------
which one of you you should be the tip

---------161:12----------
went to homes all around round trip to

---------161:15----------
point to that doesn't seem right do I

---------161:26----------
have the right one 7050 one that should

---------161:33----------
be 2.2 and you are twenty ohms so that

---------161:41----------
little bubble there oops that little

---------161:47----------
bubble there is a sign that it got a

---------161:52----------
little cooked so that maybe is why we've

---------161:54----------
got problems

---------162:00----------
never fine living in

---------162:20----------
we'll use a soldering iron to get this

---------162:22----------
one off because it is still in the

---------162:24----------
chassis that's going to sacrified it all

---------162:30----------
that all because I didn't bother to

---------162:32----------
check this first

---------162:53----------
whether if there's wandering this is

---------162:55----------
being streamed on a Linux machine

---------162:57----------
this is Ubuntu there are some

---------163:01----------
limitations compared to the Windows

---------163:03----------
version but mostly it's in the extra

---------163:09----------
filters and things aren't there

---------163:15----------
I have I read the right one there 70 51

---------163:20----------
it's definitely 2.2 ohms

---------163:28----------
hmm

---------163:35----------
I can actually confirm it because we can

---------163:37----------
just read it up there too

---------163:48----------
as let's unless two and a half which is

---------163:52----------
entirely normal

---------163:52----------
[Applause]

---------163:59----------
now no two and a half seems like it's

---------164:01----------
percentage-wise I was quite a bit bigger

---------164:03----------
than two point two but there's about a

---------164:06----------
point 3 ohm resistance in the leads and

---------164:12----------
the tips and things up there now

---------164:15----------
normally used to be able to zero that

---------164:16----------
out but for some reason I've noticed on

---------164:19----------
a lot of metres digital meters you can't

---------164:20----------
seem to zero it out now let's hope all

---------164:25----------
doesn't bunch up this thing because he's

---------164:27----------
put hot air in it

---------164:33----------
okay

---------164:48----------
well I guess we'd try that mouth

---------165:03----------
checking the note next to it I just

---------165:05----------
realized that I should do that

---------165:09----------
I'll be surprised if that one was there

---------165:11----------
because that is actually a zero ohm

---------165:12----------
resistor but you never know pushing

---------165:22----------
that's zero

---------165:26----------
a good point though good catch that

---------165:29----------
could easily have been something I

---------165:30----------
missed and that could cause me a whole

---------165:33----------
of drama

---------165:37----------
so appreciate that here we go again I

---------165:48----------
always grab the wrong lead yeah

---------165:56----------
now SDM Lewis is gonna be laughing his

---------166:01----------
guts out when he watches this later

---------166:03----------
it'd be like you absolutely idiot Paul

---------166:06----------
why didn't you check that first why

---------166:08----------
didn't you check the current sense first

---------166:10----------
a micro to accept thank you very much

---------166:18----------
for that I'm trying hard to produce

---------166:22----------
software that works for everybody I mean

---------166:24----------
after all I'll use it myself so it's in

---------166:27----------
my best interest for people not to see

---------166:30----------
my bald spot but yeah I try hard to keep

---------166:35----------
it relevant a lot of the features that

---------166:38----------
get out of it was simply because it's

---------166:40----------
been I'm using and I'll kind of go I

---------166:41----------
wish I had this and and goes from there

---------166:45----------
Linux can be a problem due to drivers

---------166:48----------
overall it's actually very good these

---------166:50----------
days but yeah certainly for exotic

---------166:52----------
devices it can be an absolute pain we

---------166:55----------
still have a crossed out battery here so

---------167:01----------
damn we're really having a rough time

---------167:04----------
with this

---------167:08----------
once the battery itself also got killed

---------167:11----------
that's possible and certainly not

---------167:16----------
