---------00:00----------
all right so today we're going to be

---------00:01----------
going over a MacBook Air board that is

---------00:03----------
dead

---------00:03----------
this was outsourced to me by some other

---------00:05----------
store and we're just going to try and

---------00:07----------
figure out what's wrong with it so this

---------00:09----------
is a little bit of liquid damage so

---------00:11----------
let's see if we can find a liquid damage

---------00:12----------
now usually other stores will clean the

---------00:14----------
board off but let's see if the same is

---------00:16----------
true with this one so we're gonna go

---------00:18----------
over and you tell me when you find the

---------00:21----------
liquid so first thing I got to do is get

---------00:23----------
the camera in focus here cuz it this is

---------00:25----------
very out of focus

---------00:27----------
Jason touch my camera man yeah but Jason

---------00:33----------
is my new scapegoat for everything do

---------00:36----------
you have somebody that you like to blame

---------00:37----------
for everything okay so here we go a

---------00:39----------
little bit of junk but this is around

---------00:41----------
the CPU area I really and that's that's

---------00:45----------
not important which nades right now it's

---------00:47----------
dead so 12 volts of the CPU is not the

---------00:49----------
most important thing huh hmm right by

---------00:54----------
the jtag connector we have something so

---------00:57----------
we're just going to continue down the

---------00:58----------
line here we have a little bit by the pp

---------01:00----------
3 V 4 2 circ this is for creating pp 3 V

---------01:03----------
4 2 to turn it around you let me know

---------01:13----------
and you see any liquid people through

---------01:16----------
your monitor yeah that's Sonny here with

---------01:23----------
us today

---------01:26----------
AHA and some liquid over here so I'm

---------01:30----------
going to start by just showing you that

---------01:33----------
this doesn't work MagSafe see dead now

---------01:43----------
we're going to do here you can remove

---------01:46----------
this little jtag connector so this is a

---------01:48----------
connector that allows you to I imagine

---------01:50----------
to program the BIOS and check several

---------01:53----------
voltages on the machine without actually

---------01:56----------
having a you know probe every single

---------01:58----------
individual point alright so we're going

---------02:00----------
to remove this

---------02:03----------
pre-heat the board

---------02:16----------
and let's answer the phone while

---------02:18----------
preheating the board how can I help you

---------02:33----------
well the thing is with the unresponsive

---------02:36----------
to touch that could be a touch I see on

---------02:38----------
the on the motherboard of the phone and

---------02:39----------
Apple is actually getting there's a

---------02:41----------
class-action lawsuit against them right

---------02:43----------
now so you end up waiting a week or two

---------02:44----------
you might actually be able to get that

---------02:46----------
fixed for free

---------02:52----------
you're welcome have a nice day there

---------02:57----------
were two calls at the same time the

---------02:58----------
other one is what requires looking up

---------03:00----------
status so there's no way in hell I'm

---------03:01----------
doing that while moving a connector so

---------03:08----------
we're going to remove the connector yeah

---------03:12----------
actually those resistors are worthless

---------03:13----------
is there going to the they're going

---------03:16----------
termination resistors on the jtag

---------03:17----------
connector right

---------03:40----------
every time I tell people that touch I

---------03:42----------
see is 200 bucks they lose their [ __ ]

---------03:44----------
mind but there's so much [ __ ] that can

---------03:45----------
go wrong while doing that yeah I'm not

---------03:50----------
gonna do what are you doing it for sunny

---------03:55----------
$85 to Jess's Desiree surprise from 150

---------04:04----------
to 200 you're doing right so what do you

---------04:07----------
do if like their flash doesn't work or

---------04:08----------
some [ __ ] like that when you're done or

---------04:10----------
no backlight the whole phone or just the

---------04:17----------
your Chinese guy works for pennies my

---------04:20----------
Chinese guy works for more than pennies

---------04:23----------
why do I have a Chinese guy that demands

---------04:25----------
real money but you have a Chinese guy

---------04:27----------
that works for almost free 289 that's

---------04:33----------
what I like to hear all right

---------04:48----------
Shazaam

---------04:51----------
um

---------04:53----------
okay now we have to eat problem number

---------04:56----------
one [ __ ] sob

---------04:57----------
alright now problem number two why are

---------05:00----------
you dead okay we're still not we're not

---------05:04----------
out of the woods yet sunny you got it

---------05:08----------
what the [ __ ] is this

---------05:19----------
let's see all right so now if we look

---------05:22----------
over to the schematic let's make a

---------05:25----------
little quieter we look over to the

---------05:27----------
schematic this is what we see so this is

---------05:31----------
what that little corroded piece is for

---------05:33----------
so it's supposed to take PP 3 V 3 sus in

---------05:35----------
and then give us PP 1 vo5 suss out so

---------05:39----------
let's just take some measurements and

---------05:40----------
see what we're getting so what I'm

---------05:41----------
interested in most uh first and foremost

---------05:43----------
here is what's on pin 1 are we getting

---------05:45----------
output

---------05:46----------
let's move the multimeter into view i-is

---------05:51----------
sustains suspendu [ __ ] nah I mean I

---------05:54----------
should know that it's embarrassing I

---------05:55----------
don't know that but I don't and so oh

---------05:57----------
well I I just I have no idea do you know

---------06:02----------
what it means

---------06:02----------
it's either suspend or what was the

---------06:07----------
first thing I said it was suspending

---------06:09----------
something else that I guessed suspend or

---------06:11----------
it can't be sleep this su it starts with

---------06:13----------
s us alright so on pin one I get one

---------06:21----------
point zero five

---------06:22----------
all right so even though this corrosion

---------06:23----------
over here it's not that hmm what could

---------06:29----------
it be we're missing something I know

---------06:32----------
that's corroded but I can't be I can't

---------06:34----------
care because it's not important so we're

---------06:39----------
all right let's see PP bus g3 hot is

---------06:43----------
obviously there PPV RTC g3 ah'd for the

---------06:50----------
clock is there hmm pp 5vs5 it's there is

---------07:02----------
p.m. sleep s for all the one that's

---------07:04----------
missing please don't tell me p.m. sleep

---------07:06----------
s4l is missing I hate when that one's

---------07:08----------
missing I know it's such a [ __ ] piece

---------07:12----------
of [ __ ] I hate it ok it's where are you

---------07:20----------
I should know where this is because I I

---------07:23----------
always look it up and want to cry

---------07:28----------
p.m. sleep as for Ella's you mother

---------07:31----------
[ __ ] piece yeah [ __ ] you

---------07:35----------
Hey p.m. sleep s4l why do you do this to

---------07:39----------
me why huh okay let's yeah is SMC reset

---------07:51----------
there

---------07:58----------
it's SMC reset present yes you are

---------08:05----------
I bet the ultrasonic will fix this it

---------08:10----------
has this random corrosion and these

---------08:11----------
random areas that it is makes me wonder

---------08:17----------
wait a second somebody [ __ ] with this

---------08:20----------
did you [ __ ] with this yeah you did you

---------08:24----------
[ __ ] with this look at this what the why

---------08:26----------
what is this what the [ __ ] is this what

---------08:32----------
[ __ ] the corrosion near the CPU what is

---------08:35----------
this what did you replace ah this look

---------08:41----------
it was soldered before poorly soldered

---------08:45----------
before this doesn't matter this is this

---------08:47----------
is it this is [ __ ] irrelevant oh it's

---------08:49----------
not even this is pp bus g3 hot it's not

---------08:53----------
people it's pp bus g3 hot after a

---------08:55----------
current sensing resistor so if this was

---------08:58----------
short it's a ground that nothing else

---------08:59----------
would even work so there that's [ __ ]

---------09:01----------
irrelevant now it doesn't mean that

---------09:02----------
something could have gotten to the CPU

---------09:03----------
but my ultrasonic is not hot enough yet

---------09:07----------
to clean that so what what is this what

---------09:10----------
does this thing do and why the [ __ ] did

---------09:12----------
you touch a head ah yeah why the [ __ ]

---------09:22----------
you soldering [ __ ] before you even

---------09:23----------
[ __ ] alright so this is for a

---------09:26----------
DDR which is an s3 rail which I don't

---------09:29----------
care about because I don't even have PP

---------09:30----------
p.m. sleep s4 Elliot but I don't

---------09:34----------
understand why would you why would you

---------09:35----------
replace something when you still of the

---------09:37----------
corrosion all over the board you don't

---------09:39----------
even have a green light yeah they're

---------09:41----------
just that [ __ ] good maybe they were

---------09:43----------
maybe they were thinking ahead of me

---------09:44----------
maybe they knew they knew something we

---------09:45----------
both don't know Sonny I don't this kills

---------09:49----------
me this came from a [ __ ] store

---------09:56----------
why okay q 74 30

---------10:05----------
q 74 30 so you're the two MOSFETs for

---------10:10----------
creation of P P 1 V 2 underscore s 3

---------10:18----------
this is this is this can't this is odd

---------10:21----------
ah so PP 5vs5 it turns into P P 1 V 2 s

---------10:26----------
3 yeah so this is Q 74 30 the thing that

---------10:35----------
was [ __ ] with kind of that wondering

---------10:38----------
if an ultrasonic will do it I have a

---------10:40----------
feeling after I ultrasonic it's not

---------10:41----------
going to have P P 1 V 2 s 3 comma nuts

---------10:43----------
but hmm let's see if we flex around some

---------10:49----------
of these parts and hot air if we get

---------10:51----------
anything

---------11:07----------
stuff to worry about is that if the 3.3

---------11:10----------
volts went were 1.5 volts is supposed to

---------11:12----------
go that's no good because of that nasty

---------11:14----------
regulator on the other side of the board

---------11:29----------
you really do touch I see for 89 bucks

---------11:32----------
honey I can't believe you

---------12:07----------
I'm getting solder on the coil then

---------12:29----------
whoa I wish that was on camera this

---------12:34----------
thing is that this did this yeah but

---------12:36----------
it's that it's in the microscope you

---------12:38----------
didn't see that the JBC just attacked

---------12:40----------
sunny you know the thing always falls

---------12:42----------
out I think I showed you in one of the

---------12:43----------
earlier videos maybe a few days ago or

---------12:46----------
last week but the JBC just attacked

---------12:49----------
sunny because he's sitting right in

---------12:51----------
front of it that's exactly what you want

---------12:53----------
450 Celsius of hot air on your dick that

---------12:57----------
that's that's a great way to start your

---------12:58----------
Sunday afternoon right

---------13:14----------
all right soon to be ultra sonicing time

---------13:16----------
cool that off I can't because I broke it

---------13:20----------
at a frustration from it constantly

---------13:22----------
falling

---------13:32----------
okay so I wonder if it's supposed to

---------13:37----------
turn on by itself I'm also wondering how

---------13:38----------
important are those two resistors that I

---------13:40----------
removed thinking they're not important

---------13:42----------
without looking them up that would be

---------13:44----------
funny if they are important let's see

---------13:48----------
what did you removed um them right our

---------13:52----------
sixty one twenty seven and our sixty one

---------13:54----------
twenty two

---------13:54----------
our sixty one two - yeah but that's

---------13:59----------
going between I think that's going to

---------14:02----------
the to the connector wait no it's not

---------14:05----------
that that that's not going to the

---------14:07----------
connector that's going straight to the

---------14:09----------
you mama [ __ ] it alright so I

---------14:12----------
actually did fix it by just removing the

---------14:14----------
connect why did I take those yeah we got

---------14:19----------
to cut all that out we got to edit that

---------14:20----------
son you're gonna it's called YouTube

---------14:23----------
magic we're going to make so this this

---------14:27----------
board really just needed for me to

---------14:29----------
remove the connector let's see I why

---------14:34----------
would you replace the transistor

---------14:35----------
required for DDR before removing the

---------14:38----------
corrosion that's on the connector that

---------14:40----------
gets used for everything I thought these

---------14:45----------
were going straight to the connector my

---------14:47----------
bad

---------14:48----------
that is dumb but still I'll still put

---------14:53----------
that ahead of not removing the damn

---------14:55----------
corrosion

---------14:59----------
duh

---------15:14----------
89 bucks for touch I see sunny

---------15:33----------
yeah so this was literally fixed by

---------15:35----------
removing the connector

---------15:45----------
this was fixed by removing the [ __ ]

---------15:47----------
connector huh let's plug it in so you

---------15:50----------
can see the fan permanently spin yeah

---------15:59----------
yeah he fixed the DDR circuit and he

---------16:02----------
left he left the corrosion on so it made

---------16:05----------
for a decent video after he did all the

---------16:09----------
heavy lifting there's still pain oh well

---------16:20----------
let's go over why that connector is so

---------16:22----------
important you have PP 3 V 4 2 which is

---------16:28----------
the power required for the SMC

---------16:30----------
and the 1 wire circuit oh you have PP 5

---------16:33----------
vs o required for everything you have

---------16:36----------
the BIOS you have the SMC reset signals

---------16:38----------
you have the SMC mode signals everything

---------16:41----------
that's important is right here so if you

---------16:44----------
were to drop water on any single part

---------16:46----------
this is the worst because like think

---------16:49----------
about electing stab like if you get

---------16:50----------
stabbed in the arm out but you'll still

---------16:52----------
be alive you get stabbed in the knee

---------16:54----------
okay you can't walk but you're still

---------16:55----------
alive if you wanted to kill somebody and

---------16:57----------
you wanted to [ __ ] them up in the worst

---------16:58----------
possible way like you stabbed them in

---------17:00----------
the brain because there's nowhere in the

---------17:02----------
brain where you can just get stabbed and

---------17:03----------
Bo lets thing like let's do complex

---------17:06----------
physics today it's just your use you're

---------17:08----------
screwed this is pretty much every single

---------17:11----------
important part of the machine in this

---------17:13----------
tiny little spot so when you get

---------17:14----------
something on there it screws everything

---------17:17----------
up and there are so many people and I

---------17:18----------
used to have somebody who worked you

---------17:19----------
that if you saw corrosion there we go oh

---------17:21----------
well that can't be at the thought that's

---------17:22----------
just that that doesn't go to anything

---------17:24----------
nothing even plugs into there everything

---------17:26----------
plugs into there so it's something to

---------17:28----------
think about because this person's paying

---------17:30----------
225 bucks for me to remove a connector

---------17:33----------
and yeah

---------17:36----------
well I'm not gonna reattach it would you

---------17:39----------
reattach it I'm gonna alter sonicate

---------17:43----------
okay you know I'm not gonna be a total

---------17:45----------
dick partial what would you do Sonny

---------17:50----------
Sonny would charge 87 bucks for it

---------17:55----------
I didn't know 87 for a touch I see yeah

---------17:59----------
like 12 minutes all right

---------18:02----------
taking the phone why I don't even get

---------18:07----------
that message you should lower your price

---------18:12----------
to 30 how much do you pay this Chinese

---------18:15----------
guy semi is it an amount that if you set

---------18:19----------
it on camera that you would get arrested

---------18:21----------
I'm paying him why he's happy so what do

---------18:28----------
you think Jason would be happy with but

---------18:34----------
what do you think like if you wanted to

---------18:37----------
like move closer to the simple Mack

---------18:40----------
model but what I need to make him happy

---------18:49----------
I'll put a sign up that says 80 $80

---------18:51----------
touch ICS will compete my Chinese person

---------18:55----------
versus your Chinese person the cheaper

---------19:01----------
ones like 250 bucks this one $700 you

---------19:04----------
don't need that absolutely and that's it

---------19:11----------
for today and as always I hope you

---------19:13----------
learned something
