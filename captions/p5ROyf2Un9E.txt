---------00:00----------
how's it going everybody so today we're

---------00:01----------
gonna be working on an a 1932 MacBook

---------00:03----------
Air that doesn't appear to be turning on

---------00:05----------
this is where the newest MacBook Air it

---------00:06----------
is one of Paul's favorite and we're

---------00:08----------
gonna see if we can make it work again

---------00:09----------
so let's turn on money overhead camera

---------00:12----------
lights so that we can see what's going

---------00:14----------
on on the desk over here my beautiful

---------00:17----------
lovely clean desk this cover comes off a

---------00:22----------
lot easier no finger bending or cutting

---------00:25----------
all right now as you can see we have

---------00:28----------
corrosion on the board this is actually

---------00:30----------
something that makes me happy I'm never

---------00:32----------
gonna forget the one time that Paul

---------00:33----------
opened this board that he got it was in

---------00:35----------
a 1989 and he was looking at it and

---------00:37----------
saying please don't be disgusting please

---------00:40----------
don't be disgusting please don't be

---------00:41----------
disgusting and that he sees that there's

---------00:43----------
no corrosion whatsoever anywhere on the

---------00:44----------
board and what did you start saying what

---------00:49----------
why don't you want it to be clean if

---------00:53----------
it's clean there's no hints which means

---------00:56----------
T to chip T to ship getting mildly warm

---------01:00----------
and that's it so I'm actually quite

---------01:01----------
happy that we have some hints here so

---------01:02----------
we're just gonna take the board out of

---------01:04----------
the Machine and get started see what's

---------01:06----------
what it's doing his little mouse still

---------01:08----------
around no he's gone three of his friends

---------01:11----------
however made it in today two of them so

---------01:15----------
that sealed their fate and the

---------01:17----------
mousetraps and one of them was just

---------01:18----------
sitting in the Garbage Pail eating

---------01:21----------
Hannah and Camille's Dorito crumbs which

---------01:23----------
are not gonna be in the garbage anymore

---------01:24----------
after we leave given the fact that I

---------01:26----------
thought there's one Mouse but there's

---------01:28----------
actually about four mice it is about

---------01:30----------
time to take out the big guns and bring

---------01:32----------
in the Oreo all right so it looks like

---------01:33----------
we have two issues here the first is

---------01:35----------
corrosion on the charge port which we're

---------01:38----------
just gonna scrape away here and the next

---------01:42----------
is we have some corrosion over here what

---------01:47----------
I imagine RPP bus g3 hot caps right next

---------01:49----------
to the speaker output but let's just see

---------01:51----------
if that is the case I'm gonna open up a

---------01:54----------
board here for the eina board view for

---------01:56----------
the a 1932 this board is an eight to

---------02:03----------
zero - zero one five to one

---------02:05----------
and those two caps that have a lot of

---------02:08----------
corrosion on them are DPP Bosch d3 hot

---------02:10----------
so proper guests so my guess is that I

---------02:12----------
likely had a short that

---------02:13----------
being caused by that arcing corrosion

---------02:15----------
that since I removed it with my q-tip

---------02:17----------
right now it's good but let's just see

---------02:19----------
if that's the case I'm going to turn on

---------02:20----------
the Paul Daniel software get the meter

---------02:22----------
on the screen okay so we have five ohms

---------02:28----------
short two grounds on PP brush d3 hot so

---------02:31----------
5 ohms the ground on the main power line

---------02:33----------
for the batter that charges the battery

---------02:35----------
and is also responsible to the entire

---------02:36----------
machine is no good so I'm gonna take my

---------02:38----------
soldering iron over here and this is one

---------02:41----------
of those short circuits where I don't

---------02:42----------
need to use a thermal camera because

---------02:44----------
it's really obvious what it is that's

---------02:46----------
causing it

---------03:05----------
Kevin I'm gonna block for you give me

---------03:08----------
the way this is not is this clickety

---------03:10----------
clackety is back yes yes clickety

---------03:13----------
clackety see this keyboard I'm like this

---------03:16----------
this geniux up my whole desk I can't I

---------03:18----------
can't bring this over I can't bring the

---------03:21----------
board back I can't do anything because

---------03:23----------
of it but this keyboard mister clickety

---------03:25----------
clackety I missed you little clickety

---------03:29----------
clackety I don't know why I ever got rid

---------03:32----------
of you

---------03:33----------
you're my favorite keyboard and now

---------03:35----------
there's three Mouse mice in the store

---------03:37----------
today so the mouse that we found is not

---------03:40----------
it there's more

---------03:58----------
now let's get rid of that nasty solder

---------04:00----------
blob that I probably just kind of

---------04:02----------
flicked off but now I'm stupidly wicking

---------04:04----------
watch good week erase my mistake as if

---------04:07----------
it never happened

---------04:15----------
that little cap that slid out of place

---------04:18----------
before is gonna come back into place

---------04:19----------
nicely yeah honestly I could have made

---------04:23----------
this entire job much easier by simply

---------04:25----------
using hot air from the beginning I was

---------04:27----------
just trying to minimize the hot air that

---------04:29----------
I put on this board because this board

---------04:31----------
is smaller than the other boards there's

---------04:33----------
a lot more you know BGA stuff SS

---------04:36----------
under-filled SSD is under-filled ram and

---------04:39----------
it is also the connector right next door

---------04:42----------
so the less heat that I use on this

---------04:45----------
thing the better but as you saw that

---------04:48----------
unfortunately it's not always possible

---------05:16----------
who does the procurement of donor boards

---------05:18----------
I do you plan on offering dusted a job

---------05:21----------
after he graduates when Doster graduates

---------05:23----------
he's gonna become some sort of designer

---------05:26----------
or something he's not gonna want to work

---------05:29----------
here fixing boards at the common folk

---------05:31----------
das dudes are gonna be what they owe

---------05:34----------
Dustin's gonna be the bourgeoisie he's

---------05:41----------
gonna become an engineer at Apple

---------05:42----------
probably yeah that's what I see das

---------05:45----------
we're doing

---------05:52----------
making those programmable chips that

---------05:56----------
died a few

---------06:04----------
it's

---------06:07----------
dust is gonna make those programmable

---------06:09----------
chips that if you try to read the firmer

---------06:11----------
off of them it just kills itself see das

---------06:15----------
dude knows his [ __ ] so when he testifies

---------06:17----------
against Wright to repair I'm gonna have

---------06:19----------
to come up with a much better ammo no

---------06:24----------
I'm kidding

---------06:32----------
now I'm gonna do something I shouldn't

---------06:34----------
do again which is be a perfectionist I

---------06:38----------
want to have and it's not good enough

---------06:40----------
that it's soldered on the board I want

---------06:42----------
it to be prettily soldered on the board

---------06:47----------
can't leave well enough alone yep and

---------06:51----------
you see what happens when I do that

---------07:08----------
that it really wants the short you know

---------07:11----------
what's really lame as those two paths

---------07:13----------
that are next to each other I thought

---------07:14----------
since these are both pp bus caps that

---------07:16----------
would be pp bunch G three hot and that

---------07:18----------
the point that keeps wanting the touch

---------07:19----------
but it's not that's actually ground on

---------07:22----------
one end and pp bus on the other that's

---------07:24----------
really shitty ok cities not sure what he

---------07:27----------
will be doing so working for the man may

---------07:29----------
not be in his plans we'll see yeah F das

---------07:32----------
dude wanted to work here I'd be honored

---------07:33----------
but again he lives in a civilized part

---------07:37----------
of the United States not you know where

---------07:40----------
housing is affordable and people are

---------07:42----------
nice and the streets aren't polluted and

---------07:45----------
people are honest yeah like why would

---------07:49----------
you want to leave that to come to this

---------07:50----------
[ __ ] you know yeah it's funny when

---------07:55----------
people say I would love to come to New

---------07:57----------
York to where if you have no idea even

---------07:59----------
if you only pay me even if I'll get the

---------08:02----------
same money I get at my current job it's

---------08:03----------
thought you don't understand if you get

---------08:05----------
paid the same money that you get paid in

---------08:06----------
your current job to be in New York City

---------08:08----------
you're you're poor if you're in Texas or

---------08:12----------
Mississippi or Kansas or South Dakota or

---------08:15----------
Virginia and you think you're making a

---------08:17----------
decent living and you're like I don't

---------08:18----------
even mind if I don't get a raise I want

---------08:20----------
to come work for Louis if you work for

---------08:22----------
Louis at the salary you're getting

---------08:23----------
whatever you are right now you're

---------08:24----------
probably going to be poor I'm so

---------08:26----------
confident myself I'm not even gonna

---------08:27----------
check if the shorts gone before I plug

---------08:29----------
it in famous last words

---------08:30----------
I'm sure it'll work just fine if this

---------08:33----------
doesn't get fan spin then I'll be pretty

---------08:38----------
pretty surprised so what do you all

---------08:42----------
think you think I'm gonna get some fan

---------08:43----------
spin Paul

---------08:48----------
Paul Paul he doesn't know MacBooks it's

---------08:54----------
okay Paul thinks there's no fan on in

---------08:59----------
1932 just because the fan is not coupled

---------09:02----------
to the heatsink does not mean that

---------09:03----------
there's no fan just because the fan

---------09:09----------
serves no purpose

---------09:10----------
this would be

---------09:23----------
yeah let's see what we get so it looks

---------09:26----------
like five volts

---------09:28----------
21 June milliamps 20 volts 70 milliamps

---------09:34----------
Open Sesame mofo alright cool

---------09:39----------
are you booting

---------09:46----------
we have an Apple logo I didn't plug in

---------09:48----------
the fence that we don't have the fan

---------09:49----------
spinning but as you can see this MacBook

---------09:51----------
does work again so it looks like it was

---------09:53----------
had a bunch of corrosion right by the

---------09:56----------
speaker connector it's a very common

---------09:57----------
area for corrosion again on the year

---------09:59----------
1932 and there were two capacitors they

---------10:01----------
had corrosion on them for PBS g3 huh I

---------10:03----------
measured two resistance to ground I'll

---------10:05----------
pick the best g3 huh and it was around

---------10:07----------
zero to four ohms that is not proper so

---------10:10----------
I went to remove them now at first I

---------10:13----------
tried to remove them properly by using

---------10:16----------
the iron because you have to understand

---------10:19----------
the reason I did that is because there

---------10:20----------
are chips some nice BGA chips over here

---------10:23----------
I forget if this is the RAM of the SS

---------10:25----------
that that's the SSD because it says

---------10:27----------
SanDisk on it so right next to those

---------10:29----------
caps is under-filled under-filled

---------10:32----------
SSD so you have to understand even if

---------10:34----------
you think it's stupid that I went ahead

---------10:35----------
and tried to remove those caps using the

---------10:38----------
soldering iron instead of using hot air

---------10:40----------
that there's a good reason for it I was

---------10:42----------
trying to preserve the customers data

---------10:43----------
obviously I was able to preserve it with

---------10:46----------
the hot air because it booted up and you

---------10:47----------
could see that if you know show their

---------10:49----------
name and everything but you always want

---------10:50----------
to take precautions whenever you're

---------10:52----------
using hot air right around under-filled

---------10:55----------
nand or anything like that because that

---------10:56----------
that's gonna be a complete another

---------10:57----------
nightmare to work on and it's always

---------10:59----------
important to try and lower your risk and

---------11:01----------
perhaps I'll find that that area the

---------11:02----------
board is very heavily heatsink you may

---------11:04----------
have noticed that even when every time I

---------11:06----------
would tin the pads it would immediately

---------11:08----------
would dry almost immediately that's why

---------11:10----------
I was drying and they're very kind of

---------11:11----------
unclean gravelly state that it usually

---------11:14----------
dries in when the solder does not have

---------11:16----------
enough flux or I haven't done it

---------11:17----------
properly but we wonder managed using the

---------11:20----------
hot air to do that

---------11:21----------
the short is obviously gone since it's

---------11:22----------
booting and that's it I have an easy a

---------11:24----------
1932 no power and I don't know what Paul

---------11:27----------
is complaining about when it comes to

---------11:28----------
these new machines because it seems like

---------11:29----------
they're just all easy breezy beautiful

---------11:30----------
covergirl just remember it's not lying

---------11:32----------
it's commercial real estate again I

---------11:34----------
usually don't chill mugs t-shirts all

---------11:36----------
that kind of stuff but I would like a

---------11:38----------
straight floor and that's it for today

---------11:41----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------11:43----------
something see you in the next video
