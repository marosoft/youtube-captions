---------00:00----------
all right so today we're going to fix a

---------00:01----------
MacBook with no backlight by replacing

---------00:03----------
the coil so let me just go over how you

---------00:06----------
can see that the coil is what's wrong

---------00:07----------
with this here we have sunny and Mark

---------00:09----------
from practical board repair school so

---------00:11----------
this is a MacBook Air screen that I use

---------00:13----------
for testing it looks like which is

---------00:15----------
why it gets used for testing we're gonna

---------00:17----------
plug it in now a couple of quick

---------00:24----------
measurements here with the multimeter

---------00:26----------
where can you actually see the

---------00:28----------
multimeter all right barely but what the

---------00:30----------
hell so on backlight output diode mode

---------00:34----------
measurement to ground there is no short

---------00:37----------
0.5 to 3 on the either side of the coil

---------00:41----------
a 0.392

---------00:42----------
and point four five four one five now

---------00:47----------
when we turn it on we're gonna go back

---------00:53----------
to voltage mode wait for the screen to

---------01:00----------
activate

---------01:07----------
come on you little turn off okay on

---------01:13----------
one side of the coil we have 8.54 volts

---------01:16----------
and on the other side of the coil

---------01:18----------
we have 0.2 volts and since there's no

---------01:20----------
short that means that the coil is

---------01:22----------
probably bad so we get the hot air

---------01:24----------
station on wait for it to heat up and we

---------01:28----------
replace the coil and there's a good

---------01:30----------
chance that once we replace the

---------01:31----------
backlight coil which does all the

---------01:32----------
backlight boosting that will have a

---------01:35----------
backlight mark do you have your t-shirt

---------01:44----------
it's never the coil except for when it

---------01:46----------
is if I say the password to my front

---------01:54----------
desk computer on a YouTube video a bunch

---------01:57----------
of kids from 4chan are going to find my

---------01:59----------
IP and hack it come on hack o it up

---------02:04----------
faster you come on if you have the

---------02:11----------
air below 10 on this piece of crap and

---------02:12----------
they eat up it just decides to die for a

---------02:14----------
long period of time like I can't even

---------02:17----------
burn myself with this now and it's yeah

---------02:21----------
it's 1,500 bucks I want it I want one

---------02:25----------
I'll take one if JBC wants to giving it

---------02:28----------
to give it to me I am known for my

---------02:31----------
positive endorsements of people who send

---------02:34----------
me stuff for free maybe not maybe Oh for

---------02:41----------
[ __ ] sake here we go

---------02:43----------
okay time to heat up that coil now there

---------02:46----------
was a little bit of corrosion by the

---------02:48----------
coil so I decided to go over that

---------02:50----------
nastily with solder

---------03:14----------
now the bottom is leaded solder is the

---------03:16----------
top is lead-free solder so you can get a

---------03:17----------
good idea of how how much more difficult

---------03:20----------
it is to melt one versus the other

---------03:26----------
Wow it really really is the coil so

---------03:30----------
check it out a piece of the coil is

---------03:32----------
stuck on the motherboard see that see

---------03:35----------
this right over here that is coil and

---------03:39----------
that is yeah okay

---------03:51----------
yep

---------03:53----------
one

---------04:06----------
oh no the board that I wanted to steal

---------04:08----------
the coil from is missing the coil

---------04:10----------
somebody else must have used that to fix

---------04:13----------
another board that had also had a bad

---------04:14----------
backlight coil this must be an epidemic

---------04:19----------
here this one has a coil thank God I'm

---------04:24----------
gonna go back to removing the coils

---------04:29----------
Jesse Jones that iPad rehab would be so

---------04:32----------
happy that we learned so much from her

---------04:33----------
course that the I didn't even have to do

---------04:36----------
any desta mating you know we just

---------04:38----------
checked the first thing that it set the

---------04:39----------
check on the slide and the presentation

---------04:47----------
go air filter go-go-gadget air filter

---------04:51----------
come back

---------04:56----------
Oh

---------05:01----------
never breathe that

---------05:15----------
I have to check and make sure this is

---------05:16----------
recording it would be a crime if

---------05:20----------
this were not recording excellent it is

---------05:21----------
I don't trust the computer alright go

---------05:27----------
back here

---------05:33----------
let's try to melt the solder on the

---------05:35----------
board before we place the coil so make

---------05:39----------
life easier

---------05:53----------
I'm using the wrong tip for this because

---------05:56----------
my tips were in my luggage actually and

---------05:58----------
I don't even have a grip right now I'm

---------05:59----------
using this as a soldering iron not

---------06:01----------
exactly the best thing in the world

---------06:03----------
let's see what it can do I notice I have

---------06:07----------
a lot more accuracy when I'm using a

---------06:08----------
grip that when I don't have a grip Wow

---------06:15----------
well good enough for rock and roll

---------06:58----------
that shirt doesn't say a thing about

---------07:00----------
this claimers it doesn't say it's never

---------07:02----------
except for that one percent of the time

---------07:04----------
that it is never means never you know

---------07:06----------
your parents always said they don't

---------07:08----------
never never say never but in that case

---------07:12----------
never actually met never okay what the

---------07:25----------
 yeah so now I need feedback as well

---------07:31----------
at least I'm up to eight that's good

---------07:43----------
okay so we've graduated a little bit

---------07:47----------
whoops it's no plug there

---------07:56----------
Oh doesn't mean it wasn't the coil they

---------08:04----------
were just a coil in addition to some

---------08:06----------
other things yeah that's a good idea

---------08:17----------
let's see where's my feedback via I

---------08:23----------
didn't put it there properly most likely

---------08:26----------
yep it's clearly not even touching

---------08:28----------
that's a joke

---------08:30----------
that isn't that my that is some

---------08:32----------
soldering right there that is some

---------08:35----------
and balls soldering right there okay so

---------08:39----------
now what I need here is the curvy tip

---------08:41----------
which I hope to god was not left in

---------08:44----------
Victor New York ok please give me if

---------08:54----------
Sonny didn't pack it he's paying for

---------08:55----------
dinner I feel like that's very fair

---------09:24----------
 I'm paying for dinner okay

---------09:38----------
it is this is how do you feel about this

---------09:41----------
whole articulating stand mark why

---------09:47----------
look at look at this thing to himself

---------09:49----------
look what it does oh oh dude you're a

---------09:58----------
genius you did that works

---------10:06----------
8:40

---------10:15----------
okay feedback is there it was the coil

---------10:22----------
and the feedback we had 0.2 volts over

---------10:25----------
there before I really was hoping that

---------10:29----------
this would be one over was just a coil

---------10:31----------
because that would have been funny that

---------10:45----------
only fits on the Excel version

---------11:04----------
hey this one turns on and turns off and

---------11:07----------
turns on and turns off turns on and

---------11:08----------
turns off and mofo oh I didn't put

---------11:13----------
the latch on hideout and the Jesus does

---------11:18----------
light up in the back I should edit that

---------11:21----------
because that identifies the customer one

---------11:26----------
time it was the coy yeah definitely make

---------11:34----------
sure the coil is good cuz it frequently

---------11:36----------
goes bad you'll have to use the coil

---------11:37----------
setting on your multimeter they don't

---------11:39----------
have that on the fluke 15b they only

---------11:41----------
have that on the higher-end models yeah

---------11:44----------
yeah definitely yeah I think that maybe

---------11:47----------
the $40,000 agilent analyzer
