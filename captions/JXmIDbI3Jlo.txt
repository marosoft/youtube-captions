---------00:02----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:04----------
we're gonna be working on an e 1707

---------00:06----------
MacBook Pro that has no power this is a

---------00:08----------
15-inch MacBook Pro touch bar that was

---------00:09----------
produced between 2016 and 2017 let's see

---------00:12----------
if we can figure out why this Mac Pro

---------00:14----------
has no power and make it work again the

---------00:15----------
first thing we have to do here is open

---------00:16----------
this MacBook up let's get put on the

---------00:18----------
table flip it over have it on the desk

---------00:20----------
get our pentalobe screwdriver because

---------00:22----------
Apple wouldn't be Apple if they didn't

---------00:23----------
have a proprietary screw required to

---------00:25----------
open the bottom of the machine I don't

---------00:28----------
know if I should say proprietary perhaps

---------00:30----------
rare

---------00:30----------
I haven't actually confirmed whether

---------00:32----------
these pendulums are specifically

---------00:33----------
proprietary to Apple or rare either way

---------00:35----------
kind of a dick move given that a Torx t3

---------00:39----------
would have been just fine for these

---------00:40----------
bottom screws but rather than that they

---------00:42----------
chose to go with this thing that you

---------00:43----------
can't get in any hardware store so that

---------00:45----------
if you actually managed to spill liquid

---------00:46----------
on your machine you can't unplug the

---------00:47----------
battery in time for it to not kill

---------00:48----------
everything on your machine so the whole

---------00:50----------
thing with liquid damages you want to

---------00:52----------
make sure that there's no power going in

---------00:53----------
the machine so you want to unplug power

---------00:54----------
to it as soon as you can so that when

---------00:56----------
you do decide to get a treat you don't

---------00:58----------
have that continuous decay that will

---------01:01----------
have occurred and with these products by

---------01:03----------
the time your screwdriver comes in the

---------01:05----------
mail your batteries already been plugged

---------01:06----------
in for probably 2 to 4 days and at that

---------01:08----------
point they're kind of already screwed

---------01:09----------
but that's Apple so let's I just had a

---------01:14----------
rubber band shot of me

---------01:19----------
[Music]

---------01:27----------
[Music]

---------01:30----------
it looks like we're going at 20 volts

---------01:32----------
but a zero point zero two amps see that

---------01:35----------
20 volts with zero point zero 2 amps

---------01:37----------
that's 20 milliamps so we're getting to

---------01:39----------
20 volts which means the cd32 15s are

---------01:41----------
speaking to the charger and telling it

---------01:43----------
I'm a Macbook I'm not a GoPro or a phone

---------01:45----------
give me 20 volts not 5

---------01:47----------
that also means PP 3 P 3 undersquare g3

---------01:49----------
has got to be there but we are stuck at

---------01:51----------
20 milliamps which means this is not

---------01:53----------
turning on so the first thing I'm gonna

---------01:55----------
want to do here is turn on Paul Daniels

---------01:57----------
is amazingly beautiful multimeter

---------01:58----------
software you can ask Paul Daniels for

---------02:02----------
this type of software by going to PL

---------02:03----------
Daniel's calm or following his YouTube

---------02:06----------
channel at youtube.com slash 19 p LD 73

---------02:10----------
that's 19 p LD 73 P P bus g3 hot is a

---------02:19----------
15.6 ohm short to ground now why did I

---------02:24----------
just measure that spot well it's a great

---------02:25----------
question and you may not be exactly sure

---------02:28----------
why measured that spot let's open up a

---------02:31----------
schematic for an e2 0-0 0 to 8 1 board

---------02:35----------
schematics are gonna have to find online

---------02:37----------
on your own the software to you to read

---------02:39----------
them with you can find it PL Daniels

---------02:40----------
comm don't delay check out Paul Daniels

---------02:44----------
a software but going to PL Daniels comm

---------02:46----------
today that's PL Daniels dot-com PL

---------02:49----------
Daniel's dot-com in this list when you

---------02:52----------
first thing is when you don't have a

---------02:54----------
power rail first thing you do is if you

---------02:57----------
have a no power situation likely one of

---------02:58----------
the power rails and the machine is

---------03:00----------
missing so you know how on a desktop PC

---------03:02----------
when you see those molex connectors or

---------03:03----------
stuff going from the powers apply to the

---------03:05----------
components when you're building a PC

---------03:06----------
you've got the yellow wire the you'll

---------03:09----------
see if yellow wire you have the red wire

---------03:10----------
and I believe the yellow is gonna be 12

---------03:12----------
volts the red wire is gonna be 5 volts

---------03:15----------
you have different power rails in the

---------03:16----------
desktop and the same thing is true for a

---------03:18----------
laptop so on a laptop of him getting no

---------03:20----------
power what I like to do is I like to

---------03:21----------
check the power rails and the power

---------03:22----------
rails used to be listed in the beginning

---------03:24----------
of the schematic on the diagram on page

---------03:26----------
3 and also on page 6 now because Apple

---------03:28----------
the most important part of the system is

---------03:30----------
going to be listed on page 107 or 109

---------03:33----------
because again Apple so we scroll over to

---------03:35----------
page 109 and we have a list of rails so

---------03:38----------
the different rails are going to come on

---------03:39----------
at different times

---------03:40----------
g3 hot rails are always on as for rails

---------03:43----------
are on when the machine

---------03:44----------
is hibernating as three rails of arm

---------03:45----------
when the machine is sleeping as a rails

---------03:47----------
are on when it's on so for example the

---------03:49----------
g3 hot rail that's let's say the power

---------03:51----------
to charge the battery because you want

---------03:52----------
your computer to be powering the battery

---------03:54----------
regardless of what it's doing always

---------03:55----------
charge the battery s4 hibernate only

---------03:58----------
have this rail be online machine is

---------04:00----------
hibernating so you don't want the

---------04:01----------
keyboard of the trackpad to be taking

---------04:03----------
power when the computers off right it's

---------04:05----------
a waste of electricity but you want it

---------04:07----------
to be on someone when the machine is

---------04:10----------
hibernating so that you can hit the

---------04:11----------
keyboard or the trackpad and wake it

---------04:13----------
from hibernation it's not going to know

---------04:15----------
to be woke from hibernation if it's not

---------04:17----------
getting power as three-rail is gonna be

---------04:19----------
something like memory you don't want

---------04:20----------
that to be on when the computers off but

---------04:22----------
you also don't want that to only be on

---------04:23----------
when the computers on because when you

---------04:25----------
put the computer to sleep

---------04:26----------
that's suspend the CPU doesn't have to

---------04:28----------
be on the screen doesn't have to be on

---------04:29----------
the fan doesn't be F that be on but the

---------04:31----------
memory has to be on so that whatever you

---------04:33----------
had going on your desktop or the

---------04:36----------
programs you had open stay open because

---------04:37----------
they were suspended to memory and the

---------04:39----------
next is the s over L that's the rails

---------04:40----------
when the machine is always on so think

---------04:42----------
of it like a little pyramid so you have

---------04:44----------
g3 hot as 5 s 4 s 3 is up and I checked

---------04:48----------
the first G 3 hot rail that was on this

---------04:50----------
list here P P bus G 3 hot now when I

---------04:53----------
right-click on PP XG 3 hot it will show

---------04:55----------
me everywhere in the schematic that it

---------04:56----------
shows up and I can see that it shows up

---------04:58----------
right over here that's where I measure

---------04:59----------
with the multimeter and it also says

---------05:01----------
over here voltage 13 point one volts so

---------05:04----------
I know what I'm supposed to get there

---------05:05----------
and obviously I'm not gonna be getting

---------05:06----------
anything because when I check over here

---------05:08----------
with my multimeter I get 16 ohms to

---------05:14----------
ground which means that there is a short

---------05:15----------
circuit to ground now in the document

---------05:17----------
that I have listed down below in all the

---------05:18----------
videos there is a guide that tells you

---------05:20----------
if you're not getting the power rail

---------05:22----------
these are expecting to get why what are

---------05:25----------
the causes it could be that the enable

---------05:27----------
is not present on the chip that makes it

---------05:29----------
just like a light switch you know the

---------05:30----------
light switch has to be flipped on for

---------05:33----------
the light to work I'm not gonna blame

---------05:34----------
the electrical in the store I'm not

---------05:35----------
gonna blame the outlet I'm not going to

---------05:37----------
blame the bulbs I'm not gonna blame the

---------05:38----------
fixtures if the light switch is switched

---------05:40----------
off second thing it could be the chip

---------05:42----------
itself is bad third thing it could be

---------05:45----------
the rail is being created the chip is

---------05:47----------
working the enable is present but it's

---------05:49----------
being shorted to ground fourth

---------05:51----------
everything there is good that chip is on

---------05:53----------
the enable is present but the input

---------05:54----------
voltage is supposed to go into that ship

---------05:56----------
is not present so if you don't have the

---------05:57----------
in you know of the

---------05:57----------
yeah here case three is true we have a

---------06:01----------
short circuit of ground 16 ohms that

---------06:02----------
means everything that supposed to be

---------06:03----------
going to that power rail is getting sent

---------06:04----------
to ground probably for it guess where

---------06:06----------
it's supposed to so we're gonna take

---------06:07----------
this board out of the case and see if we

---------06:08----------
can find this short on pH g3 Hut so the

---------06:12----------
board is out and on the desk now what do

---------06:14----------
we do from this point let's take a look

---------06:16----------
over the board and see if we can get an

---------06:17----------
idea why it's not turning on before we

---------06:22----------
use any other kind of tactics just see

---------06:25----------
what we've got all the eyesight gives us

---------06:39----------
that is a beautiful microscope image by

---------06:42----------
the way I just wanted to take this time

---------06:43----------
out to give a real heartfelt thank you

---------06:46----------
to every single one of you that bought

---------06:47----------
one of the 40 lemons you know that was a

---------06:51----------
40 limited-edition Rossmann microscopes

---------06:56----------
with the proper trinocular camera

---------06:58----------
adapter so that the image looks nice and

---------07:01----------
in focus and beautiful like this one I

---------07:03----------
really appreciate it thank you I will

---------07:05----------
not be selling another one of those

---------07:07----------
until all of that crap goes away but

---------07:09----------
still just thank you very much for all

---------07:11----------
of you who thank you I appreciate it

---------07:15----------
very much

---------07:15----------
those there are 40 people out there that

---------07:18----------
can start doing YouTube streams with

---------07:20----------
this level of microscope quality and

---------07:22----------
that's awesome I hope you use it for

---------07:26----------
amazing things

---------07:41----------
it's gonna go through this board

---------08:24----------
that little cap really did not want to

---------08:26----------
be here anymore

---------09:15----------
looks like the cable is for the camera

---------09:17----------
so cope has broke the motor and the

---------09:20----------
camera of my drone so far the camera

---------09:21----------
worked before I sent it to you the only

---------09:23----------
thing that didn't work was the road or

---------09:28----------
no seriously the camera actually did

---------09:30----------
work before I sent it's in the only

---------09:31----------
thing that didn't work was the motor

---------09:33----------
copass what the [ __ ] you did in my drone

---------09:39----------
he's certified DJI repair

---------09:47----------
that's what happened see this is what

---------09:49----------
happens when you send your device to a

---------09:50----------
certified shop

---------09:51----------
it sent my deejay Otello to a certified

---------09:54----------
DJ i repairmen rip my camera do they do

---------10:01----------
something like Apple where the cable for

---------10:03----------
the rotor me for the cable for the

---------10:05----------
propeller the motor is right next to a

---------10:08----------
wrapped around the camera cable with

---------10:10----------
glue or something like that because if

---------10:11----------
that's the case then it's understandable

---------10:41----------
all right now we're gonna find the board

---------10:43----------
to grab this off of and because I'm too

---------10:45----------
lazy to remove the display connector and

---------10:47----------
display cable because that would require

---------10:49----------
removing two screws finding a

---------10:51----------
screwdriver finding a magnet to put them

---------10:53----------
on I mean just saying it out loud is

---------10:54----------
making me sweat I can only imagine

---------10:55----------
actually doing the work I'm going to be

---------10:57----------
using the soldering iron by itself to

---------11:00----------
put this new cap on and I'll show you

---------11:01----------
how I do it it's glued otherwise the

---------11:03----------
ribbon would pop out after a single

---------11:05----------
crash and people would be raging for no

---------11:06----------
image on camera after crashing it

---------11:08----------
happens a lot even when they're glued

---------11:09----------
alright that makes sense that makes

---------11:16----------
sense

---------11:17----------
I understand it

---------11:33----------
all right so now what i'm gonna do is i

---------11:36----------
only put solder on one side notice that

---------11:37----------
see solder is on the on the bottom but

---------11:40----------
not on the top so the reason i did that

---------11:42----------
is because one of these i need to make

---------11:43----------
level so this has to be made level this

---------11:47----------
is really hard to do under a microscope

---------11:49----------
usually i would do this without the

---------11:50----------
microscope but then you wouldn't be able

---------11:51----------
to see it so i kind of have to do it

---------11:55----------
this way let's see if possible to do

---------11:57----------
this sideways like paul paul wall would

---------12:00----------
say sit in sideways it's impossible to

---------12:05----------
do this in sideways okay and now we saw

---------12:13----------
it on the top now this side over here is

---------12:17----------
gonna be closer to flat against the

---------12:21----------
board so this is how you could let's say

---------12:23----------
you didn't have a hot-air station

---------12:24----------
because something one of you asked in

---------12:25----------
the last AMA stream like what do i do if

---------12:27----------
i don't have all the tools or what if i

---------12:28----------
don with a budget have a hot-air station

---------12:30----------
well you could have you could have

---------12:32----------
bought a cap off a mauser and you could

---------12:33----------
have just kind of soldered it in like

---------12:34----------
this i didnt even though this is an SMD

---------12:36----------
component I didn't need I did not use a

---------12:40----------
hot-air station to put this in there now

---------12:42----------
is it straight

---------12:43----------
not really but do you think anybody

---------12:44----------
cares they're just going to notice that

---------12:46----------
the Apple store wanted 1500 to fix this

---------12:47----------
mop machine and that you wanted you know

---------12:51----------
100 to 500 to fix that's what's going to

---------12:53----------
matter so not perfect but clearly

---------12:57----------
something that's doable if and if you do

---------13:00----------
arch really triggered by that the way I

---------13:03----------
am right now honestly a little bit you

---------13:05----------
could just use hot air to flow it into

---------13:06----------
place I'm just going to remove that

---------13:08----------
display cable

---------13:18----------
before I burn it and we just flow that

---------13:21----------
in a place with a hot-air station but

---------13:24----------
you know the hot tweezers that Jesse

---------13:27----------
uses they're really good and they have

---------13:28----------
their use but just not for a cap that's

---------13:30----------
that large and for stuff like this it

---------13:33----------
really is handy to be able to do it with

---------13:34----------
a soldering iron this way you don't have

---------13:36----------
to serve to stuff around with heat if

---------13:38----------
that's an issue let's see what I do one

---------13:42----------
side I put solder on I put it down and

---------13:44----------
then it's flat on the board rez it's not

---------13:45----------
going to be flat on the board of both

---------13:46----------
sides of a bump and with the soldering

---------13:48----------
iron it's not odd tweezers I can't make

---------13:50----------
a I can't hit both sides at the same

---------13:52----------
time so that's why I put solder only on

---------13:55----------
one side not on both and now I pushed it

---------14:00----------
down on the board there's gonna be a

---------14:01----------
little bit of excess solder under there

---------14:02----------
it's fine I added some flux I'm just

---------14:06----------
gonna use my iron once it heats all the

---------14:08----------
way up and get that out of there no

---------14:12----------
excess beautiful beautiful so I'm just

---------14:17----------
gonna put the display cable back on

---------14:19----------
there

---------14:24----------
and then this thing is gonna work and I

---------14:26----------
think it's really important to throw

---------14:27----------
these little tidbits on there that can

---------14:28----------
help you to do some of the work that we

---------14:30----------
do even if you don't have the exact

---------14:32----------
tools because one of the things I used

---------14:33----------
to hear non-stop and drive me nuts Lois

---------14:35----------
I don't have a hot-air station I would

---------14:36----------
replace the fuse but I don't have a

---------14:38----------
hot-air station and I you don't need a

---------14:40----------
hot-air station to do everything do you

---------14:42----------
obviously you need a hot-air station if

---------14:44----------
you're gonna you want to redo an SMC or

---------14:47----------
something Duke would argue that he would

---------14:49----------
use a paint stripper which I say no to

---------14:51----------
but Duke is crazy

---------14:55----------
do you believe Duke when he says that he

---------14:57----------
uses a paint stripper for all of this

---------15:03----------
yeah she did not he wasn't up to the

---------15:06----------
using the hot air station so we're gonna

---------15:08----------
see if this thing I give us a boot

---------15:09----------
sequence now just clean off alcohol from

---------15:13----------
the desk playing the desk with a little

---------15:16----------
bit of Windex okay we're just gonna see

---------15:21----------
if we get an Apple logo this thing boo

---------15:22----------
does it turn on does it first thing I

---------15:25----------
want to do obviously is I want to see if

---------15:26----------
it takes more than 20 milliamps it was

---------15:28----------
before he was taking 20 milliamps

---------15:30----------
because the PP brush g3 hot circuit was

---------15:32----------
turning itself off rather than sitting

---------15:35----------
there and trying to deliver current it's

---------15:37----------
the short

---------15:46----------
just getting any of these cables with

---------15:48----------
metal on the top off

---------16:00----------
alright it looks like it's taking 1.5

---------16:02----------
amps that nineteen point nine volts so

---------16:06----------
we should be seeing an image shortly

---------16:08----------
says the computer has thin lines running

---------16:10----------
across the screen they disappeared and

---------16:12----------
seem to be functioning properly then the

---------16:13----------
computer would not turn on no power not

---------16:15----------
a hint of any power in one plugged in so

---------16:19----------
the lines across the screen that's gonna

---------16:20----------
be something else but I imagine perhaps

---------16:23----------
the lines happened across the screen

---------16:25----------
right as pp bus was shorting the ground

---------16:27----------
maybe that's the way the machine looks

---------16:28----------
when a crash but either way you could

---------16:29----------
see that there's an Apple logo this

---------16:31----------
machine is turning on it is taking 1.3

---------16:33----------
amps at nineteen point nine volts so we

---------16:35----------
were taking at nineteen point nine volts

---------16:37----------
we were taking 20 milliamps that tells

---------16:39----------
us that the CD 32 15 s are speaking to

---------16:41----------
the charger and tell them the charger to

---------16:42----------
put out 20 volts not 5 volts for a gopro

---------16:44----------
or 9 volts for phone but 20 volts for a

---------16:46----------
macbook that tells us to pay our CD 32

---------16:48----------
15 s are working in bpp 33 undersquare

---------16:50----------
g3 huh I work wired for the CD 33 to

---------16:52----------
needs to turn on is functioning and

---------16:54----------
working as it should so we shouldn't

---------16:55----------
look up PP 3 B 3 underscore g3 hot but

---------16:56----------
rather we should check all the other

---------16:57----------
people through all the other g3 hot

---------16:59----------
rails to ensure that they're working in

---------17:00----------
the next rail that two people three

---------17:01----------
three underscore g3 huh is going to be

---------17:03----------
PP + g3 huh we checked that rail we had

---------17:05----------
a short to ground we didn't have to

---------17:06----------
measure voltage or anything like that

---------17:07----------
and immediately when we first took out

---------17:09----------
the machine we were able to spot was a

---------17:10----------
cap on people HD 3 hot that was to

---------17:12----------
obviously short it's a ground without

---------17:14----------
having to measure with them altimeter or

---------17:15----------
replace that cap we put a new one on I

---------17:16----------
showed you how to do it without having

---------17:18----------
to use a hot-air station just in case

---------17:19----------
you're on a budget and you only have a

---------17:20----------
normal soldering iron to show you don't

---------17:22----------
even these sort of crazy special tools

---------17:24----------
to do what I do in some cases and it

---------17:26----------
works so that's it for today and as

---------17:27----------
always I hope you learned something

---------17:28----------
thank you so much for watching thank you

---------17:30----------
so much for being a part of what makes

---------17:33----------
this stuff worth doing and yeah I'll see

---------17:36----------
you in the next video bye

---------17:41----------
Paul what are you doing today taking

---------17:45----------
forever to get from one end to the other

---------17:46----------
with this drone they're too slow now

---------17:48----------
