---------00:00----------
why hello check it out

---------00:03----------
another MacBook it's in a 1708 matte

---------00:06----------
book that says no power it needs to be

---------00:09----------
fixed

---------00:09----------
let's see if we can fix it so that

---------00:11----------
highest edit a video for the main

---------00:12----------
channel if I don't fix it hi hi has

---------00:15----------
nothing to edit and will sit there

---------00:16----------
scratching his balls all day but if I do

---------00:18----------
fix it then he has to edit the video and

---------00:21----------
with his freedom of speech and this chat

---------00:23----------
is non-existent oh there's no such thing

---------00:25----------
as freedom of speech here nuh nuh no

---------00:28----------
freedom of speech exists on your

---------00:30----------
platform on your channel in your living

---------00:33----------
room in your newspaper on your blog this

---------00:36----------
is my living room everybody should be

---------00:38----------
the tyrant of their own living room

---------00:42----------
their own chats Oh God

---------00:45----------
speaking of a tyrant what the [ __ ] did

---------00:48----------
you get oh my god it was a just because

---------00:51----------
it's a MacBook does not mean it deserves

---------00:53----------
this whoa oh so this is disgusting this

---------01:05----------
is the dis dis makes me sick to look at

---------01:07----------
I don't know if it's because it's brown

---------01:08----------
corrosion versus the normal coloured

---------01:09----------
corrosion or what like I like green

---------01:12----------
corrosion but brown corrosion does

---------01:14----------
something to me Mac looks like an

---------01:19----------
expensive date they're beautiful but

---------01:20----------
they force you to pay top dollar and

---------01:21----------
everything and they only suck you off

---------01:23----------
once that's an interesting way to put it

---------01:28----------
alright so the other side of the board

---------01:31----------
is really clean actually but when you

---------01:34----------
look at

---------01:34----------
[Music]

---------01:38----------
this is the side that looks like filth

---------01:41----------
now if we were to see what kind of

---------01:43----------
amperage it's taking what it's doing and

---------01:47----------
the amp meter it does go to dye seed

---------01:52----------
vaults it doesn't turn on which is the

---------01:54----------
expected behavior here because my TPS

---------01:56----------
five one nine eight zero looks like this

---------01:58----------
so the TPS five one nine eight zero is

---------02:00----------
going to be responsible for three rails

---------02:02----------
on this eight two zero - zero zero eight

---------02:05----------
four zero board the TPS five one nine

---------02:07----------
eight zero is going to be responsible

---------02:10----------
for the PP 3 V 3 S 5 PP 5vs5 and I

---------02:15----------
believe PP 5 es 4 ladies and gentlemen I

---------02:23----------
ride on this this is a Saab Vuitton 72

---------02:27----------
one five zero this wiring is using these

---------02:30----------
really shitty connectors that are not

---------02:32----------
even waterproof because that's all they

---------02:33----------
had at the 24/7 hardware store because I

---------02:35----------
didn't want to wait to get them from

---------02:36----------
Amazon I do have to get some better

---------02:38----------
connectors than those I just is you know

---------02:41----------
and I want to figure something out I

---------02:43----------
want to figure it out now I don't want

---------02:44----------
to wait so I got these from the hardware

---------02:46----------
store that's the three Hall sensor wires

---------02:48----------
because I had to try out the different

---------02:49----------
hall sensor combinations this is my XT

---------02:52----------
90 that goes from my battery to my

---------02:54----------
controller this is for stupid [ __ ] like

---------02:57----------
I have a GoPro charger I have a cell

---------03:00----------
phone charger and I've got the wire from

---------03:02----------
my throttle and I've got the wire from

---------03:04----------
my lights and of course I have my

---------03:06----------
ignition up there and this is actually a

---------03:09----------
new wheel I got a new wheel new axle

---------03:11----------
everything because I just a new new so

---------03:14----------
this is a new axle new wheel new brake

---------03:18----------
rotor new disc brake rotor because I

---------03:21----------
just didn't want to deal with

---------03:21----------
potentially one of them being out of

---------03:23----------
alignment and it's still [ __ ] out of

---------03:25----------
alignment but yeah this is 18 how fast

---------03:28----------
does that go it goes nineteen point nine

---------03:30----------
miles an hour we may be able to make it

---------03:34----------
go 20 miles an hour if this law that's

---------03:35----------
waiting gets passed use Apple fuses as

---------03:37----------
brake pads that would destroy the rotor

---------03:39----------
oh yeah I might as well show you so from

---------03:43----------
normal view so this is the amount of

---------03:45----------
flux that I would apply to that TPS 5 on

---------03:47----------
i-90

---------03:50----------
this is my hand this is my syringe this

---------03:54----------
is my flux now if we look at it under a

---------04:00----------
microscope now if we look at it over

---------04:07----------
here microscope so what was I about to

---------04:14----------
do before I got interrupted by all of

---------04:15----------
this

---------04:16----------
oh yes I was showing you that this chip

---------04:18----------
is responsible for three voltage rails

---------04:21----------
this is responsible for four PP 5vs5 LD

---------04:31----------
L PP 3 V 3 s 5 somewhere up here down

---------04:37----------
here yeah maybe 3 V 3 s 5 and then PP 5e

---------04:45----------
s 4

---------05:02----------
[Music]

---------05:16----------
yep

---------05:20----------
oh my god I'm holding that entire I

---------05:24----------
cannot run

---------05:45----------
do any of you know how to do maintenance

---------05:47----------
on a bicycle excellent you know as much

---------05:53----------
as I do them now I was asking the people

---------06:00----------
who are putting screwdrivers to my

---------06:02----------
method of transportation through a very

---------06:04----------
crowded city of bad drivers

---------06:42----------
[Music]

---------06:52----------
[Music]

---------07:10----------
[Music]

---------07:19----------
[Music]

---------07:26----------
I fixed flat tire three times took my

---------07:28----------
back without three times in the process

---------07:30----------
and changed my hands alone and solely by

---------07:31----------
keeping myself so yeah I can do bike

---------07:32----------
main into scope as

---------07:34----------
[Music]

---------07:39----------
Oh

---------07:45----------
[Music]

---------08:48----------
time to get a chip

---------09:10----------
crowdfunded bike repair

---------09:15----------
so I'm going to start with this chip on

---------09:16----------
and after that we're gonna go over this

---------09:19----------
bicycle

---------09:41----------
[Music]

---------10:07----------
all right we're almost done soldering

---------10:09----------
this chip and well I'm doing that hi hi

---------10:11----------
is almost gonna be done putting the

---------10:12----------
camera the spare office camera by the

---------10:16----------
bicycle

---------10:36----------
[Music]

---------10:42----------
[Music]

---------10:45----------
stopping is really one of those things

---------10:47----------
that's optional

---------10:48----------
[Music]

---------11:22----------
night rasa t-that's that's really a

---------11:25----------
coins too based on preference can't say

---------11:38----------
yep it is to raise it a bit

---------11:50----------
I'm gonna check in a moment to see that

---------11:52----------
this is if this has any difference in

---------11:55----------
its ability to power on or not it

---------11:57----------
doesn't I'm probably going to wind up

---------11:59----------
just cleaning the board because this is

---------12:01----------
disgusting

---------12:23----------
okay we have 19 volts and it's still

---------12:25----------
taking 10 milliamps this board is

---------12:28----------
honestly so disgusting that I really do

---------12:29----------
want to clean it before I do anything

---------12:31----------
else to it a little sloppy but otherwise

---------12:35----------
alright

---------12:43----------
backlight caps are clearly all trashed

---------12:45----------
but again we're still trying to

---------12:47----------
troubleshoot it not turning on

---------12:58----------
as you can see the board that was not

---------13:00----------
turning on before is now taking 500

---------13:03----------
milliamps which means that it is turning

---------13:04----------
on obviously this row of back like a Paz

---------13:06----------
udders is gonna have to be trashed

---------13:08----------
because it's all junk but replacing the

---------13:10----------
TPS five one nine eight zero did do the

---------13:12----------
trick again it's a little on the little

---------13:15----------
on the sloppy side but I was the board

---------13:19----------
was a little nasty prior to me putting

---------13:21----------
the everything there

---------13:30----------
so replacing the chip did half of the

---------13:33----------
job but cleaning off the garbage and the

---------13:35----------
board did the rest I don't have my micro

---------13:38----------
pencil with me which I would usually

---------13:39----------
like to use to get inside of areas like

---------13:41----------
that I don't have my micro pencil so I

---------13:45----------
had a used by another employee for the

---------13:48----------
time being I'm out of micro pencils

---------13:52----------
[Music]

---------14:01----------
[Music]

---------14:09----------
[Music]

---------14:12----------
now which one of you is riding that one

---------14:14----------
actually it's raining and I don't have a

---------14:16----------
rear fender for that should ya I gotta

---------14:22----------
get a rear fender before I start riding

---------14:23----------
that

---------14:24----------
[Music]

---------14:35----------
[Music]

---------14:42----------
and it breaks fixed the light about back

---------14:46----------
where we started still rubbing but we'll

---------14:49----------
see if it wears itself out

---------15:05----------
it'd be really cool if I could buy a

---------15:06----------
Fender somewhere right now I wish New

---------15:08----------
York at a 24-7 bike place everybody who

---------15:14----------
says New York doesn't sleep and then

---------15:15----------
city that never sleeps it kind of does

---------15:17----------
it actually sleeps and pretty often all

---------15:19----------
the time

---------15:26----------
[Music]

---------15:31----------
this

---------15:40----------
[Music]

---------15:42----------
alright so the actual problem is not

---------15:44----------
gonna be those capacitors believe it or

---------15:46----------
not it's gonna be this

---------16:16----------
[Music]

---------16:29----------
I'm not gonna use the exacto I'm gonna

---------16:32----------
use a box cutter actually I don't even

---------16:35----------
have a box cutter or an exacto

---------16:37----------
I have nothing sharp in my desk why does

---------16:39----------
nobody trusts me with sharp things

---------16:41----------
I'm gonna use my tweezer I'm gonna use

---------16:45----------
my trusty tweezers

---------16:55----------
breaking New Year's resolutions left and

---------16:57----------
right here

---------17:05----------
[Music]

---------17:13----------
[Music]

---------17:24----------
[Music]

---------17:35----------
[Music]

---------17:54----------
[Music]

---------18:02----------
[Music]

---------18:16----------
[Music]

---------18:23----------
hmm

---------18:25----------
[Music]

---------19:37----------
these are the current sensing lines

---------19:39----------
[Music]

---------20:31----------
[Applause]

---------20:42----------
[Music]

---------20:47----------
okay so we have 44 volts on backlight so

---------20:50----------
if I put this up in a minute you should

---------20:52----------
be able to see a happy little question

---------20:55----------
mark on the screen this is a really new

---------20:57----------
machine so if it doesn't have a heatsink

---------20:58----------
and I'm not actually doing anything with

---------21:00----------
it the CPU actually clocks itself down

---------21:01----------
and it doesn't get warm so if this was

---------21:03----------
some sort of Core 2 Duo it would have

---------21:05----------
probably already be bursting spreading

---------21:06----------
flames at me right now but this is new

---------21:09----------
enough that I don't have to worry about

---------21:10----------
that for those who are worried on the

---------21:12----------
behalf of the computer as you can see we

---------21:18----------
have a question mark folder so we have

---------21:20----------
fixed the issue with no power and the

---------21:22----------
issue of no backlight so our no power

---------21:24----------
issue was caused by a bunch of corrosion

---------21:26----------
in the TPS 509 zero area not allowing PP

---------21:29----------
5 es 5 PP 5 es 4 + PP 3 V 3 s 5 - become

---------21:33----------
present our next issue which was our no

---------21:36----------
backlight issue was caused by the

---------21:39----------
current sensing section being and

---------21:41----------
corroded and actually those wires and

---------21:44----------
everything being broken off so if I were

---------21:45----------
to show you what the that area was that

---------21:48----------
was corroded those two little traces

---------21:50----------
over here you'll see that that is I

---------21:53----------
sense positive I sense negative so let's

---------21:55----------
just look that up in the schematic so I

---------21:59----------
have a lot of videos on what current

---------22:01----------
sensing is and I'd highly suggest you

---------22:02----------
check them out for you know just a

---------22:04----------
little bit more education if you don't

---------22:06----------
know what current sensing is so long

---------22:07----------
story short is Apple did something

---------22:09----------
pretty smart in these new models and

---------22:10----------
that which is put a current sensing

---------22:12----------
circuit and so the way a current sensing

---------22:13----------
circuit works is as follows this is a

---------22:15----------
resistor there's going to be a really

---------22:17----------
teeny tiny voltage drop across this

---------22:20----------
resistor it's barely any resistance at

---------22:22----------
all it's a very small number a small

---------22:23----------
percentage of resistor as Apple would

---------22:25----------
call it 0.025 pumps now this resistor is

---------22:29----------
barely resisting however there is still

---------22:32----------
going to be a tiny voltage drop across

---------22:33----------
it and that voltage drop is going to be

---------22:35----------
proportional to the amount of current or

---------22:37----------
wattage or power that the system is

---------22:39----------
using so the more current draw the

---------22:41----------
greater the voltage drop from the side

---------22:43----------
to that side now the way this works is

---------22:45----------
where this chip over here you've 8400

---------22:48----------
the backlight driver is going to measure

---------22:49----------
what that voltage drop across here is

---------22:51----------
and it's going to use that to determine

---------22:53----------
how much currents that the system is

---------22:55----------
using so if there's a large voltage

---------22:56----------
different that thinks it's using a lot

---------22:58----------
of current teeny tiny current voltage

---------23:00----------
difference it thinks it's using it

---------23:01----------
tiny amount of current now if these

---------23:03----------
traces are broken let's say it sees

---------23:05----------
eight volts on one side and zero on the

---------23:07----------
other it's gonna think oh my god the

---------23:08----------
backlight must be using zillions upon

---------23:10----------
billions of watts turn this [ __ ] off and

---------23:12----------
it's then going to disable this

---------23:14----------
transistor so this transistor is also

---------23:17----------
controlled by you 8,400 this is a

---------23:19----------
p-channel MOSFET which means it's gonna

---------23:20----------
open when the voltage on the gate over

---------23:23----------
here is less than the source over here

---------23:25----------
so you have a voltage divider that takes

---------23:27----------
the voltage from the source of this

---------23:29----------
transistor and places out on the gate

---------23:31----------
but it in order for it to be a voltage

---------23:34----------
divider it has to go to ground and

---------23:35----------
backlight s D over here is a switch

---------23:37----------
whereby instead of just taking this 12

---------23:40----------
volts from here and putting it here this

---------23:42----------
resistor if it has access to ground

---------23:44----------
through you 8401 and tells it to turn on

---------23:46----------
will lower the voltage on here to

---------23:49----------
somewhere around five or four volts and

---------23:51----------
then EQ 8400 little open but if there's

---------23:53----------
too big a voltage difference between

---------23:55----------
here and here because the current

---------23:56----------
sensing circuit is reporting them to too

---------23:58----------
much too much of a difference then this

---------24:00----------
transistor will turn off and nothing

---------24:01----------
will go to your backlight these are the

---------24:03----------
capacitors that all look screwed up and

---------24:04----------
I will replace those at a later date

---------24:07----------
because I'd actually honestly I just

---------24:09----------
kind of want to play with my toy and

---------24:10----------
[ __ ] fixing MacBooks at ten o'clock and

---------24:11----------
then at night again we're not gonna

---------24:13----------
leave it like that for the customer we

---------24:15----------
are gonna replace those capacitors to

---------24:16----------
not replace those capacitors when they

---------24:18----------
look like that would be a fairly

---------24:20----------
disgusting practice of complete

---------24:22----------
disrespect or as you may put it here

---------24:26----------
that's a disgusting practice of complete

---------24:30----------
disrespect I know what you're thinking

---------24:34----------
Lois you should just do it now why are

---------24:36----------
you being lazy just do the work now into

---------24:38----------
that I would say

---------24:40----------
[Music]

---------24:42----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------24:44----------
you learned something I'll see you in

---------24:46----------
the next one
