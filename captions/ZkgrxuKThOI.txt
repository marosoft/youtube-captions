---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be going over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero thirty four seventy six

---------00:03----------
retina it's not seeing the keyboard or

---------00:05----------
the mouse and I'm gonna be going over it

---------00:07----------
using a test housing since this customer

---------00:08----------
sent the board in with nothing else

---------00:10----------
attached to it so the board was sent in

---------00:12----------
board only these are usually a nightmare

---------00:14----------
because there's usually more problems

---------00:16----------
with them then on the actual machine and

---------00:18----------
you can gain you can bet your ass that

---------00:20----------
if something usually killed the keyboard

---------00:22----------
circuitry on the machine that the

---------00:23----------
keyboard and the mouse itself especially

---------00:25----------
when it comes to liquid is gonna be

---------00:27----------
something else wrong there but we'll get

---------00:28----------
to that part later right now let's just

---------00:30----------
focus on this you may also notice I'm

---------00:31----------
back to my old microphone the forty

---------00:33----------
sixty six is not working at the moment

---------00:36----------
I'm gonna figure that thing out just on

---------00:38----------
principle because that's a $650

---------00:41----------
microphone but yes I'm gonna be using

---------00:43----------
this until I figure that out it could be

---------00:45----------
a cabling issue it could be a somethin

---------00:48----------
issue it could be a you know it traveled

---------00:50----------
across the world bent in a box issue you

---------00:52----------
never really know but technology is

---------00:54----------
technology

---------00:54----------
I always keep my old stuff around

---------00:56----------
because as I say all the time I have no

---------00:58----------
trust for most technology so I turn this

---------01:00----------
thing on on the first thing that I did

---------01:01----------
is I tried to hold down option so that I

---------01:03----------
could confirm the customer problem on a

---------01:05----------
known working keyboard this is a test

---------01:07----------
housing this is one of my own machines

---------01:09----------
it's a little beat-up so I can't really

---------01:11----------
get much out of it if I try to sell it

---------01:13----------
or use it on the customer so as a result

---------01:15----------
I just use it for testing these when

---------01:16----------
they come in board only and I know that

---------01:19----------
the option key works none of the option

---------01:20----------
keys work on this so what we're gonna

---------01:22----------
start doing is troubleshooting first

---------01:24----------
thing let's let's just try to get an

---------01:26----------
idea of what's going on at the keyboard

---------01:27----------
circuit level so let's just switch over

---------01:29----------
to the screen capture over here and I'm

---------01:32----------
gonna go to the screen capture where is

---------01:34----------
keyboard alright so here we go so the

---------01:36----------
keyboard let's go to the board view for

---------01:38----------
a second now the keyboard is gonna plug

---------01:40----------
in over here at j48 13 so on the board

---------01:42----------
view that's where the keyboard plugs in

---------01:44----------
is j48 13 now let's go over to the PDF

---------01:50----------
and j48 13 j48 13 is actually right over

---------01:54----------
here on the page so now as you can see

---------01:56----------
in addition to this having connections

---------01:58----------
between a USB controller which is going

---------02:00----------
to pick the keyboard signal up and send

---------02:01----------
it to the CPU as a USB signal we also

---------02:05----------
have power rails going to the keyboard

---------02:06----------
so P P 3 P 3 s 4 and also a P P 3 V 4 to

---------02:09----------
underscore g3 hot over here see those

---------02:11----------
let me just get rid of my head because

---------02:12----------
that may be in the

---------02:14----------
I didn't want my head to be over there

---------02:15----------
I'm at glad I had this open broadcaster

---------02:18----------
monitor up here so right up here what

---------02:19----------
you can't see I took this extra really

---------02:22----------
really really crappy 1600 by 900 TN

---------02:25----------
screen Acer $80.00 piece of crap monitor

---------02:28----------
that I was never using for anything and

---------02:29----------
I'm just using it as an open broadcaster

---------02:31----------
screen

---------02:31----------
I don't need great quality I just like

---------02:32----------
being able to see what's up there I've

---------02:34----------
actually done videos where I had the

---------02:35----------
wind up deleting it because I was in the

---------02:38----------
microscope the whole time and I was

---------02:39----------
talking or I wish I wanted to show you

---------02:41----------
some of the microscope but I was

---------02:42----------
actually on the screen capture and it's

---------02:43----------
just nice to be able to see that out in

---------02:44----------
real time

---------02:45----------
anyway so back to here so you can see

---------02:47----------
that we have P P 3 B 3 as for MP p3 p4 2

---------02:50----------
going to the keyboard connector so this

---------02:52----------
is supposed to be 3.3 volts and that's

---------02:53----------
supposed to be three point 42 volts so

---------02:55----------
I'm gonna go on the microscope camera

---------02:56----------
right now because I don't want to short

---------02:58----------
these pins it's really really easy to

---------03:00----------
short these pins and it's very in again

---------03:02----------
if you short let's say P P 3 P 4 to the

---------03:04----------
ground on a pin you bet your ass that

---------03:05----------
pin is going to get really destroyed now

---------03:08----------
I want to do that to this board this

---------03:10----------
board is marked urgent by a company that

---------03:11----------
sends them in for for border pairs or

---------03:14----------
they send out all the spill damaged ones

---------03:15----------
that they can't figure out here so let's

---------03:18----------
see if we can figure this out it is

---------03:19----------
Labor Day weekend but I still like to

---------03:22----------
try to keep fast turnaround if you what

---------03:24----------
you have sent me is not a [ __ ] so

---------03:26----------
let's see so on this pin over here I'm

---------03:28----------
supposed to get three point three I get

---------03:30----------
two point two and over here I'm supposed

---------03:33----------
to get 3.42 I get actually 3.42 is on

---------03:38----------
pin four on the other side so let's go

---------03:39----------
over here

---------03:40----------
so 3.42 is gonna be one two three see

---------03:44----------
these people whoever designed this board

---------03:46----------
I mean I hate a lot of things about it

---------03:47----------
but see how they have these little nooks

---------03:48----------
it actually gives me space to put my

---------03:50----------
multimeter when I'm measuring for power

---------03:52----------
rails as you gotta admit is pretty cool

---------03:55----------
see that so I don't worry about one

---------03:56----------
shorting to the other I put my

---------03:57----------
multimeter probe inside there and then I

---------03:59----------
do that so what I'm getting right there

---------04:01----------
is three point four so P B 3 B 4 PP 3 B

---------04:04----------
3 S 4 is missing on my board so now what

---------04:06----------
I want to do is I want to try to I want

---------04:08----------
to trace around and figure out why PP 3

---------04:10----------
B 3 S 4 is missing on my board so let's

---------04:12----------
go back to the board view software here

---------04:14----------
I mean the schematic let's zoom in let's

---------04:16----------
find out where PP 3 V 3 S 4 starts so

---------04:19----------
one of the things I tell a lot of people

---------04:20----------
who are new to this what you want to do

---------04:22----------
is you want to check where the circuit

---------04:23----------
starts and then you also want to check

---------04:25----------
where the circuit ends so we're gonna

---------04:27----------
check P P

---------04:27----------
tv3 as for at the end so at the end was

---------04:30----------
right by the keyboard connector we're

---------04:32----------
missing it there now I want to see where

---------04:34----------
it starts yeah I don't want to see

---------04:35----------
myself go away so let's figure out where

---------04:38----------
P P 3 V 3 S 4 is created instead of

---------04:41----------
going through the entire circuit and

---------04:42----------
checking every single little thing as we

---------04:44----------
go again that can take a long long time

---------04:46----------
so again here's what I'm like here's

---------04:48----------
what I'm saying with that start an

---------04:49----------
ending

---------04:50----------
let's say this is the end this is the

---------04:51----------
keyboard connector and this is where P P

---------04:53----------
P 3 S 4 is created if you go okay where

---------04:54----------
does that come from okay where does that

---------04:55----------
come from okay where does that come from

---------04:56----------
okay where does that come from

---------04:57----------
okay where does that come from you've

---------04:58----------
measured five things that you wouldn't

---------05:00----------
have had a measure if you figured out

---------05:01----------
right at the beginning of something

---------05:02----------
wrong and the same goes if you start at

---------05:05----------
the start and then you go all the way to

---------05:06----------
the end again what you want to do is you

---------05:07----------
wanna I do here then here then here then

---------05:10----------
here then here then here so the problem

---------05:12----------
is on one end of the spectrum if it's at

---------05:15----------
the beginning of the circuit at the end

---------05:16----------
of the circuit I don't have to make a

---------05:17----------
journey all the way from the end to the

---------05:18----------
beginning just to figure that out so

---------05:20----------
let's take a look at that so again let's

---------05:22----------
go back to here that's a really

---------05:25----------
important concept if you want to stay on

---------05:26----------
this 20 minute rule again a lot of

---------05:27----------
people think my 20 minute rule is

---------05:28----------
 but when it comes went of the

---------05:31----------
board's I feel like 90% the ones that I

---------05:32----------
work on I'm sticking to that 20 minute

---------05:34----------
rule and I'm not just saying that for

---------05:35----------
backlight fuses and connectors I mean

---------05:37----------
for complex problems I like to stick to

---------05:38----------
that rule

---------05:39----------
so you 8,000 is where p b3 b3 s5 is

---------05:42----------
gonna be turned to the PP 3 b3 s 4 and

---------05:44----------
that's also gonna be going through this

---------05:46----------
little what appears to be a current

---------05:48----------
sensing resistor so let's just see

---------05:49----------
what's going on in the u 8,000 area so

---------05:51----------
I'm gonna go over to you 8,000 and let's

---------05:54----------
see what's going on in the u 8,000 area

---------05:56----------
so of course the board is flipping and I

---------05:59----------
got it oh my god how the am I

---------06:05----------
supposed to measure anything on that

---------06:06----------
piece of Wow alright so let's just

---------06:09----------
create a strategy before we even going

---------06:11----------
that so I'm gonna want to see what's on

---------06:12----------
pins oh that the chip is boss oh my god

---------06:16----------
okay peepees maybe 3 s4 underscore Fett

---------06:19----------
underscore are let's just see what's

---------06:21----------
coming out of the little piece of crap

---------06:22----------
shall we okay so I'm afraid to see what

---------06:25----------
that looks like on the motherboard

---------06:26----------
itself also sucks on this machine that

---------06:29----------
ya measuring that is gonna be a pain in

---------06:31----------
the ass

---------06:32----------
alright so let's just do this let's do

---------06:35----------
this and see what I get over here

---------06:39----------
let's see where we're in that area can I

---------06:42----------
measure all right so I can measure at

---------06:43----------
the very least on that resist this is

---------06:44----------
gonna be the output right that over

---------06:46----------
there's gonna be output so what I'm

---------06:47----------
gonna do right now is I'm gonna unplug

---------06:49----------
my keyboard unplug my trackpad keep my

---------06:53----------
motherboard on but I'm gonna turn it

---------06:56----------
upside down so that I have access to

---------06:57----------
this piece there that I need to measure

---------06:59----------
and I'm missing pp 3 B 3 s 4 so I want

---------07:02----------
to see right what PP 3 V 3 S 4 is

---------07:04----------
created if it's actually being shot out

---------07:06----------
and turning this motherboard upside down

---------07:08----------
is it going to be an absolute nightmare

---------07:10----------
with the that's plugged into it all

---------07:12----------
right so I'm just gonna unplug it for a

---------07:14----------
moment all right so I'm gonna unplug

---------07:19----------
everything but the DC and board and

---------07:20----------
unplug the screen and all that stuff and

---------07:22----------
now I'm gonna put it under the

---------07:23----------
microscope and let's find that little

---------07:24----------
component that little really really

---------07:29----------
small mofo of a component here all right

---------07:32----------
so that is it's gonna be by the USB

---------07:35----------
controller let's push the microscope in

---------07:38----------
so I have room on my table

---------07:41----------
hey it's not let's see is it that bad is

---------07:45----------
it yeah that's okay here we go

---------07:47----------
so that current sensing resistor is

---------07:48----------
indeed omitted but look at that chip

---------07:51----------
look at that little piece of crap like

---------07:53----------
really that's just that's that's that's

---------07:58----------
offensive that is offensive expecting me

---------08:02----------
to measure this is offensive all right

---------08:04----------
we're gonna make it happen though watch

---------08:06----------
so I'm gonna stretch my charger cable

---------08:09----------
over since I turned the Machine around

---------08:10----------
let's plug this in and see what I get on

---------08:13----------
the output right over there I want to

---------08:17----------
see what I'm getting on output so I get

---------08:20----------
my multimeter in voltage mode I'm gonna

---------08:22----------
take the black probe and I'm gonna put

---------08:23----------
it on a screw hole and I'm gonna take

---------08:24----------
the red probe and I'm gonna put it on

---------08:27----------
that point that it showed me on the

---------08:29----------
board view software so again see right

---------08:30----------
over here it's showing me that this

---------08:32----------
right over here this is where I want to

---------08:35----------
be measuring so this is my chip this is

---------08:36----------
where output is and over here and over

---------08:38----------
here are points where I can actually

---------08:40----------
measure on the board what's going on so

---------08:43----------
we're gonna get that in view I got my

---------08:46----------
multimeter all right so what do you guys

---------08:49----------
think I'm gonna get at this point let's

---------08:50----------
see

---------08:51----------
so I

---------08:54----------
two point four volts coming out of this

---------08:57----------
now what I want to see is what I have

---------08:58----------
going into it I have three point three

---------08:59----------
going into it so I have three point

---------09:02----------
three going into this chip but I have

---------09:03----------
two point four going out of it

---------09:05----------
and now what I want to see is I want to

---------09:06----------
see if the enable signal is there is it

---------09:08----------
actually being told to turn on most

---------09:10----------
likely is so as for power enable so I

---------09:12----------
want to see where s foul s for power

---------09:14----------
enable is going to show up and I pray

---------09:16----------
that there's a probe point somewhere by

---------09:18----------
there because it would really suck if

---------09:20----------
there weren't okay let's see so probe

---------09:24----------
points tell me but a probe point by

---------09:27----------
there because you made a little bit here

---------09:28----------
and here's what kills me here's what

---------09:29----------
really gets to me with this with its

---------09:31----------
design I totally get if like your board

---------09:33----------
is just so heavily populated you don't

---------09:35----------
got room that you need to use these

---------09:37----------
small components right are you telling

---------09:41----------
me you don't have space for this

---------09:43----------
look at this look how about a you you

---------09:44----------
have to get a trip that this small that

---------09:46----------
you can't measure anything around it it

---------09:47----------
has I get BGA for saving space right but

---------09:49----------
what about this what about this what

---------09:51----------
about the rest of the board how

---------09:54----------
about like why why would you do this

---------09:57----------
this is such anyway

---------09:59----------
so all we're done complaining now

---------10:01----------
there's nowhere convenient where I can

---------10:03----------
measure that and honestly by the time I

---------10:05----------
find a place where I can measure that I

---------10:07----------
could have actually replaced the

---------10:08----------
component so again this is all about

---------10:09----------
time so usually I'm telling you to do

---------10:12----------
certain things to save yourself the time

---------10:13----------
hassle and misery of a wasting time and

---------10:16----------
here I'm gonna save myself some time

---------10:18----------
hassle and misery by just replacing that

---------10:21----------
again like the amount of time it's gonna

---------10:23----------
take me to find the point I could just

---------10:25----------
simply replace that ship unless it so

---------10:31----------
happens that that ship has been stolen

---------10:32----------
from every one of my motherboards and

---------10:35----------
the thing is I've never used that ship

---------10:37----------
which means it was stolen by other

---------10:39----------
people mouthful is this is pissing me

---------10:43----------
off because it's like I get if I was the

---------10:46----------
one who stole it but I wasn't the one

---------10:49----------
who stole it

---------10:49----------
I bought these boards thinking that I'd

---------10:52----------
be able to grab everything off of them

---------10:53----------
but the CPU and the PCH and that's one

---------10:55----------
thing of one of them it's one thing I've

---------10:57----------
even two of them erasing that thing but

---------10:59----------
 three of them like seriously all

---------11:04----------
right so look

---------11:06----------
okay so we're gonna come up with an

---------11:08----------
alternative game plan here

---------11:10----------
are you ready for the alternative game

---------11:12----------
plan before just to figure out if this

---------11:16----------
is the cause of my problem you know what

---------11:20----------
I'm gonna do right now I am going to

---------11:23----------
take that piece of off and I am

---------11:26----------
going to shore it P P 3 P 3 s 5 2 P B 3

---------11:28----------
B 3 S 4 temporarily to see if it solves

---------11:30----------
my problem then if it solves my problem

---------11:32----------
at least I can see if it's possible to

---------11:34----------
order that thing again as I've mentioned

---------11:35----------
in other videos very often it's

---------11:37----------
impossible to even order these little

---------11:38----------
pieces that you need now just in case

---------11:42----------
it's an issue with a solder connection

---------11:44----------
underneath it because this was something

---------11:46----------
from liquid let's just see again hopeful

---------11:48----------
wishful silly thinking here if I just

---------11:50----------
surround this thing in flux and heat it

---------11:52----------
up will it actually work again again

---------11:55----------
don't do this with GPUs don't do this

---------11:56----------
with flip chip design stuff do with

---------12:00----------
really little basic things

---------12:30----------
all right a little BG a piece of

---------12:32----------
moved around a little bit so let's see

---------12:34----------
what happens when I turn the thing back

---------12:36----------
on and for all you know we just had a

---------12:40----------
little corrosion under some ball or

---------12:41----------
something it's okay little chip good

---------12:50----------
little chip all right let's turn this

---------12:53----------
thing back on and see what's going on

---------12:54----------
again we have 3.3 volts going into the

---------12:56----------
chip which is what I expect and we have

---------12:58----------
two point four volts going out of the

---------13:00----------
chip which is not what I expect

---------13:01----------
I expect three point three to go out

---------13:03----------
because three point three is going in we

---------13:11----------
still have two point four and output

---------13:13----------
mofos and of course that chip is missing

---------13:15----------
from every one of my donor boards just

---------13:17----------
really quickly let's see if I catch it

---------13:20----------
exists on a different retina board

---------13:21----------
because if it does then I can steal it

---------13:23----------
from another retina board because I have

---------13:25----------
a 15 inch retina board so we're gonna go

---------13:27----------
over to here we're gonna open another

---------13:29----------
little Andrex test link board view

---------13:32----------
software program just turn the air

---------13:34----------
filter off because I think is annoying

---------13:35----------
and let's see I have 37 87 boards so

---------13:40----------
let's see if any of those use that same

---------13:41----------
trip for you 8,000 let's see maybe we

---------13:44----------
get lucky not found you 8,000 all right

---------13:46----------
maybe let's just take a look here let's

---------13:50----------
open another one maybe it's called

---------13:52----------
something else on that board so that

---------13:53----------
I've already done this a few times and

---------13:55----------
the chip is missing from my a 1502

---------13:57----------
Boyd's I actually go and see if it's on

---------13:58----------
one of my other ones and it is BAM all

---------14:01----------
right cool so it's u-20 that exact same

---------14:06----------
chip is being used for you twenty nine

---------14:08----------
forty so maybe it's not another place on

---------14:11----------
this one - is this used more than once

---------14:17----------
it is look at that you 2940 okay I don't

---------14:22----------
even have to try another board let's

---------14:23----------
just try another on this one you 29 40

---------14:27----------
so we're gonna look out for you 29 40

---------14:30----------
and see if that's there cuz little elf

---------14:34----------
 Oh goblins stuck in here

---------14:37----------
and realize that I needed that chip and

---------14:38----------
decided you or taking it all right

---------14:42----------
so let's make sure the orientation is

---------14:44----------
the same

---------14:44----------
so pin one is at the upper left now for

---------14:47----------
the keyboard controller chip and one is

---------14:50----------
at upper left alright so the orientation

---------14:54----------
is the same so we're gonna go in the

---------14:56----------
microscope here and we're gonna remove

---------14:57----------
that little and you get the air

---------14:59----------
filter back on so I can remove that

---------15:01----------
little get you nice and focused on

---------15:08----------
the microscope here so I can see what

---------15:10----------
I'm doing

---------15:10----------
alrighty these are not good tweezers but

---------15:17----------
this is not something where I care mofo

---------15:25----------
alright you're gone mofo gone alright so

---------15:31----------
now

---------15:44----------
and use a tip that's a little better for

---------15:46----------
cleaning the board and getting rid of

---------15:47----------
the junk

---------15:49----------
so we well let's make that residual

---------15:53----------
lead-free solder go away okay get some

---------15:57----------
nice flux a nice ball of lead solder in

---------16:02----------
there and all right yeah and we have to

---------16:15----------
clean the pads anyway so that's fine

---------16:16----------
that's fine that little mess will get

---------16:18----------
cleaned up easily this good wick a

---------16:23----------
little bit of this a little bit of this

---------16:24----------
a little bit of some more heat and look

---------16:27----------
it's like the mess never happened then

---------16:29----------
it just a few seconds okay now I'm gonna

---------16:36----------
cut that little piece off and throw it

---------16:37----------
in the garbage and then we're going to

---------16:39----------
continue cleaning that area make it nice

---------16:45----------
and perfect and clean after we make it

---------16:48----------
clean we can't in it after it's tens

---------16:50----------
then we can use it so

---------17:35----------
be gentle but make sure you just be a

---------17:38----------
you get everything but be gentle all

---------17:40----------
right you've been nice and gentle now

---------17:49----------
for cleaning so that was removing the

---------17:53----------
solder that was that stage of cleaning

---------17:54----------
now we go into the stage of removing the

---------17:57----------
the flux and the residue and the junk

---------18:01----------
and blahblahblah

---------18:09----------
and a little fiber decided that I was

---------18:12----------
going to make its way to the board we're

---------18:15----------
gonna sell that fiber gtfo see the

---------18:19----------
little fiber now you don't eat your yeah

---------18:25----------
you're not a fiber all right so now now

---------18:29----------
that all the junk is gone now we're

---------18:31----------
gonna turn it properly instead of being

---------18:33----------
ten nastily so I do that

---------18:34----------
put some flux there get the iron up the

---------18:38----------
temperature let's go over those pads and

---------18:45----------
as again I made a mess on the side mofo

---------18:51----------
all right

---------19:00----------
all right so that's that's good for me

---------19:04----------
now I'm gonna take that chip from my

---------19:08----------
donor

---------19:10----------
I'm gonna surround it in flux so that I

---------19:12----------
can get hopefully keep the balls on the

---------19:15----------
board and not on the chip and surround

---------19:17----------
the chip and flux on my donor about to

---------19:20----------
lift it up move my hair

---------19:32----------
awesome okay now move my air filter back

---------19:36----------
to the board that I'm working on move

---------19:40----------
this chip back to the board that I am

---------19:42----------
working on hope that I don't flick my

---------19:46----------
tweezers because if I do this chip will

---------19:48----------
fly into the sixth dimension then never

---------19:50----------
be seen again push down on you mofo

---------20:12----------
moved in a place will be back and forth

---------20:18----------
wanna know that you're nice and set on

---------20:20----------
that board alright those balls are

---------20:23----------
really small so they're probably dry by

---------20:24----------
now if anything is not dry will be after

---------20:30----------
it gets freezing alcohol on it that'll

---------20:35----------
evaporate really fast because the board

---------20:36----------
is really hot right now so let's see if

---------20:39----------
this works let's see if let's see if we

---------20:42----------
get anything out of this so let's see if

---------20:43----------
we made any progress yeah so I'm gonna

---------20:45----------
turn this around let's put the fan on

---------20:50----------
you don't need the fantasy if it spins

---------20:52----------
let's just plug the screen and it would

---------20:55----------
be nice to have the fan just you know to

---------20:56----------
not burn the board that would be a

---------20:58----------
courtesy I guess but this is as well if

---------21:02----------
you have a heatsink on a Haswell board

---------21:04----------
that people have asked how long can I

---------21:05----------
have it on without the heatsink on a

---------21:07----------
Core 2 Duo for about 2 seconds on a Core

---------21:10----------
i5 or i7 Sandy Bridge board maybe like 5

---------21:14----------
seconds on an Ivy Bridge board maybe 7

---------21:17----------
10 seconds on a has well especially like

---------21:20----------
the these ones the dual core has well

---------21:22----------
you know like I would say 30 seconds a

---------21:25----------
minute the Ultrabook has well like I'm

---------21:29----------
pretty you can keep it without a fan for

---------21:31----------
a good while while testing I'm yeah I'm

---------21:33----------
not saying that you should do that not

---------21:35----------
saying it's the best practice in the

---------21:37----------
world but if you're just in a rush and

---------21:39----------
let's face it we don't always do

---------21:41----------
everything 100% perfect when we're

---------21:43----------
trying to figure things out at 1:00 or

---------21:44----------
2:00 in the morning you can get away

---------21:46----------
with it and nobody will kill you and

---------21:51----------
nothing is going to die but just just be

---------21:53----------
you have to know how the stuff works in

---------21:55----------
order to make those decisions again if

---------21:57----------
you have a if you have a Core 2 Duo

---------21:58----------
board from 2008 do not run that

---------22:03----------
without a heatsink just because they're

---------22:05----------
the that people will just burn alright

---------22:07----------
so I spent 20 minutes with that housing

---------22:09----------
that was ruined so that housing was not

---------22:11----------
working properly and was driving me nuts

---------22:12----------
so what I did here is I found myself a

---------22:14----------
new housing and I'm gonna be using that

---------22:16----------
to test this machine so let me turn it

---------22:18----------
on so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take an

---------22:20----------
SSD that has Yosemite on it and I'm

---------22:22----------
gonna boot into that SSD that has

---------22:23----------
Yosemite to see if my keyboard and my

---------22:25----------
truck

---------22:26----------
pad work so again my screen was cracked

---------22:28----------
on the other one screen was actually

---------22:30----------
much worse after so I couldn't really

---------22:31----------
use it to test much of anything so let's

---------22:34----------
see what this thing does so in a

---------22:36----------
different housing again it's turning on

---------22:38----------
so I am I forgot to pee RAM reset or

---------22:41----------
choose which Drive so it's gonna take a

---------22:43----------
while to boot up from that Drive over

---------22:44----------
there so let's just give it a minute to

---------22:46----------
boot up from that drive and then we're

---------22:47----------
gonna see what's going on now in the

---------22:48----------
meantime while we're waiting for this to

---------22:50----------
boot let me just go over a little bit of

---------22:51----------
what was actually wrong with this board

---------22:53----------
so that you can hopefully learn

---------22:54----------
something just in case you weren't

---------22:56----------
paying attention over the course of the

---------22:58----------
video it's always good to recap at the

---------22:59----------
end of it so the problem that was going

---------23:01----------
on here is that right at PB 3 B 3 S 4

---------23:05----------
was only 2 point 2 volts right now over

---------23:08----------
here this is the beginning of the

---------23:09----------
circuit at the beginning of the circuit

---------23:11----------
over here where 3.3 volts 4 PP 3 V 3 s 5

---------23:15----------
that's gonna be sent over to where PP 3

---------23:17----------
V 3 S 4 is gonna be this was not working

---------23:19----------
so P P 3 P 3 s 5 is going into it we

---------23:22----------
want that to show up on output as well

---------23:24----------
but only two volts are showing there now

---------23:26----------
obviously the enable signal is there the

---------23:28----------
enable signal has to have been there

---------23:29----------
because this it was actually trying to

---------23:32----------
turn on if there was no enable signal

---------23:33----------
there you would have just seen zero

---------23:35----------
volts on output but you saw two volts on

---------23:37----------
out which meant it was trying to turn on

---------23:39----------
it just couldn't now I tried be flowing

---------23:41----------
you 8,000 with some flux under it didn't

---------23:43----------
work so I replaced it and now I have 3.3

---------23:45----------
volts where P P 3 P 3 S 4 is supposed to

---------23:48----------
be and we're gonna see if my keyboard

---------23:50----------
and my trackpad work again this is why I

---------23:52----------
say it's very very important to check

---------23:53----------
the beginning in the end of the circuit

---------23:54----------
so you don't waste time so what I did

---------23:57----------
over here is I checked at the end of the

---------23:59----------
circuit that's where the keyboard

---------24:00----------
supposed to be getting power and the

---------24:01----------
trackpad is supposed to be getting power

---------24:03----------
and I had nothing so instead of going to

---------24:04----------
let you take the resistor before that

---------24:06----------
and then the trace and the fee yes and

---------24:09----------
every other point it shows up a fuck-all

---------24:10----------
that you because that's gonna waste a

---------24:11----------
lot of time and time is something that I

---------24:13----------
don't have a lot of I have a lot of

---------24:15----------
stuff to fix and I am one person I don't

---------24:17----------
have interns here I don't have other

---------24:19----------
employees that fix motherboards I don't

---------24:21----------
have a staff to fixes motherboards it's

---------24:22----------
just me and I have a lot of stuff to do

---------24:25----------
so the way I'm gonna get everything done

---------24:26----------
very quickly is I'm going to look at the

---------24:28----------
beginning of the circuit and see if it's

---------24:29----------
there so instead of going is okay the

---------24:31----------
powers not here let's see if it's here

---------24:33----------
it's not here let's see if it's there

---------24:34----------
that's out there let's see if it's there

---------24:35----------
and then going all the way to the

---------24:36----------
beginning and wasting all that stupid

---------24:38----------
time what I did it's not a thing

---------24:39----------
to the circuit let's skip all this

---------24:41----------
is it at the beginning because if it is

---------24:43----------
at the beginning well then I have to go

---------24:45----------
back and troubleshoot from each way but

---------24:47----------
if it is not at the beginning then I

---------24:49----------
save myself the trouble of checking here

---------24:50----------
and here and here and here and here so I

---------24:52----------
instead of checking the end then one

---------24:54----------
step this way then one step this way

---------24:55----------
then one step this way the one step this

---------24:56----------
way I checked the end of the circuit

---------24:58----------
nothing beginning of the circuit and

---------25:00----------
then at the beginning of the circuit I

---------25:02----------
didn't have one I needed so I knew that

---------25:03----------
ok I'm gonna I'm gonna check over here

---------25:05----------
now we give the beginning of the circuit

---------25:07----------
how what I needed then I would check

---------25:08----------
over here

---------25:08----------
and here and then here and then here and

---------25:10----------
I would start going through the middle

---------25:12----------
from each side like this instead of

---------25:14----------
going you know in this linear order

---------25:16----------
because when you go in that linear order

---------25:17----------
you waste a lot of time and again the

---------25:18----------
way I'm able to get all the stuff done

---------25:20----------
very often in 20 minutes or less is by

---------25:23----------
not wasting time on Aaron s so

---------25:25----------
here I've vlog I've loaded up into the

---------25:27----------
O's cemani desktop login screen I'm

---------25:32----------
gonna type in my really secure password

---------25:33----------
of one two three four I'm going to move

---------25:37----------
the mouse over to here and I'm gonna

---------25:39----------
click it just to make sure that the

---------25:41----------
mouse works as well and I'm logging in

---------25:43----------
with my really secure password over

---------25:44----------
there and as you can see my keyboard in

---------25:50----------
my trackpad work so again before it did

---------25:52----------
not recognize the keyboard or the

---------25:53----------
trackpad at all it did not work one bit

---------25:55----------
now the keys in the keyboard work the

---------25:57----------
trackpad moves the trackpad Clips clicks

---------26:00----------
and all of this is recognized and good

---------26:02----------
to go there's another board off of the

---------26:04----------
list and again I hope you learned

---------26:06----------
something
