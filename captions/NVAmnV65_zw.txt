---------00:00----------
hi today I want to discuss something

---------00:01----------
that really annoys me when it comes to a

---------00:03----------
lot of Apple's products and this has

---------00:04----------
nothing to do with the functionality of

---------00:06----------
them from either a consumer or a

---------00:07----------
professional standpoint or how it is you

---------00:09----------
use them rather this has to do with

---------00:10----------
servicing them overall Apple tries to

---------00:13----------
get you to purchase a new device instead

---------00:15----------
of repair your old one and I'm not just

---------00:17----------
talking about their own internal

---------00:18----------
practices with their own internal

---------00:20----------
repairs I'm also talking about with the

---------00:23----------
information that they do give out or the

---------00:25----------
lack of information they put out and on

---------00:27----------
rare occasion how they actually go above

---------00:29----------
and beyond to make it impossible to

---------00:32----------
service their products when there is

---------00:33----------
absolutely no benefit to the product

---------00:36----------
when they do that no security added to

---------00:39----------
the end-user nothing there is it is

---------00:41----------
pretty much just a middle finger to the

---------00:43----------
people who actually want to service

---------00:44----------
their existing product rather than

---------00:46----------
purchase a new one I'd like to go into

---------00:47----------
that a little bit in this video I like

---------00:49----------
to show you how it is we use some of the

---------00:51----------
limited resources available to actually

---------00:53----------
make these products work again for a

---------00:54----------
considerable amount less than what Apple

---------00:56----------
will ask and I like to start with an a

---------00:59----------
1278 MacBook Pro so this is a very very

---------01:02----------
common issue that it's experienced on

---------01:03----------
this model where sometimes you'll notice

---------01:06----------
that when you plug the charger and it's

---------01:07----------
fast but when you unplug the charger the

---------01:09----------
computer becomes really really unusable

---------01:11----------
slow so let me just show you what I'm

---------01:14----------
talking about here on the camera it may

---------01:15----------
be a little bit difficult to see because

---------01:17----------
I have the cameras at the facial focus

---------01:18----------
so let's just see if I can get it to

---------01:20----------
focus on the screen here so that you can

---------01:21----------
actually see the cursor so see when I go

---------01:24----------
to move the cursor how it's not really

---------01:26----------
responsive how the mouse is moving but

---------01:29----------
it's kind of it's it's lagging in

---------01:31----------
response to how I'm touching it not only

---------01:33----------
is it lagging from the moment that I

---------01:34----------
touched the touchpad but also when I

---------01:36----------
start moving the mouse it's kind of it's

---------01:38----------
jittery it's not really like making a

---------01:40----------
fluid movement it's like moving you know

---------01:43----------
kind of just kind of that really slow

---------01:47----------
now this is very commonly caused with a

---------01:50----------
sensor failure so the way these machines

---------01:53----------
work is they want to measure a bunch of

---------01:55----------
different things going on with the

---------01:56----------
computer it wants to know how much

---------01:58----------
current how much amperage of much power

---------02:00----------
is my CPU using how much power is the

---------02:02----------
charger using how much power is the

---------02:03----------
battery using what voltage is this point

---------02:06----------
at at this time how hot is my CPU how

---------02:09----------
hot is the graphics chip how hot is the

---------02:12----------
area near the trackpad

---------02:13----------
if one of these sensors is reading bad

---------02:16----------
value or something that's out of

---------02:18----------
specification it will either turn off

---------02:20----------
the computer or it will make the

---------02:21----------
computer one at the slowest possible

---------02:23----------
clock speed that it can in order to

---------02:26----------
prevent what it would perceive to be as

---------02:28----------
damage if it's running in in this

---------02:30----------
improper State so that what's doing here

---------02:32----------
is its clocking down the machine and

---------02:34----------
make it run really really slow so that

---------02:36----------
it doesn't damage it if it perceives

---------02:37----------
that something is wrong

---------02:38----------
now what I've run here is something

---------02:40----------
called the is an apple apple service

---------02:42----------
apple hardware test and what it says

---------02:44----------
right over here is P bus sensor so P bus

---------02:49----------
sensor is reading below the low points

---------02:52----------
that's vp0 our P bus sensor now just to

---------02:56----------
be clear here this is a test that if I

---------02:59----------
were to go into an Apple Store they're

---------03:00----------
not gonna get me if I'm gonna call up

---------03:01----------
Apple they're not gonna give it to me I

---------03:03----------
can't get this test from Apple the only

---------03:05----------
way I can get it again just just to be a

---------03:07----------
hundred percent clear here we do not nor

---------03:09----------
have we ever redistributed any of this

---------03:12----------
stuff we've never

---------03:14----------
aw we've never distributed it and we

---------03:16----------
have never uploaded it what we did to

---------03:18----------
get this is we googled Apple hardware

---------03:20----------
test the first result on Google pops up

---------03:22----------
I click a little download button and

---------03:24----------
then I download the test from that

---------03:26----------
website I don't think that that website

---------03:28----------
really is a great relationship with

---------03:30----------
Apple if you ask me yeah but the point

---------03:32----------
here is that this is not something that

---------03:34----------
you can really they want you to have

---------03:36----------
your hands on so I get this Apple

---------03:38----------
hardware test and it tells me the exact

---------03:41----------
sensor that failed I'm gonna show you

---------03:43----------
again I'm gonna show you later on in

---------03:44----------
this video how I use that information to

---------03:46----------
repair what's wrong with the machine now

---------03:48----------
let me show you what's going on with the

---------03:50----------
newer machine so there's no test

---------03:53----------
available you cannot find this online

---------03:54----------
you cannot get it from Apple there's

---------03:56----------
nothing available all you get with the

---------03:58----------
newest MacBook Pro Retina is this so

---------04:01----------
this is again another machine with a

---------04:02----------
sensor failure so the fan is running

---------04:04----------
really loud all the time as you can hear

---------04:06----------
if I put it to my face and let me show

---------04:09----------
you what it is that it says all you can

---------04:11----------
do is hold down D to get this diagnostic

---------04:13----------
test which is not much of a diagnostic

---------04:14----------
test so it says over here there may be

---------04:17----------
an issue with the system management

---------04:19----------
controller and there may be an issue

---------04:21----------
with the camera so it says reference

---------04:24----------
code pfm zero zero six

---------04:27----------
now again I don't know if you're able to

---------04:28----------
see that there may be an issue with this

---------04:30----------
camera there may be an issue with the

---------04:31----------
system management controller now I'd

---------04:33----------
like to talk here about why this is is

---------04:35----------
complete crap so they're not telling me

---------04:38----------
what sensor is failed again the sensors

---------04:41----------
are read by the SMC this here reads

---------04:44----------
every single one of the SMC sensors and

---------04:46----------
says what fails what that thing does

---------04:47----------
over there is it says you have a problem

---------04:50----------
good luck figuring it out so let's just

---------04:52----------
google and see what that code means

---------04:54----------
because maybe maybe I'm wrong maybe

---------04:56----------
Apple are in jackasses maybe they're

---------04:57----------
maybe I'm just missing how nice they

---------04:59----------
were and maybe they're they actually

---------05:01----------
have a proper code so that I can figure

---------05:03----------
this out so if I were to Google if I

---------05:07----------
were to Google pfm 0:06

---------05:10----------
looks like I already did this already

---------05:11----------
from that browser tab and I click let's

---------05:13----------
see is it gonna tell me what sensor

---------05:15----------
failed is it gonna tell me what the

---------05:16----------
problem is pfm 0:06 contact Apple or

---------05:20----------
take your computer to an Apple

---------05:21----------
authorized service provider of blah blah

---------05:23----------
blah determine which service and support

---------05:25----------
options are available this is crap you

---------05:28----------
know why this is crap because what you

---------05:30----------
know what happens and you have this

---------05:31----------
problem when you have this problem and

---------05:32----------
you take it to an Apple Store

---------05:33----------
they offer you some tier 3 or tier 4

---------05:35----------
repair which is $750 and they do not

---------05:39----------
give two shits of a what your

---------05:41----------
computer is actually worth what they're

---------05:43----------
charging you to fix it is seven hundred

---------05:46----------
and fifty dollars sometimes more for the

---------05:48----------
higher end retinas now here's the

---------05:50----------
problem you see this machine over here

---------05:52----------
this machine over here is from 2011 2012

---------05:57----------
run 2011 so the problem here is that

---------05:59----------
that computer is worth between six and

---------06:01----------
seven hundred dollars when it works

---------06:02----------
nobody in their right mind is going to

---------06:05----------
spend seven hundred fifty dollars to

---------06:07----------
repair a computer that is 600 to 700

---------06:10----------
dollars particularly when the problem

---------06:12----------
with it is nothing to do with the data

---------06:13----------
so if somebody really needed the

---------06:14----------
information on this computer they could

---------06:16----------
take that drive pop it in a little $15

---------06:18----------
enclosure and put it in another machine

---------06:20----------
just fine there is no reason to spend

---------06:22----------
$100 more than the machine is actually

---------06:24----------
worth and market value to repair it so

---------06:27----------
they may seek to bring it to somebody

---------06:29----------
else who wants to repair it like me now

---------06:31----------
if I don't have access to the diagnostic

---------06:34----------
tools because you've taken all of them

---------06:35----------
away you don't produce them anymore and

---------06:37----------
you leave them only for internal use

---------06:39----------
again go to an Apple Authorized service

---------06:40----------
Vidor that means that you are pretty

---------06:43----------
much stuck you within the monopoly of

---------06:45----------
Apple spending $750 to repair a device

---------06:48----------
that again may be worth 600 or 500 or

---------06:51----------
$400 what they've done is they've taken

---------06:52----------
away your choice to choose who it is you

---------06:55----------
want to service your expensive product

---------06:57----------
that you paid two or three or four

---------06:58----------
thousand dollars for at your initial

---------07:00----------
time of purchase and that's wrong in the

---------07:03----------
car industry you you can't do that

---------07:05----------
anymore like if I go to Apple and I say

---------07:07----------
I have a million dollars I want to buy a

---------07:09----------
diagnostic a piece of software they

---------07:11----------
won't offer that to me for any amount of

---------07:13----------
money but in within the auto industry

---------07:15----------
there's been a lot of new laws coming up

---------07:17----------
over the past two or four years where

---------07:18----------
car manufacturers they cannot keep

---------07:22----------
independent mechanics from having this

---------07:24----------
you can be in a position where you buy a

---------07:26----------
car and the only person who can service

---------07:27----------
that car is the dealer that's

---------07:30----------
and it should be for every

---------07:32----------
single other type of device as well you

---------07:34----------
cannot charge insane amounts to sell

---------07:37----------
these products than insane amounts to

---------07:38----------
repair them and say that nobody else can

---------07:40----------
fix them and again here's the other

---------07:42----------
thing that that's kind of wrong with

---------07:44----------
this and here's where it gets ironic and

---------07:45----------
hypocritical so this is telling me how

---------07:48----------
to fix the motherboard so the

---------07:49----------
motherboard is the problem with this

---------07:51----------
computer and the motherboard is the

---------07:52----------
problem with that computer so what this

---------07:54----------
is doing is it's telling me how to fix

---------07:56----------
the motherboard now the software that

---------07:59----------
will tell the person using it what

---------08:01----------
sensor on the board is wrong so they can

---------08:02----------
fix the motherboard is only available at

---------08:05----------
Apple or Apple authorized service

---------08:06----------
providers here's where this becomes

---------08:08----------
really ironic and really hypocritical

---------08:10----------
 so the only people who can have

---------08:12----------
access to the proper diagnostic tools

---------08:14----------
that actually tell you what sensor

---------08:16----------
failed in the motherboard so that you

---------08:17----------
can fix the motherboard or Apple but

---------08:20----------
Apple doesn't fix motherboards they

---------08:23----------
replace them the Apple authorized

---------08:25----------
service provider when you bring it to

---------08:27----------
the store and has that error code it

---------08:29----------
will say on their service manual in the

---------08:31----------
screen replace MLB what that means is

---------08:34----------
replaced main logic board so you're

---------08:37----------
giving you all you're limiting the

---------08:39----------
diagnostic software to people who will

---------08:42----------
be using this diagnostic software to say

---------08:44----------
I'm not fixing this what the so

---------08:48----------
again a repair shop like mine that's

---------08:50----------
actually set up with a $7000 rework

---------08:52----------
station and another two or three

---------08:54----------
thousand

---------08:55----------
our inspection and rework setup over

---------08:56----------
here so that we can actually repair

---------08:58----------
these things you're not gonna give me

---------09:00----------
the tool I need to fix the motherboard

---------09:01----------
but you're gonna give the tools that are

---------09:03----------
required to repair motherboards to

---------09:05----------
people who do not fix motherboards whose

---------09:08----------
internal policy it is do not repair the

---------09:11----------
customer's motherboard what the and

---------09:14----------
again this is just where it gets into

---------09:17----------
into a really spiteful territory where

---------09:19----------
you are going out of your way to make it

---------09:22----------
difficult for you going out of your way

---------09:23----------
to provide the consumer with less

---------09:26----------
options so they are forced to buy a new

---------09:29----------
one or encouraged to buy a new one again

---------09:30----------
if you're gonna tell me that my $650

---------09:33----------
device will cost 750 to be repaired and

---------09:35----------
there were no options because you have

---------09:37----------
limited those options because you have

---------09:38----------
taken them away by starving the

---------09:41----------
independent service centers of what they

---------09:43----------
need to actually repair them properly

---------09:45----------
I'm probably just gonna buy a new one

---------09:47----------
I'm gonna go and buy a refurbished

---------09:48----------
MacBook Air for eight hundred nineteen

---------09:50----------
dollars because again why am I gonna

---------09:51----------
spend 750 to fix something when I could

---------09:53----------
pay 819 to does buy another one from you

---------09:56----------
and the machine that I have is worth six

---------09:58----------
hundred bucks

---------09:59----------
there's no point so we are on the high

---------10:01----------
end of pricing just just to make it

---------10:02----------
clear we are in the middle of Manhattan

---------10:04----------
if I want to walk a few blocks and buy a

---------10:06----------
bottle of water it's three bucks if I

---------10:08----------
want to live upstairs where the you know

---------10:10----------
there's this probably ants roaming

---------10:12----------
around and the building looks like

---------10:14----------
and this do the floors do this and the

---------10:17----------
apartment is not much bigger than this

---------10:18----------
office except for the fact that it is a

---------10:20----------
shower that's gonna cost me twenty six

---------10:22----------
hundred dollars just to give you an idea

---------10:23----------
of how expensive it is that is the cost

---------10:25----------
of living in this area and even with the

---------10:26----------
cost of living being so insanely high in

---------10:28----------
this area we charge 325 plus tax to

---------10:31----------
repair this problem which again a lot of

---------10:33----------
people consider high but you got to

---------10:34----------
consider the area you have to consider

---------10:36----------
that in my area everything is expensive

---------10:37----------
and that price is half the price at

---------10:40----------
Apple so we're charging half what Apple

---------10:43----------
would charge so if Apple or an apple

---------10:45----------
authorized service provider even in the

---------10:47----------
middle of nowhere where you can get a

---------10:49----------
beautiful apartment for 350 bucks a

---------10:51----------
month even in the middle of nowhere

---------10:52----------
where you can have a bottle of water for

---------10:53----------
75 cents it's 750 bucks whereas here in

---------10:57----------
the mecca of ripoff in the middle of

---------11:00----------
Manhattan we're charging half the rate

---------11:02----------
and again all around the world there are

---------11:04----------
people charging much less than Apple

---------11:06----------
it's a year look

---------11:08----------
like places in other countries when

---------11:10----------
they're charging a hundred nine bucks to

---------11:11----------
fix this entire issue and that's the

---------11:13----------
other thing to talk about here are the

---------11:15----------
other countries there are areas of the

---------11:16----------
world where there are people that I talk

---------11:18----------
to and they're like okay Apple said if I

---------11:20----------
want this done I need to go to an

---------11:22----------
authorized service center the AG closest

---------11:24----------
Apple authorized service center is a six

---------11:27----------
hour flight that would cost me $900 do

---------11:31----------
you have an alternative solution and

---------11:32----------
they'll say no you have to realize there

---------11:34----------
are a lot of areas of the world there

---------11:35----------
are no Apple authorized service centers

---------11:37----------
but there are no retail Apple locations

---------11:40----------
well your only option is third party so

---------11:42----------
if you offer no options to third parties

---------11:44----------
but again I'm a you then how are

---------11:47----------
people supposed to have these products

---------11:48----------
serviced one of the things that you have

---------11:50----------
to think about here is that one of the

---------11:52----------
the pros of Apple products since they

---------11:54----------
are everywhere now and since their

---------11:56----------
products are simple again you'll see two

---------11:58----------
or three new Apple products released a

---------12:00----------
year in terms of laptop and cell phone

---------12:02----------
whereas Samsung and HTC and blend all

---------12:05----------
these other brands in a soos and a

---------12:07----------
Sorento shiba though they will out

---------12:08----------
a hundred products in a year whereas

---------12:10----------
this is only one or two is that many

---------12:13----------
repair shops stock parts for them

---------12:15----------
anywhere pair of shops know how to fix

---------12:16----------
them because they they're they're

---------12:17----------
ubiquitous they're everywhere you see

---------12:19----------
this product everywhere and since

---------12:21----------
there's only one or two of them it's

---------12:22----------
really easy to stock parts for it again

---------12:24----------
if I want to fix Apple phones I stock

---------12:26----------
two or three screens and I'm set I want

---------12:28----------
to fix HTC or Samsung phones or I want

---------12:30----------
to fix Android phones

---------12:31----------
I got a stock like 40 or 60 different

---------12:33----------
things a year so while a lot of places

---------12:36----------
will be able to offer 20 minute

---------12:38----------
turnaround on Apple products they'll

---------12:39----------
offer longer turn around than everything

---------12:41----------
else so a selling point of Apple

---------12:42----------
products even with the you that

---------12:45----------
you're getting giving everybody now is

---------12:46----------
that if you need third-party support if

---------12:48----------
you need warranty if you need out a

---------12:50----------
warranty support because you've broken

---------12:51----------
something that support is there much

---------12:53----------
faster than it will be for a lot of

---------12:54----------
other brands but you don't and imagine

---------12:57----------
what would be able to be like if you

---------12:58----------
offer that help to all these service

---------13:01----------
centers and you know that that's

---------13:03----------
something that you really should think

---------13:05----------
about while you're giving this you

---------13:06----------
to everybody and again this is not just

---------13:08----------
with the laptops it's also with cell

---------13:10----------
phones let's talk about the iPhone 5s

---------13:12----------
for a second we're good there's no

---------13:13----------
reason for this outside of pure spite to

---------13:16----------
make these policies so with the iPhone

---------13:18----------
5s you know how they made a difference

---------13:20----------
from the five if you're not really a

---------13:21----------
tech savvy user so on the

---------13:22----------
on 5's you don't have to type in a

---------13:24----------
passcode to login on the iPhone 5s you

---------13:26----------
can simply swipe your finger and when

---------13:28----------
you put your finger there and touch it

---------13:30----------
it knows who you are and it opens the

---------13:32----------
phone well if you were to place that

---------13:34----------
home button for any reason outside of

---------13:36----------
Apple this feature will never work again

---------13:39----------
you will never have touch ID and this is

---------13:41----------
a very common thing you may wonder how

---------13:42----------
often you have to replace the home

---------13:43----------
button well how often if you had a power

---------13:46----------
button stop working on your iPhone how

---------13:48----------
often have you had the volume buttons

---------13:49----------
stopped working on your iPhone how often

---------13:52----------
if you at the home button not get

---------13:53----------
responsive on your iPhone it's really a

---------13:55----------
very very common and widespread flaw

---------13:57----------
that the buttons will go bad now even if

---------14:00----------
your button doesn't go bad from

---------14:01----------
regularly use maybe it goes bad from

---------14:03----------
some type of liquid damage how many

---------14:04----------
people that are watching this video have

---------14:06----------
been Apple and heard that they had

---------14:07----------
liquid damage when they had never had

---------14:09----------
liquid inside the machine a lot of these

---------14:11----------
people actually did have liquid they

---------14:12----------
just didn't realize it with the cell

---------14:13----------
phone this is very common you could go

---------14:16----------
running you can go for a jog with your

---------14:17----------
phone in your pockets you could listen

---------14:18----------
to music and the sweat from your body

---------14:21----------
well if it's seeping into your pocket

---------14:23----------
well actually get into the home button

---------14:24----------
and it will corrode it so that it

---------14:25----------
doesn't work anymore and this is a

---------14:27----------
common problem so if you go to have that

---------14:30----------
problem fixed outside of Apple because

---------14:33----------
you don't want to pay whatever apple's

---------14:34----------
rate is the problem here again apple

---------14:36----------
with water damage they will tell you 200

---------14:39----------
or 300 bucks and swap out the phone you

---------14:41----------
may not really be willing to spend $300

---------14:43----------
to have your phone fixed of all you have

---------14:44----------
is a little home button problem you want

---------14:46----------
to go to an unauthorized center who's

---------14:47----------
just gonna give you that five to twenty

---------14:49----------
dollar home button charge you 20 to 70

---------14:52----------
bucks to put it in and be on your merry

---------14:54----------
way the problem is again when you switch

---------14:57----------
that outside of Apple that function will

---------14:59----------
never work again they tie the home

---------15:00----------
button in the Flex than in there they

---------15:02----------
tie that part to the actual motherboard

---------15:05----------
of the phone so if you try to switch it

---------15:07----------
you're

---------15:08----------
it can only be programmed at an Apple

---------15:10----------
Retail Store there is absolutely no

---------15:12----------
reason for this there is no good

---------15:14----------
functional or security reason at all for

---------15:16----------
that to be tied to the phone that is

---------15:18----------
purely a you to third-party service

---------15:20----------
centers and that is again a you to

---------15:22----------
you if you want to fix your own phone

---------15:24----------
this has been made worse with the iPhone

---------15:26----------
6 so in the iPhone 5s if you wanted to

---------15:29----------
get that fixed outside of Apple okay I

---------15:30----------
don't have touch ID but at least my

---------15:32----------
phone will work with the iPhone 6 what

---------15:35----------
they did is they made it to that

---------15:36----------
when when you change the home button

---------15:38----------
outside of Apple not only do you lose

---------15:40----------
your touch ID but your phone will die it

---------15:42----------
will become a brick if you ever update

---------15:44----------
it so if you would if you want to run an

---------15:46----------
iOS update if you want to upgrade to a

---------15:48----------
newer version of the operating system

---------15:49----------
because updates are coming out all the

---------15:50----------
time you will get error 53 error 53

---------15:54----------
pretty much means you're you are

---------15:57----------
never getting your data you are never

---------15:58----------
using this phone again it's done for

---------16:01----------
your phone is screwed and that's what

---------16:03----------
happens when you try to update the OS if

---------16:05----------
you've changed your home button now what

---------16:08----------
really makes this absolutely disgusting

---------16:10----------
is that there's no information about

---------16:11----------
this so let's say you as a user just

---------16:13----------
want to replace your own home button

---------16:14----------
there's no warning on Apple's website

---------16:16----------
there's no warning in the software that

---------16:18----------
says hey you're about to upgrade your

---------16:20----------
phone but I'm gonna your phone a

---------16:22----------
high hell because you change your home

---------16:24----------
button that's just something you should

---------16:25----------
know before you hit OK in the update but

---------16:27----------
they're not gonna tell you that it's

---------16:29----------
spiteful that's wrong it's but

---------16:32----------
for some reason we live in a world where

---------16:34----------
they are allowed to get away with this

---------16:36----------
and this is okay and it's not okay and

---------16:38----------
they shouldn't get away with it and we

---------16:40----------
shouldn't put up with it as end-users

---------16:42----------
but for some reason we do because so

---------16:43----------
many people like their products so let's

---------16:45----------
go into how we can fix this enough

---------16:47----------
talking and let's get to actually

---------16:48----------
getting something done so it says that

---------16:50----------
the VP 0rp Bus sensor is reading below

---------16:53----------
the limits so let's see how when the

---------16:55----------
diagnostic information is available

---------16:57----------
let's see how it is we solve that

---------16:59----------
problem so I'm gonna go over here to

---------17:01----------
this command I'm gonna try to find that

---------17:03----------
so let us try to find that here let's

---------17:06----------
find the schematic again that's also

---------17:08----------
something that I have to Google to finds

---------17:09----------
because and you can't buy it from Apple

---------17:13----------
you can't get it from them they don't

---------17:14----------
want you to have that information they

---------17:16----------
want you to buy another one they want

---------17:18----------
everybody servicing their products that

---------17:19----------
get screwed over so that again they they

---------17:21----------
can be the only one to service their

---------17:24----------
products or ridiculously high prices so

---------17:26----------
that you don't have them serviced so

---------17:29----------
let's switch over to here and let's go P

---------17:31----------
bus P bus voltage sense enable and

---------17:33----------
filter so let's see what this area looks

---------17:36----------
like here because I'm gonna guess that

---------17:37----------
that is something to do with it

---------17:38----------
so I'm gonna close the machine right now

---------17:40----------
and I'm gonna unplug the battery I'm

---------17:44----------
gonna take the motherboard out of the

---------17:45----------
machine and I'm gonna put it under the

---------17:47----------
microscope so I want you to actually see

---------17:49----------
what it is

---------17:50----------
I'm looking in I want you to see what's

---------17:51----------
going on with it so let's look at what's

---------17:53----------
going on in the q 5300 area and also and

---------17:57----------
let's see so SMC P bus V sense I'm gonna

---------18:02----------
see what's going on in that area so well

---------18:05----------
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open this

---------18:06----------
board view software over here and the

---------18:09----------
board view software so let's see so we

---------18:11----------
were looking at what components looking

---------18:13----------
at Q 5300 Oh Q 5300 why on the right

---------18:26----------
board I may be on the wrong motherboard

---------18:28----------
here yeah I'm on the wrong motherboard

---------18:31----------
okay let me open the right motherboard

---------18:32----------
so that it don't look like a complete

---------18:34----------
idiot okay Q 5300 all right so that's

---------18:43----------
here

---------18:53----------
by the way one thing that know is that

---------18:54----------
the reason you don't see this discussed

---------18:56----------
is because most people who do this and

---------18:58----------
who know these things they they're

---------19:00----------
afraid that if they discuss this openly

---------19:01----------
that they'll get in trouble and they

---------19:04----------
don't want to get in trouble they don't

---------19:05----------
want to rock the boat they just want to

---------19:06----------
continue making their living and just

---------19:09----------
move on and I wish sometimes it would

---------19:12----------
probably be best if I had the discipline

---------19:15----------
and also the the good sense to do that

---------19:17----------
but when I realize that I'm being

---------19:20----------
and that there's something in the world

---------19:22----------
that is not the way it should be and

---------19:23----------
that not only am I getting but

---------19:26----------
other people are getting that

---------19:27----------
consumers are getting that other

---------19:30----------
people who do what I do are getting

---------19:31----------
 I just feel they need to talk

---------19:33----------
about it

---------19:33----------
because that's that's how you that's how

---------19:35----------
change happens I I kind of I want to be

---------19:37----------
a part of the change that I want to see

---------19:39----------
in the world so it says that q50 300 is

---------19:41----------
over there so when I look at this area

---------19:44----------
this looks like so for those of you

---------19:47----------
that are not familiar with

---------19:48----------
component-level motherboard repair those

---------19:50----------
of you who are watching this video who

---------19:51----------
may not necessarily really look under a

---------19:53----------
microscope but electronics everyday just

---------19:55----------
to give you an idea what's going on here

---------19:57----------
you see these probe points over here

---------19:59----------
these are called Pro points either test

---------20:01----------
points where you can measure but these

---------20:02----------
are also points over here where with one

---------20:05----------
component is leading to another on the

---------20:07----------
board so see this is a chip this chip

---------20:10----------
has a leg and that leg is going to lead

---------20:12----------
over to something else but already now

---------20:14----------
the healthy ones are gonna look

---------20:15----------
something like this see this one over

---------20:17----------
here it's nice and shiny it's nice and

---------20:19----------
shiny there's no problem with it and the

---------20:21----------
ones that have been screwed up in some

---------20:22----------
way are going to look like this that

---------20:25----------
looks very screwed up so we're gonna see

---------20:26----------
what's going on here and we're gonna try

---------20:28----------
to fix it and see if we can get rid of

---------20:29----------
that sensor issue so the first thing I'm

---------20:31----------
gonna start by doing any when you look

---------20:32----------
in the area you also see some other

---------20:33----------
stuff that looks kind of corroded and

---------20:35----------
that's also related to the to the

---------20:37----------
voltage sense so let's go move over here

---------20:39----------
because this is you 5410 all right so

---------20:43----------
let's see on the schematic over here

---------20:45----------
alright so lets you 5410 you fifty four

---------20:49----------
ten so this is another four another

---------20:52----------
sensor and as you could see that that

---------20:55----------
thing look like junk so what we're gonna

---------20:56----------
do is we're gonna try to fix this and

---------20:58----------
we're gonna try to fix this in a

---------20:59----------
practical way so when I say practical

---------21:01----------
way what I mean is that we don't again

---------21:03----------
this machine is worth 650 to

---------21:06----------
when it works I can't replace that board

---------21:09----------
so what I have to do is I have to fix

---------21:10----------
the one that's in front of me so I'm

---------21:12----------
gonna show you how it is we do that and

---------21:13----------
that yes it is actually possible to do

---------21:15----------
these things at the when you hear them

---------21:17----------
say that you know all the people who are

---------21:19----------
doing this are full of it or they're

---------21:21----------
putting back together things that don't

---------21:22----------
work and all that kind of false

---------21:24----------
information I'm looking to prove that

---------21:25----------
wrong with this video because I again

---------21:27----------
I'm not somebody who graduated college I

---------21:30----------
actually I failed out many many times I

---------21:32----------
failed at at chemistry I had 70 averages

---------21:35----------
throughout most of my uh most of my high

---------21:38----------
school career I don't have a very steady

---------21:40----------
hand so I'm particularly bad when it

---------21:43----------
comes to any type of micro soldering I'm

---------21:45----------
really not good at it and in spite of

---------21:47----------
this I am going to repair this problem

---------21:50----------
in front of you in real time with my

---------21:52----------
camera audience and you'll see that

---------21:55----------
everything works just fine so if I can

---------21:57----------
do it then I'm confident that all of

---------21:59----------
these other technicians out there who

---------22:00----------
were much better than me that all this

---------22:02----------
stuff can do it as well and if they can

---------22:05----------
all do it then we should have the

---------22:06----------
ability to to fix these products we

---------22:10----------
should have the information available

---------22:11----------
that we need so that we can actually do

---------22:13----------
our job so that we can offer value to

---------22:15----------
the end consumer so that they don't

---------22:17----------
again just get bent over by Apple all

---------22:22----------
right so I so I'm going to get some of

---------22:26----------
these all right so we're gonna do here

---------22:32----------
is remove these effected components so

---------22:36----------
those resistors look like they're gonna

---------22:38----------
be good and honestly that transistor

---------22:40----------
over there looks like in spite of what

---------22:42----------
it looks like it's going to be good the

---------22:43----------
problem is that it's where it's going on

---------22:47----------
the bottom doesn't really give me a lot

---------22:49----------
of confidence so let me turn on my air

---------22:53----------
filter here in my hot air station get

---------22:55----------
some noise going on I usually have the

---------22:58----------
microphone closer to my mouth even

---------22:59----------
though it sounds bad and the reason for

---------23:00----------
that is more gain more better

---------23:03----------
signal-to-noise ratio so less of this

---------23:06----------
and more of me speaking I do use a lot

---------23:10----------
of tools to remove that noise but the

---------23:13----------
best way to get it out is to have lessen

---------23:15----------
the source which I do by having the

---------23:17----------
microphone in my mouth

---------23:18----------
I'm just trying something different with

---------23:19----------
this video to see if

---------23:20----------
if it out if we have the better audio

---------23:24----------
quality from the mic being further away

---------23:26----------
makes up is more important than the

---------23:32----------
noise so I'm gonna remove this component

---------23:34----------
here let's get the camera set up so you

---------23:38----------
can see a little better I'm going to

---------23:45----------
need a little bit more heat

---------23:46----------
luckily my Maya this hack ofr 801 ha de

---------23:49----------
re workstation that I have here gets

---------23:51----------
really really hot so even on these yeah

---------23:56----------
gtfo the only reason I don't trust that

---------23:59----------
is because it's directly attached over

---------24:01----------
here to an area that I don't

---------24:05----------
particularly trust so I'm going to do is

---------24:09----------
I'm gonna add some flux and some solder

---------24:21----------
you just get the proper tip

---------24:31----------
and again this is this is not even one

---------24:34----------
of the more complicated issues too many

---------24:35----------
of the people who are advanced in border

---------24:38----------
pair this is a very simple and very

---------24:40----------
common issue

---------24:52----------
all right so we're gonna tin that a

---------24:54----------
little bit it's gonna make it easier for

---------24:55----------
me to run a wire later so I'm gonna

---------25:01----------
replace that little transistor and that

---------25:04----------
transistor is part of the enable circuit

---------25:06----------
which is actually going to turn that

---------25:07----------
sensor on the whole idea is that sensor

---------25:09----------
does not have to be on all the time

---------25:10----------
it should only be on when the machine is

---------25:12----------
in an Esso state so an Esso state means

---------25:15----------
that the machine is actively on and

---------25:17----------
working as five state means that the

---------25:19----------
computer is hibernating or off as three

---------25:23----------
means that the computer is sleeping or

---------25:25----------
in suspend and Esso is when the computer

---------25:27----------
is on if you don't understand what that

---------25:29----------
means you can look up our state's as OS

---------25:31----------
3 s 5 and you'll see a lot of excellent

---------25:33----------
explanations online from computer

---------25:36----------
engineers on what the different power

---------25:37----------
states are and they'll explain it a lot

---------25:39----------
better than I am with my very

---------25:40----------
oversimplified explanation but the whole

---------25:45----------
idea here is that the sensor should only

---------25:46----------
be on when the computer is in an Esso

---------25:48----------
state and that's what this is

---------25:50----------
responsible for Friday ain't gonna say

---------26:00----------
this is the prettiest thing in the world

---------26:01----------
here yeah as I said no one have the best

---------26:06----------
soldering hands but yeah

---------26:18----------
okay now what I want to do is I want to

---------26:21----------
see where that why with edge runs to

---------26:24----------
over here so that's going to something

---------26:27----------
and I don't really trust that nasty

---------26:28----------
looking link so I'm gonna switch back to

---------26:30----------
the screen capture here so that we can

---------26:33----------
see what that is so that's P boss s oh

---------26:38----------
the sense I believe all right it cut off

---------26:42----------
over here because window scaling sucks

---------26:44----------
but if you don't have Windows 8 and

---------26:46----------
window you don't have that shitty

---------26:48----------
scaling enabled it'll be easier so let's

---------26:50----------
see so it's gonna show me where this

---------26:52----------
another piece of the software that's

---------26:53----------
useful it shows me where all these

---------26:54----------
different points show up in the board

---------26:55----------
that's supposed to be going to the other

---------26:56----------
side of the board to this resistor over

---------26:58----------
here so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

---------26:59----------
run a wire to that resistor so I'm gonna

---------27:02----------
take a wire and I'm gonna run that wire

---------27:04----------
to the other side this is this and this

---------27:12----------
is this is important because a lot of

---------27:13----------
people will say well you know Apple has

---------27:15----------
the right to not really want people

---------27:16----------
running wires across their products so

---------27:18----------
when we went to talk at the Senate

---------27:21----------
building to the assembly people on the

---------27:22----------
Senators about the right to repair bill

---------27:24----------
one of the things that was being

---------27:26----------
discussed was you know whether or not we

---------27:27----------
really have the right to do this whether

---------27:29----------
or not Apple intends for us to do this

---------27:30----------
and one of our arguments is well why

---------27:34----------
should why should it be there uh you

---------27:36----------
know why should it be up to them again

---------27:38----------
their their option what they're telling

---------27:39----------
me is that the right thing to do is to

---------27:42----------
spend $750 to replace the board because

---------27:45----------
that's what needs to be done and if you

---------27:47----------
ask the average consumer would you

---------27:49----------
rather have a wire that you cannot see

---------27:50----------
run on the inside of your product to fix

---------27:52----------
it and half the price versus paying the

---------27:55----------
manufacturer full cost to fix it but not

---------27:57----------
have that wire you're gonna notice that

---------27:59----------
a lot of consumers choose to have the

---------28:01----------
wire run because they don't want to pay

---------28:04----------
because they don't find it worth it they

---------28:06----------
simply would not go for the repair and

---------28:08----------
that's the consumers choice not anybody

---------28:12----------
else's it's not Mike it's not up to me

---------28:14----------
to make that choice for the consumer

---------28:15----------
nor is it up to Apple to make that

---------28:17----------
choice for the consumer it's up to the

---------28:19----------
consumer to make that choice for

---------28:20----------
themselves I have no right to tell

---------28:23----------
somebody what it is they should do with

---------28:25----------
what they own if what it is they're

---------28:27----------
doing is not

---------28:28----------
harming other people all right so we're

---------28:35----------
gonna solder that wire on right now so

---------28:39----------
this is a really small piece of magnet

---------28:41----------
wire that's insulated it's a very thin

---------28:43----------
piece and we're gonna put it right over

---------28:45----------
here and the unsteady hand thing really

---------28:51----------
screws with me it's very very difficult

---------28:54----------
for me to do any of this work but what

---------28:59----------
are you gonna do

---------29:06----------
I wanted to see it flat with the board's

---------29:08----------
that's why I kept going over it the wire

---------29:10----------
needs to be laying flat with the

---------29:12----------
motherboard it's very important that the

---------29:14----------
board is here you don't know why you're

---------29:15----------
doing something like this because then

---------29:17----------
if you want to break it off you just

---------29:18----------
break it and it's attached by this one

---------29:19----------
point then it goes point but if you have

---------29:21----------
it flat and you try to break it off then

---------29:23----------
you have to move the in this entire wire

---------29:25----------
versus moving it from that one little

---------29:26----------
point so that's why it's really

---------29:27----------
important to have the wire laying flat

---------29:29----------
with the board so if you're doing this

---------29:30----------
type of work very important have the

---------29:32----------
wire running flat with the motherboard

---------29:34----------
so now we're gonna go over to the area

---------29:39----------
where the resistor is on the other side

---------29:40----------
so let's find that resistor again on the

---------29:43----------
board view let's change the board view

---------29:44----------
so that it's where it's supposed to be

---------29:46----------
for me to actually aim now let's find

---------29:48----------
that little resistor so that I can see

---------29:51----------
what side is both solder juice comes out

---------29:53----------
of the right side of this resistor over

---------29:54----------
here now that is going to be because we

---------30:00----------
have

---------30:06----------
this this okay so we're going over here

---------30:09----------
so that's where my wire needs to go so

---------30:13----------
let's run the wire and we're going to

---------30:17----------
run it along the board nice and flat

---------30:28----------
to run it around something

---------30:35----------
and it has to go right over here

---------30:44----------
so I'm gonna try and cut this to perfect

---------30:47----------
length

---------31:02----------
okay now I'm gonna tin the end of the

---------31:04----------
wire it's the way I'm gonna be tending

---------31:07----------
the ends of the wire is I kind of scrape

---------31:12----------
at it with my iron so I put a little bit

---------31:13----------
of flux on the ends of the wire that I'm

---------31:22----------
gonna put some solder on my iron and

---------31:24----------
then I'm actually gonna scrape hard

---------31:27----------
against my table right at the end of

---------31:29----------
that wire so it's going to break through

---------31:33----------
the the insulation

---------31:44----------
so right at the tip I'm going to have

---------31:46----------
portion of my wire where it can ducks

---------31:49----------
electricity from the other end of the

---------31:51----------
board and I'm gonna saddle that end to

---------31:53----------
my resistor

---------32:14----------
that could have been tens better

---------32:16----------
actually I'm not happy with how that was

---------32:17----------
Tim

---------33:31----------
ultimately what I get paid for is

---------33:33----------
figuring things out I do not get paid

---------33:35----------
for manual dexterity if I got paid for

---------33:38----------
soldering or small hand movements or

---------33:40----------
anything of that nature I would be

---------33:42----------
bankrupt out of a job homeless done for

---------33:45----------
because this is not something that I am

---------33:47----------
good at why would I do what I can I'm

---------33:57----------
trying to get it to its flat with the

---------33:59----------
resistor but this is easier to do when I

---------34:01----------
have another pair of tweezers that is

---------34:03----------
not kind of broken off and nasty ideally

---------34:11----------
I would have had the insulation running

---------34:13----------
all the way up to that but such is life

---------34:18----------
so I have the wire running there now

---------34:21----------
we're gonna try to observe for any type

---------34:22----------
of other damage on the board after I

---------34:24----------
just get that wire situated exactly

---------34:25----------
where I want it

---------34:34----------
I actually have a little bit of slack

---------34:36----------
and I don't want any slack so I'm gonna

---------34:38----------
move it in I'm gonna chop off the end

---------34:49----------
all right let's moved in

---------35:02----------
so the wire now has no slack it's very

---------35:05----------
tight running along the board not tight

---------35:07----------
enough that it's gonna break things and

---------35:15----------
for those of you gonna troll and pretty

---------35:17----------
much sums right while I was working

---------35:19----------
there I was scratching this this is a

---------35:20----------
pro point for a component that's not

---------35:22----------
even attached so I mean ultimately that

---------35:24----------
that doesn't matter worth of one

---------35:26----------
bit so alrighty good to go that's the

---------35:35----------
other cool thing about am tech 559 flux

---------35:37----------
you can actually use it for a while

---------35:38----------
before it burns away so as you can see I

---------35:40----------
kept reheating there without applying

---------35:41----------
new solder so that's my jumper wire

---------35:43----------
let's jump a wire number one for a

---------35:47----------
problem and it's going from there here

---------35:54----------
route it around mr. screw hole alright

---------36:06----------
now let's take a look at the other

---------36:07----------
section right next to it you have this

---------36:10----------
this is also for a sensor what is this

---------36:14----------
see that that doesn't look very good

---------36:20----------
doesn't look very good indeed that

---------36:23----------
doesn't belong on this motherboard so

---------36:25----------
we're gonna take that off because that

---------36:26----------
looks like junk

---------36:36----------
so let's see if that trace is and that

---------36:39----------
pad is savable come on don't be stubborn

---------36:46----------
good flux okay wait for the irony heat

---------36:51----------
up

---------37:02----------
doing here is I'm kind of running the

---------37:03----------
solder over it without actually touching

---------37:05----------
the board right now just that the old

---------37:06----------
crusty corroded old lead-free solder

---------37:09----------
gets sucked up on on the balls that I

---------37:11----------
can apply let it solder so that Center

---------37:18----------
pad is gonna be a problem let's blow

---------37:21----------
away the flux that just got on the board

---------37:23----------
look you always clean that off later

---------37:36----------
do some etching here

---------37:48----------
so I'm doing them scratching away that

---------37:50----------
protective surface and now I wants have

---------37:53----------
scratched away the protective surface I

---------37:54----------
can add some flux because flux will help

---------37:56----------
clean and also help status thick and run

---------37:58----------
some side or along there that's too much

---------38:01----------
that of flux but if I care at the

---------38:03----------
moment and do this all right now what

---------38:14----------
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make myself a

---------38:16----------
little bit of an extended pad so I'm

---------38:18----------
gonna cut up a piece of battery wire

---------38:20----------
this is the wire that actually came from

---------38:22----------
the end this is a different wire it's

---------38:23----------
much thinner than the wire that I was

---------38:25----------
using before this is the wire that comes

---------38:27----------
from the inside of a battery not the

---------38:31----------
inside of a battery but it's the wire

---------38:32----------
that attaches the battery to the

---------38:34----------
computer I open up one of the individual

---------38:42----------
strands and I take a piece of wire Ingle

---------38:47----------
little piece and then I lose it because

---------38:50----------
it's really tiny so I'm going to go

---------38:52----------
ahead and cut myself off another one and

---------38:59----------
let's run that little tiny piece of wire

---------39:10----------
can I hold it thing steady for more than

---------39:13----------
a second not even close

---------39:15----------
who are we kidding

---------39:26----------
so that's gonna be my pad right there

---------39:28----------
it's crappy as it looks so let's just

---------39:32----------
get rid of the excess of this wire

---------39:48----------
there's still excess of the wire move

---------39:51----------
away some flux so I can see I lowered

---------39:54----------
the temperature of the hakko so that it

---------39:55----------
wouldn't melt the solder so it would

---------39:57----------
move the wire away all that's doing is

---------39:59----------
it's moving away a chunk okay now I'm

---------40:04----------
gonna take this move it around here

---------40:06----------
again

---------40:10----------
so this here is my pad I know it's it's

---------40:14----------
it's really it's lame it's incredibly

---------40:17----------
lame but it will have to do because it's

---------40:21----------
missed the thing is missing

---------40:32----------
you

---------40:39----------
push that down now that's still not

---------40:43----------
soldered

---------40:44----------
to where I'm happy but what the thing is

---------40:46----------
I wanted to have something that was

---------40:48----------
heavy sitting on top of it so that that

---------40:49----------
wire wouldn't move and I touched it with

---------40:51----------
my iron so one of things understand

---------40:53----------
about soldering is that the solder and

---------40:55----------
the component and the wire all that's

---------40:57----------
gonna follow the heat it's gonna want to

---------40:58----------
follow the heat source so if there is

---------41:01----------
this much wire attached to this much

---------41:04----------
trace and I put this you junk and tip on

---------41:07----------
it and I touch it that wire is gonna

---------41:08----------
stick to my tip and run away but if

---------41:11----------
there's something to hold it down like

---------41:12----------
my chip there's a chance of that not

---------41:13----------
happening so I'm going to take my finer

---------41:16----------
solder wire over here and let's just

---------41:21----------
turn this around make it a little bit

---------41:22----------
easier to work on you should always

---------41:25----------
focus on the comfort of you and not the

---------41:27----------
comfort of the device nobody cares that

---------41:29----------
the device is comfortable and we're

---------41:31----------
gonna make sure that is a good

---------41:32----------
connection the thing is well you can try

---------41:38----------
but the things in the way maybe I'll

---------41:40----------
turn it a little bit

---------41:54----------
remember on the other end that wire is

---------41:56----------
actually attached to the trace the pad

---------42:00----------
was going to that was death

---------42:10----------
not a fan of solder blobs they're so

---------42:16----------
nice try nice try no thanks

---------42:26----------
that thing is really a pain in the ass

---------42:28----------
see where it's sitting it's right in the

---------42:30----------
way

---------42:44----------
okay that's good see that now one of the

---------42:50----------
way that the things that you can it will

---------42:51----------
help you and to ensure that that is

---------42:54----------
perfectly soldered on there there's a

---------42:56----------
really good microscope I'm confident

---------42:58----------
that all those AAS Peas all those Apple

---------43:00----------
all those Apple authorized service

---------43:02----------
centers that are saying that I can't

---------43:03----------
have this diagnostic tool I'm confident

---------43:05----------
they got a 950 dollar microscope sitting

---------43:07----------
on their desk for inspection oh yeah

---------43:09----------
it's nobody else qualified to repair

---------43:11----------
these products but them right because

---------43:12----------
they are the only ones with their tools

---------43:14----------
last time you worked in them with ASP

---------43:17----------
and they had this microscope huh last

---------43:20----------
time you saw a $7,500 soldering station

---------43:22----------
as an ASP

---------43:40----------
good to go all right so I feel like that

---------43:43----------
this is ready for the testing phase so

---------43:45----------
what I want to do is I'm going to put it

---------43:46----------
back in the machine I'm gonna turn off

---------43:48----------
this really noisy rework station and air

---------43:49----------
filter because it drives me nuts

---------43:51----------
listening to it so the airfield that

---------43:53----------
rework station will turn off in a second

---------43:55----------
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna see

---------43:58----------
if it passes the Apple service test now

---------44:00----------
so with any luck this will pass the

---------44:03----------
Apple service test will pass the sensor

---------44:04----------
test that it was failing before and we

---------44:06----------
won't have an issue with it being really

---------44:07----------
slow because again the computer is

---------44:09----------
worthless when it's that slow but when

---------44:11----------
it works quickly when the sensor is

---------44:13----------
operating properly this is then worth

---------44:15----------
again six hundred fifty bucks so if we

---------44:17----------
can fix this machine for half the price

---------44:20----------
that Apple is asking then it is

---------44:22----------
worthwhile and again on price if you're

---------44:26----------
outside New York City you don't have a

---------44:29----------
lot of incentive tea again a lot of the

---------44:30----------
incentive to use us I will I will admit

---------44:33----------
is that we are local and we are fast and

---------44:36----------
we we do the job so if you live in

---------44:38----------
Brooklyn or Queens or the Bronx it may

---------44:41----------
make sense to have us do this if you

---------44:43----------
live in the middle of nowhere you can

---------44:44----------
probe a hundred percent honesty you can

---------44:47----------
find people who will fix boards for less

---------44:49----------
money than we're asking because again

---------44:50----------
yeah if you have to think about cost of

---------44:52----------
living you have to think of cost of

---------44:54----------
running a business not just cost of

---------44:56----------
living the cost of running a business in

---------44:58----------
New York is really really high compared

---------45:01----------
to other places just rent cost of living

---------45:05----------
expected salary based on the cost of

---------45:07----------
living you know there's and there are a

---------45:10----------
lot of little taxes and gotchas and all

---------45:12----------
sorts of things in New York City so

---------45:14----------
prices here are going to be more so if

---------45:17----------
you live outside of New York you can

---------45:19----------
probably find somebody who does this and

---------45:21----------
one of the reasons I'm really convinced

---------45:23----------
that I'm getting boards from all around

---------45:24----------
the world when we're in the most

---------45:26----------
expensive spot is just there are not

---------45:27----------
enough people doing this there need to

---------45:29----------
be more people doing this and there

---------45:31----------
would be more people doing this if the

---------45:33----------
proper resources were available the only

---------45:35----------
reason people are sending their

---------45:36----------
motherboards to the most expensive city

---------45:38----------
in the world to fix it is because again

---------45:39----------
it's just total lack of availability so

---------45:41----------
we are going to boot this and I want to

---------45:43----------
see and after this boots if we have a

---------45:46----------
working people tidge sensor

---------45:52----------
microphone starting to drive me nuts

---------45:53----------
this thing actually this SM 35 actually

---------45:56----------
has a much nicer looking headpiece than

---------45:59----------
the DPA 40 66 the problem is it really

---------46:01----------
kind of beats on your skull and you can

---------46:04----------
make the DPA 46 as tight as you want you

---------46:06----------
can set that thing a head crush and it's

---------46:08----------
just made in them I don't know what it

---------46:09----------
is DPA is doing it sure is not but the

---------46:11----------
4t 66 it you can have that thing set to

---------46:14----------
dis crush your skull on you and you'll

---------46:15----------
still never feel it whereas this thing

---------46:17----------
even at a loose setting it's just just

---------46:20----------
bothersome but that is the difference

---------46:22----------
between a $650 microphone and a $90

---------46:25----------
microphone so I really cannot complain

---------46:28----------
so let's see what happens when I run the

---------46:31----------
test so I'm gonna run the Apple service

---------46:33----------
test right now and let's see what I get

---------46:53----------
so we still have some failure for some

---------46:55----------
other stuff and we'll actually look into

---------46:58----------
that but see where it says P bus vp0 RP

---------47:01----------
bus over here yes of vp0 RP bus test

---------47:07----------
that this here has passed so let's see

---------47:12----------
which one failed because let's figure

---------47:13----------
out what failed and let's also fix that

---------47:15----------
problem as well so the one that fails

---------47:17----------
over here is one that's called IC zero

---------47:23----------
are computing combined cores reading

---------47:28----------
above alarm points so IC 0 are computing

---------47:31----------
let's see what that is again we want to

---------47:34----------
give back a proper device you want to

---------47:36----------
give back something income

---------47:37----------
hundred-percent working not 90% working

---------47:39----------
that 90% working is what the

---------47:41----------
places will do so let's go and look that

---------47:45----------
up before I look that up let's turn the

---------47:46----------
AC back on because it is the middle of

---------47:48----------
summer in New York and it is friggin hot

---------47:50----------
in here

---------47:51----------
alright I need my AC for to work once

---------47:55----------
the AC turns off I stopped working so IC

---------48:00----------
0 our computing

---------48:19----------
let's look at that thing again just to

---------48:20----------
see if we get any hints

---------48:33----------
so we have you 5400

---------48:44----------
and let's see what that or that is so

---------48:53----------
that's by the LCD connector let's see

---------48:54----------
what this looks like because we have an

---------48:55----------
error as related to computing sensor and

---------48:58----------
the only one that I can find for that is

---------49:00----------
in that area by the LCD connector that's

---------49:04----------
again that's another one that's really

---------49:05----------
really common I'm going to put a paper

---------49:19----------
towel on the table because that's going

---------49:20----------
to protect the machine from anything

---------49:23----------
there I clean the table very often but I

---------49:27----------
still am I'm just kind of generally

---------49:30----------
paranoid I like to keep these

---------49:31----------
commissions in the condition and that

---------49:33----------
people brought them or better so let's

---------49:36----------
see what this looks like here and is

---------49:42----------
there any real surprise that that sensor

---------49:43----------
is not reading properly when again this

---------49:46----------
is the chip that the schematic says is

---------49:47----------
responsible for that sensor and look at

---------49:50----------
it just look at it just look at it so

---------49:52----------
let's get rid of that thing and replace

---------49:56----------
it are we gonna replace it with one that

---------49:57----------
is not disgusting to make this easier to

---------50:01----------
replace what we're going to do is add

---------50:07----------
some flux

---------50:15----------
add some solder on the side of course

---------50:18----------
that means turning on the air filter

---------50:19----------
because I don't want to get any sort of

---------50:21----------
nasty health problems as a result of

---------50:23----------
breathing this in all the time so

---------50:27----------
let it solder has a lower melting point

---------50:28----------
that lead free so if you want to get

---------50:30----------
make it easier to remove something you

---------50:32----------
can just add some leaded solder so

---------50:37----------
alright so let's try to get that thing

---------50:40----------
off and replace it so that we can have a

---------50:42----------
working machine right so we've removed

---------50:49----------
the broken component so as you could see

---------50:52----------
before the legs were actually broken off

---------50:54----------
with a component completely add some

---------50:59----------
flux again you want to suck up all the

---------51:02----------
old nasty solder so we sucked up a

---------51:04----------
decent amount already

---------51:24----------
now we're going to replace that

---------51:25----------
component and yes I'm not make people

---------51:28----------
are actually calling at 10:48 on a

---------51:30----------
Friday if you think I'm answering you

---------51:34----------
out of your mind

---------51:53----------
this one looks like I don't trust

---------51:56----------
that let's get another one it's not

---------52:00----------
nice the side of things that look like

---------52:02----------
crap on a people's motherboards okay

---------52:09----------
fresh solder

---------52:30----------
and now time for a fresh chip right

---------52:36----------
cells

---------53:00----------
oh I suck at getting anything I sit

---------53:02----------
straight alright so it's down I'm still

---------53:08----------
not exactly happy with how it's down but

---------53:10----------
I also realized my own limitations in

---------53:12----------
that get in my attempts to make that

---------53:14----------
perfectly straight I will probably

---------53:16----------
destroy everything so some things must

---------53:20----------
just be lived with very least we're

---------53:22----------
going to secure it down there properly

---------53:44----------
and of course we I created a bridge

---------53:47----------
hopefully you guys will be smarter than

---------53:49----------
me and not do these stupid silly things

---------53:50----------
like creating bridges while you're

---------53:52----------
working it is my fervent hope that you

---------53:56----------
not only learn what to do from these

---------53:57----------
videos but also what not to do and that

---------54:00----------
you don't do really dumb things like

---------54:01----------
what I just did right there that's the

---------54:04----------
great thing about unedited videos is

---------54:06----------
that the camera catches everything even

---------54:07----------
you again me knocking the capacitor off

---------54:10----------
of the board like an idiot god I love it

---------54:16----------
alright so let's put that lets get

---------54:19----------
another capacitor

---------54:33----------
that capacitor almost made its trip to

---------54:36----------
the sixth dimension that's what I liked

---------54:39----------
my name for the place where all those

---------54:40----------
things go when they disappear alright so

---------54:45----------
now what I want to do is I want to try

---------54:47----------
it before um before I go over cleaning

---------54:50----------
this motherboard ultrasonically cleaning

---------54:52----------
it to get rid of all the flux and the

---------54:53----------
junk and the crap first thing we got to

---------54:55----------
do is see if it actually works because

---------54:57----------
there's no point to cleaning it before

---------54:58----------
we see that it turns on and functions so

---------55:02----------
I'm going to turn it on I'm gonna go

---------55:03----------
back to that test and I want to see if

---------55:05----------
it passes and if all the sensors work

---------55:06----------
this time if this thing doesn't pass I

---------55:13----------
haven't done my job and now we wait I

---------55:23----------
have this stuff on an SSD because I

---------55:26----------
don't have the patience to wait I don't

---------55:29----------
like waiting for hard drives I hate

---------55:31----------
waiting for hard drives I'm sure many of

---------55:33----------
you guys do as well that's why you all

---------55:35----------
own Apple products because Apple

---------55:38----------
products at this specific point in time

---------55:40----------
that I'm filming this video not when I'm

---------55:41----------
uploading it but when I'm filming it you

---------55:43----------
guys apples got some of the fastest SSDs

---------55:46----------
inside of a consumer product key word

---------55:48----------
consumer they're like you spend a

---------55:50----------
thousand bucks on a laptop and this is

---------55:52----------
the SSD that you're getting it is just

---------55:54----------
ridiculous so as you can see here I have

---------55:56----------
a perfect rating of past so all the

---------55:59----------
sensors work so let's just ground I'm

---------56:01----------
not sure how visible that's gonna be to

---------56:03----------
you hold that's all right so we're gonna

---------56:07----------
go over here and scroll so let's see

---------56:12----------
which are the ones that were failing

---------56:13----------
before can I scroll on this so and I

---------56:16----------
have to use the stupid friggin bar

---------56:18----------
alright

---------56:19----------
I missed the ThinkPad I need my middle

---------56:21----------
mouse button I'm lost without my middle

---------56:23----------
mouse button so we had I see zero R that

---------56:30----------
was messed up I see zero R so that

---------56:33----------
passed see over here I see zero r IC 0 R

---------56:41----------
that was the one that failed before and

---------56:43----------
let's go and find vp0 R

---------56:50----------
VP 0r I got a scroll down a little more

---------56:54----------
regain the sensor reads with an

---------56:56----------
operating range I have to hope I can

---------56:59----------
find my way back to whatever focus I had

---------57:01----------
to set to before

---------57:10----------
it's not

---------57:24----------
so as can be seen here I fixed my

---------57:27----------
problem so we had a problem with the

---------57:28----------
motherboard of the computer which is a

---------57:30----------
piece of the machine that Apple says is

---------57:32----------
not serviceable it's a part that they

---------57:34----------
say that you cannot fix and not only did

---------57:37----------
I show you exactly how it is you can fix

---------57:39----------
it in under one hour of time but I'm

---------57:42----------
also somebody who barely has control of

---------57:44----------
my hands and I'm doing this very small

---------57:46----------
micro soldering of connecting these

---------57:48----------
interconnecting these tiny components of

---------57:50----------
figuring out what's going on in under an

---------57:52----------
hour it is it is absolutely possible to

---------57:55----------
do this there is no reason that the only

---------57:57----------
solution to these types of problems

---------57:59----------
would be to pay the manufacturer of the

---------58:01----------
product $750 to fix it particularly

---------58:04----------
again when this machine is worth 650

---------58:07----------
with that newer retina that newer retina

---------58:10----------
has a resale value of around 1000 to

---------58:12----------
$1,100

---------58:13----------
the arguing can be made that you would

---------58:15----------
be buying that computer for more than

---------58:17----------
the cost of repair so the $750 option is

---------58:19----------
an option that's worth considering and

---------58:21----------
there I will contend that the $750

---------58:23----------
option is an option that is worth

---------58:26----------
considering but awesome what I'll argue

---------58:28----------
is that you should have another option

---------58:31----------
and how many aspects of our life do we

---------58:33----------
as consumers have literally one option

---------58:35----------
for something there shouldn't be and

---------58:37----------
there should be many options there

---------58:38----------
should be so many people other than me

---------58:40----------
out there doing this that it's

---------58:41----------
ridiculous and there or not there are a

---------58:43----------
handful of a few hundred people out

---------58:46----------
there that do this and that's it and

---------58:48----------
it's because you have to do the again

---------58:51----------
you know to do this dumpster diving to

---------58:52----------
find the tools dumpster diving to find

---------58:54----------
the parts you know there are a lot of

---------58:56----------
these small pieces where I can't simply

---------58:58----------
go to mouse or digi-key and buy them my

---------59:01----------
only option is to buy boards that have

---------59:03----------
holes in them and take them off of

---------59:04----------
boards with holes in them and that's

---------59:06----------
just you know something I feel like

---------59:08----------
doing again with the SMC chips with all

---------59:10----------
with a lot of these small chips that go

---------59:12----------
on these boards they come with

---------59:13----------
programming and we can't program them so

---------59:15----------
you have to rig and that's not gonna

---------59:17----------
stop me don't get it twisted you you you

---------59:19----------
make it harder to repair this product

---------59:20----------
I'm not gonna stop fixing it I'm gonna

---------59:23----------
find a way to repair these products

---------59:24----------
whether they like it or not it's just a

---------59:27----------
question of whether it's gonna be easy

---------59:28----------
it's just a question of whether you're

---------59:30----------
gonna make it convenient for the

---------59:31----------
consumer it's a question of whether it's

---------59:33----------
gonna take me four days to find the

---------59:35----------
sensor that's wrong on that machine

---------59:36----------
which I'm by the way I'm guessing it's

---------59:37----------
trackpad

---------59:38----------
because trackpad usually shares the bus

---------59:39----------
with the camera and they said that the

---------59:41----------
camera is something I should check so

---------59:43----------
I'm gonna follow up on that but I'm 99%

---------59:45----------
sure it's a it's something on the

---------59:47----------
trackpad line pulling it down but I

---------59:48----------
digress

---------59:49----------
I'm gonna figure that out whether you

---------59:51----------
make the tools available or not rest

---------59:52----------
assured I will figure it out it's just a

---------59:54----------
question of whether or not I am able to

---------59:55----------
provide the best experience possible to

---------59:57----------
the consumer and the consumer is here

---------59:59----------
because they're clearly not satisfied

---------60:00----------
with the experience that I had with you

---------60:02----------
when you told them we'll be 750 bucks to

---------60:04----------
repair a computer that's worth very

---------60:05----------
little more than that they're already

---------60:07----------
not gonna have a good experience with

---------60:08----------
you at the very least you should allow

---------60:10----------
them to have a good experience with me

---------60:11----------
with your own product because will allow

---------60:13----------
your product to have a more positive

---------60:15----------
impression on the world so if I can fix

---------60:17----------
that product in three hours versus two

---------60:19----------
to four days the customer will be

---------60:20----------
happier overall when they look at this

---------60:23----------
Apple laptop versus looking at it and

---------60:24----------
thinking man I was without this thing

---------60:26----------
for two to four days and you know

---------60:29----------
what I'm trying to get across with this

---------60:30----------
video I'm not the ultimate idea here

---------60:33----------
it's not a message of hatred it's not a

---------60:35----------
message of anger even though in some

---------60:37----------
ways I am irritated am i I am angry what

---------60:39----------
I'm trying to do here is I want people

---------60:41----------
to realize that this that is happening

---------60:45----------
is wrong and I'm hoping that if enough

---------60:47----------
people realize that it's wrong and

---------60:49----------
enough people comment on why it's wrong

---------60:51----------
and enough people think that it's wrong

---------60:52----------
that third party repair centers cannot

---------60:55----------
have access to Diagnostics it's wrong

---------60:57----------
that third party repair centers will

---------60:59----------
destroy your phone by replacing a five

---------61:02----------
to ten dollar home button no joke again

---------61:04----------
your finger is wet because you just wash

---------61:06----------
your hands you accidentally press your

---------61:08----------
home button you got to go to Apple and

---------61:10----------
pay 300 bucks because they will not

---------61:13----------
allow me to replace the button like I

---------61:15----------
replace the home button on your phone

---------61:17----------
and for absolutely no reason one day

---------61:19----------
when you go to update it without warning

---------61:21----------
the will die and like this is this

---------61:24----------
is an injustice and I and what I want

---------61:26----------
people to realize is that this is an

---------61:28----------
injustice before it continues to get

---------61:30----------
worse and worse and worse because the

---------61:32----------
way we got ourselves into these problems

---------61:33----------
is it happens a little bit at a time and

---------61:35----------
a little bit at a time and a little bit

---------61:36----------
at a time

---------61:37----------
and Aries we don't really care we don't

---------61:39----------
really notice but just a little bit each

---------61:40----------
time and then eventually we get to a

---------61:42----------
point where we're completely and

---------61:44----------
I don't want to be at a point where

---------61:46----------
we're completely I want to kind

---------61:47----------
of try to turn back the clock I want to

---------61:49----------
turn back and try the entrance you know

---------61:50----------
some type of

---------61:52----------
national solution for this entire

---------61:53----------
problem before we get to the point where

---------61:55----------
it completely screwed and if this

---------61:57----------
doesn't wind up being a business where

---------61:58----------
we're completely screwed well you know

---------62:00----------
you're gonna see me installing a lot

---------62:02----------
more security cameras and fixing a lot

---------62:04----------
less apple motherboards that's about it

---------62:06----------
for today you know and before before the

---------62:11----------
I ended for today you know people always

---------62:13----------
ask me so why is it that you're so

---------62:15----------
interested in this new security business

---------62:16----------
why are you so interested in installing

---------62:18----------
alarms or installing camera systems when

---------62:21----------
you when you when you're doing all the

---------62:22----------
stuff with the motherboards and this is

---------62:24----------
really it I buy a camera from from

---------62:26----------
manufacturer they will support it they

---------62:29----------
will tell me how to use their software

---------62:31----------
if I have an issue with a DVR it's not

---------62:33----------
like like I'm I don't have to go through

---------62:35----------
a box of broken DVRs to service your DVR

---------62:39----------
I don't have to don't like to like to

---------62:41----------
find somebody who doesn't speak English

---------62:43----------
and ask them if they have any of

---------62:46----------
something that they've took off the back

---------62:47----------
of a truck somewhere it's to get myself

---------62:50----------
well you know a little door alarm

---------62:51----------
because I can just buy it from the

---------62:53----------
manufacturer who will support their

---------62:54----------
product who are ok with me working with

---------62:56----------
their product it's not like this

---------62:58----------
business where you're constantly working

---------63:00----------
against people who are actively seeking

---------63:02----------
to destroy your profession who are

---------63:04----------
actively seeking to destroy the actions

---------63:06----------
you're taking this is why I am looking

---------63:08----------
to move away from the business of laptop

---------63:11----------
repair in general because again you're

---------63:13----------
not working with people who support you

---------63:15----------
you're working with people who are

---------63:16----------
trying to you at every turn and in

---------63:18----------
spite of working with people who are

---------63:19----------
trying to me at every turn actually

---------63:21----------
pretty good at it to the point of again

---------63:23----------
15,000 subscribers on YouTube a class

---------63:26----------
being taught on and all sorts of cool

---------63:27----------
stuff can you imagine what it would be

---------63:29----------
like if we were supported by the

---------63:31----------
manufacturer can you imagine how much

---------63:32----------
better the content would be on this

---------63:33----------
channel if we actually add support from

---------63:36----------
the people making these products you

---------63:38----------
know would be pretty cool
