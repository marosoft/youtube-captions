---------00:00----------
today we're going to be working on

---------00:01----------
another MacBook this is an a 1708

---------00:04----------
MacBook this is a non touch bar so USBC

---------00:07----------
13-inch MacBook Pro it appears to be

---------00:11----------
having issues due to liquid damage let's

---------00:13----------
open up the bottom of the case and see

---------00:15----------
what it looks like on the inside so if

---------00:17----------
we look inside this MacBook it doesn't

---------00:19----------
look too bad

---------00:20----------
it has minor corrosion over here and it

---------00:24----------
has some corrosion by the backlight

---------00:26----------
circuit and it has some coercion by the

---------00:28----------
TPS five one nine eight zero if I had to

---------00:31----------
guess the lethal corrosion killing this

---------00:33----------
MacBook is not going to be the backlight

---------00:35----------
circuit is not going to be this stuff by

---------00:37----------
the trackpad it's going to be what's by

---------00:39----------
the TPS five four nine eight zero the

---------00:42----------
TPS five one nine nine zero is gonna be

---------00:44----------
responsible for your 3.3 volt rail your

---------00:47----------
5 volt s5 rail and your 5 volt as for

---------00:50----------
rail without these rails the machine

---------00:52----------
will not work or turn on they are the

---------00:54----------
most integral rails in contrast to the

---------00:57----------
backlight and the stuff by the trackpad

---------00:59----------
because who really gives a crap about

---------01:00----------
the trackpad you don't need a trackpad

---------01:02----------
what you need is a trackball

---------01:04----------
I don't care if this machine is a

---------01:05----------
trackpad when I'm done I could care less

---------01:07----------
because when I'm done with this I'm

---------01:09----------
going to give the customer a trackball

---------01:11----------
and if they don't want a trackball they

---------01:14----------
clearly don't have taste and they have

---------01:16----------
no business being my customer so let's

---------01:19----------
go on and take this board out of the

---------01:20----------
machine and see what it is that this

---------01:22----------
board is doing

---------01:31----------
I can't reach anything in there look at

---------01:33----------
this the amount of space from my iron is

---------01:35----------
non-existent I can't even touch that

---------01:37----------
stuff up like the t30 can will not even

---------01:40----------
fit in there wow that's crazy

---------01:51----------
I think there's a backlight sense line

---------01:53----------
there that went out

---------02:00----------
yeah I see a broken feedback mount

---------02:04----------
feedback current sensing trace there

---------02:21----------
all right so the issue here we're gonna

---------02:24----------
have is no backlight and as can be seen

---------02:26----------
here this probe point that's missing

---------02:28----------
this is for gonna be back like current

---------02:30----------
sensing so if I look up you 8,400 and we

---------02:32----------
look up in 9 on the chip this is going

---------02:35----------
to this resistor over here and this is a

---------02:38----------
current sense resistor there's gonna be

---------02:40----------
a really low voltage drop across this

---------02:42----------
resistor and the voltage drop across the

---------02:44----------
resistor is going to be proportional to

---------02:45----------
the amount of current that the system is

---------02:47----------
using so this over here is going to be a

---------02:52----------
current sensing circuit so if this trace

---------02:55----------
is destroyed if pin 9 is totally broken

---------03:01----------
then it's going to see a permanent

---------03:04----------
voltage drop because you can have eight

---------03:05----------
volt here or 12 volts here and zero

---------03:07----------
volts there so it's got to turn off the

---------03:10----------
back light circuit and a result of

---------03:12----------
turning off the back light circuit it's

---------03:14----------
gonna be no backlight and if there's no

---------03:17----------
backlight then the computer is gonna

---------03:20----------
wind up in my cube so let's take a look

---------03:23----------
at that let's see if we can bring that

---------03:26----------
back to where it was before so we're

---------03:28----------
gonna have to find out where this goes

---------03:29----------
and run a little jumper wire inside the

---------03:34----------
board

---------04:06----------
all right so let's see what pin 9

---------04:08----------
supposed to connect to that's going to a

---------04:12----------
resistor on the other side of the board

---------04:15----------
oh boy that's gonna be quite the jumper

---------04:18----------
water ok so we got to run a jumper wire

---------04:21----------
to the other side of the board this

---------04:24----------
seems like a great job to do tomorrow

---------04:49----------
Louis why you still at work I am still

---------04:51----------
at work because there are map books that

---------04:53----------
need to be fixed

---------05:04----------
all right so we're gonna solder a new

---------05:06----------
LED driver on here and then run a wire

---------05:10----------
to the other side

---------05:19----------
okay so we had a little bit of flux now

---------05:25----------
we are going to get a new LED driver

---------05:28----------
chip which by the way if you need a new

---------05:31----------
LED driver chip you can find them at

---------05:33----------
store Dodd rossmann group.com

---------06:42----------
all right

---------07:22----------
all right so now it's time to get that

---------07:25----------
current sensing wire running which ones

---------07:27----------
do you like flat like wiggle wiggle and

---------07:29----------
which ones do you gently press down on

---------07:30----------
them I gently press down on QFN packages

---------07:38----------
where I can see all the connections and

---------07:40----------
I wiggle wiggle the ones that are ball

---------07:42----------
grid array meaning there's balls

---------07:44----------
everywhere it's not just on connections

---------07:46----------
on the outside so we have to run a wire

---------07:49----------
from the side of the board to the other

---------07:52----------
yeah don't see a via here

---------08:02----------
or is there is there a nub oh knob yes

---------08:10----------
yes knob

---------08:12----------
show me the nub bye now bye don't mean

---------08:16----------
noob boo

---------08:24----------
please tell me that's not a ground plane

---------08:35----------
mmm

---------08:41----------
oh I see you I see you can I even solder

---------08:46----------
to you or you're just gonna break in a

---------08:47----------
piece as a second I touch you there we

---------08:52----------
go

---------10:17----------
there we go so we dug we found the nub

---------10:21----------
and now let's see if this has a

---------10:23----------
backlight on its screen

---------10:36----------
let's see if it works someone said that

---------10:39----------
is an awesome repair we don't know if

---------10:41----------
it's fixed this could still be a dead

---------10:44----------
pile of junk let's see if this works

---------10:47----------
yeah 30 to 60 milliamps alright this one

---------10:51----------
will have to wait until tomorrow I am

---------10:54----------
getting tired running out of steam so

---------10:57----------
we're gonna work on this one tomorrow

---------10:58----------
when I'm fresh I have been streaming for

---------11:01----------
five and a half hours now let's get

---------11:05----------
started on this MacBook so we were

---------11:07----------
working on this one yesterday remember

---------11:09----------
so see what we did here we ran a wire to

---------11:14----------
that little via look at that look at

---------11:20----------
that I was hoping that would be good but

---------11:24----------
after we were done with all that the

---------11:26----------
thing I didn't even want to turn on so

---------11:28----------
now let's take a look at the TPS five or

---------11:30----------
nine eight zero area now keep in mind

---------11:32----------
this was actually turning on prior to us

---------11:34----------
running this jumper over here so I like

---------11:37----------
to look back to the last thing I did

---------11:39----------
before something stopped working so I

---------11:41----------
ran a jumper to where I thought back

---------11:44----------
like current sensing was there's a

---------11:45----------
chance that that when I dug into the

---------11:47----------
board that what I was actually hitting

---------11:48----------
was ground so first thing I want to do

---------11:50----------
here is see if PP bus g-3 hot is shorted

---------11:53----------
to ground and it is but it wasn't short

---------11:58----------
at the ground prior so this was not

---------12:01----------
shorted to ground prior to me running

---------12:03----------
this jumper wire so I'm gonna unsolder

---------12:05----------
this jumper wire that I ran yesterday

---------12:06----------
for what I thought was back like current

---------12:09----------
sensing

---------12:15----------
okay now let's see if we're still short

---------12:18----------
it's a ground on pipi bus g3 hot

---------12:22----------
we're not yesterday when I ran that wire

---------12:25----------
I thought I was running it to the via

---------12:27----------
for backlight output but that view is

---------12:29----------
destroyed and when I dug into the board

---------12:30----------
to try and find the nub what I actually

---------12:32----------
found was ground so I wired my backlight

---------12:35----------
circuit directly to ground

---------12:36----------
great job dumbass so let me show you

---------12:39----------
what was going on here so here we have

---------12:42----------
the backlight circuit and on these

---------12:43----------
machines Apple decided to give people a

---------12:45----------
break on these constantly burning LCD

---------12:48----------
connectors and destroyed fuses by and

---------12:51----------
burned up boards by putting a current

---------12:53----------
sensing circuit in this is a resistor

---------12:56----------
that has a really low resistance and the

---------12:59----------
backlight driver over here is going to

---------13:01----------
measure the voltage at the beginning and

---------13:04----------
the end of that resistor if it sees that

---------13:07----------
there's a big voltage difference it's

---------13:08----------
going to assume that the system is using

---------13:10----------
a lot of current and then this

---------13:11----------
transistor is going to turn itself off

---------13:13----------
because there's a short to ground

---------13:14----------
somewhere or it's using too much current

---------13:16----------
to keep it from blowing up or doing

---------13:19----------
something bad this over here is my pp

---------13:24----------
bus g3 hot backlight input and what I

---------13:27----------
did because I'm a dumbass is I actually

---------13:31----------
soldered this straight to ground so I

---------13:35----------
thought that when this nub was broken

---------13:38----------
what I thought I was doing is I thought

---------13:40----------
that when I dug a little bit that I

---------13:41----------
found the nub and then I soldered it to

---------13:43----------
it but I didn't I actually soldered it

---------13:45----------
to ground right inside the board no good

---------13:49----------
so what I'm going to have to do before

---------13:52----------
hopefully before I throw up since I'm

---------13:54----------
not feel oh oh okay shouldn't I said

---------13:58----------
that what I have to do here is run that

---------14:01----------
wire to the other side of the board

---------14:03----------
which I was hoping to avoid doing that's

---------14:05----------
not going to be fun so let's go ahead

---------14:07----------
and see where this goes so that pin on

---------14:10----------
the LED backlight driver is going to be

---------14:14----------
pin nine and you're going to the other

---------14:19----------
side of the board and that's going to be

---------14:22----------
going down here to this

---------14:26----------
pen which is right here so that's where

---------14:31----------
this wire is gonna have to go okay we

---------14:35----------
can do that that shouldn't be too

---------14:36----------
difficult and hopefully after we do that

---------14:39----------
we have LCD backlight

---------14:52----------
okay so we're gonna take this wire and

---------14:56----------
place it on this MacBook

---------15:06----------
let's try to either's next oh boy

---------15:10----------
the nauseousness is coming uh-oh must

---------15:16----------
fix MacBook cannot get nauseous MacBook

---------15:21----------
is not fixed yet cannot throw up on

---------15:25----------
MacBook

---------15:32----------
would like to throw up on MacBook

---------15:54----------
okay now we turn this around and this

---------15:59----------
wire is gonna have to make its way

---------16:01----------
around the board to this area over here

---------16:11----------
we're gonna run this wire around here

---------16:15----------
this is so not this is this is gonna be

---------16:19----------
bad or Jesus I have no trust in this

---------16:28----------
wire

---------16:31----------
okay and we're gonna run this all the

---------16:34----------
way to that pad

---------16:43----------
first we're going to see if this turns

---------16:45----------
on but the amperage it takes then we're

---------16:48----------
going to see what it outputs to a screen

---------16:49----------
if anything

---------17:04----------
all right so we're taking 600 ml amps so

---------17:07----------
this machine is capable of turning on

---------17:10----------
now we're going to see if it produces a

---------17:12----------
picture on the screen okay so we're

---------17:15----------
gonna plug this in and see if we get an

---------17:17----------
image or a question mark folder I'm

---------17:19----------
shooting for a question mark folder here

---------17:21----------
so let's see what voltage we get on

---------17:22----------
backlight output all right so it appears

---------17:24----------
that this now appears to have a question

---------17:29----------
mark folder which means that we have

---------17:31----------
fixed our issue so we had two issues on

---------17:34----------
this MacBook that I'm gonna go over so

---------17:38----------
the first issue that we had on this

---------17:39----------
MacBook was that the three volt and the

---------17:42----------
5 volt rails were not working properly

---------17:43----------
due to their being corrosion around the

---------17:46----------
TPS 500/0 chip and if we look here

---------17:49----------
you'll see this was where we originally

---------17:52----------
had our corrosion around the TPS 5:09

---------17:55----------
8-0 IC the second issue that we had was

---------17:58----------
a backlight issue we had corrosion

---------18:00----------
around you 8400 u 8400 is the backlight

---------18:05----------
chip now what I did here I thought that

---------18:08----------
what I could do is fix the current

---------18:10----------
sensing circuit because pin 9 over here

---------18:13----------
is where the corrosion was this vo is

---------18:15----------
broken right here and this is a current

---------18:19----------
sensing circuit the way a current

---------18:21----------
sensing circuit works is this going to

---------18:22----------
be a current sensing resistor over here

---------18:25----------
and there is going to be a small voltage

---------18:29----------
drop across it the voltage drop across

---------18:31----------
the current sensing resistor I will not

---------18:34----------
go home I have MacBooks to fix my fever

---------18:37----------
will get better when I fix my MacBook

---------18:39----------
the more of a voltage drop there is from

---------18:41----------
this side of the resistor to this side

---------18:42----------
of the resistor the more current is

---------18:43----------
going through it now

---------18:44----------
between here and here this was broken

---------18:48----------
and since that was broken this

---------18:50----------
transistor is never going to open

---------18:51----------
because if it thinks that there's 12

---------18:53----------
volts here and 0 volts here it's gonna

---------18:55----------
think oh my god we're using millions and

---------18:56----------
millions of amps this is never going to

---------18:58----------
turn on so I tried to find the nub where

---------19:02----------
I could attach this to this I tried to

---------19:04----------
do what it is March Schaefer and Jesse

---------19:06----------
Jones do it iPad rehab very often which

---------19:08----------
is find the nub because sometimes if you

---------19:10----------
scrape down into the board a little bit

---------19:12----------
you can find the nub and that's what I

---------19:14----------
did here and I thought that I found the

---------19:16----------
nub I thought I found it you could see

---------19:18----------
where there is a nub you see this little

---------19:21----------
it looks like a set of eyes over here so

---------19:23----------
this is where this current sensing one's

---------19:25----------
going this is where this current sensing

---------19:27----------
one is going and that was not actually

---------19:31----------
enough that over there

---------19:33----------
was ground I dug a little too much

---------19:36----------
either that or it wasn't that I dug a

---------19:38----------
little too much it was that the probe

---------19:39----------
point was likely damaged entirely so we

---------19:42----------
ran a wire to that point and I tried to

---------19:44----------
run the wire at the same direction as

---------19:47----------
the trace and the board said the trace

---------19:49----------
and the board was going like this I

---------19:50----------
don't want to have a wire going like

---------19:51----------
this because then you have a very small

---------19:53----------
teeny tiny point where they cross where

---------19:55----------
you have connection I wanted the wire to

---------19:57----------
be running like this right over it so

---------20:00----------
that it would have make a better

---------20:02----------
connection and be stronger so you can

---------20:04----------
see that this V this trace is going up

---------20:06----------
into the right and the wire is running

---------20:09----------
along it as well we are going to Rio

---------20:11----------
sonic this board to get rid of that

---------20:13----------
corrosion over there not corrosion that

---------20:15----------
the flux residue and all that

---------20:17----------
I'm gonna run use some of that green uvh

---------20:19----------
nine-hundred stuff available at story

---------20:21----------
dot Russman group.com don't delay buy

---------20:24----------
some green UV curing mask at everyday

---------20:26----------
low prices on stored rossmann group comm

---------20:29----------
today and after that this machine should

---------20:33----------
be good to go back on the way to the

---------20:34----------
customer and hopefully they'll stop

---------20:38----------
calling me and asking me for status

---------20:40----------
updates while I'm sitting here with a

---------20:42----------
102 fever so I am going to take some

---------20:45----------
more vitamin C water over here drink it

---------20:48----------
and then we're gonna move on to the next

---------20:50----------
macbook vitamin c water your health is

---------20:59----------
more important than manic books

---------21:01----------
I wish unfortunately I have one purpose

---------21:03----------
in life it is to fix MacBooks
