---------00:00----------
so today we're going to be working on a

---------00:01----------
machine that has intermittent graphics

---------00:04----------
so sometimes you get the graphics and at

---------00:06----------
other times you don't get any graphics

---------00:08----------
and this is an older MacBook this is a

---------00:10----------
2010 17-inch MacBook Pro now a lot of

---------00:14----------
people like these 2010 MacBook Pros

---------00:16----------
because they have the 17 inch screen

---------00:19----------
apples stop giving you a 17 inch screen

---------00:21----------
in 2011 and the 2011 model as I've said

---------00:24----------
many times as those rampant GPU failures

---------00:26----------
so they're completely useless so if you

---------00:28----------
want a 17 inch Mac you have the 2010 and

---------00:30----------
the 2009 is an option so let's just show

---------00:34----------
what this thing's doing if we turn it on

---------00:36----------
so this is MacBook and it's giving a

---------00:40----------
screen but if you tap it it stops giving

---------00:44----------
you a screen see now it's a black screen

---------00:49----------
so every now and then you get a screen

---------00:51----------
and sometimes you don't get a screen now

---------00:53----------
what I see is very common with these

---------00:55----------
machines is that people will try to

---------00:57----------
reflow the graphics chip when they have

---------00:59----------
this issue but what you have to remember

---------01:01----------
is that this machine has two graphics

---------01:03----------
cards it has the Intel built-in graphics

---------01:05----------
trip into the i-5 of the i7 processor

---------01:08----------
and also the GPU so if you get no video

---------01:10----------
at all and it's random like that it

---------01:12----------
isn't necessarily your graphics card

---------01:14----------
that's bad so I'm gonna switch over to

---------01:15----------
the schematic here and go over a theory

---------01:18----------
with you while also showing you what you

---------01:20----------
should check on these older boards and

---------01:22----------
even on some of the new ones actually

---------01:23----------
because I do believe they still use

---------01:24----------
muxing circuits which is something

---------01:27----------
called the LVDS MUX and on new machines

---------01:30----------
it's called the EDP or DisplayPort MUX

---------01:32----------
on here this is you 9600 so if we look

---------01:35----------
at this document you'll see that we have

---------01:37----------
two different graphics cards we have the

---------01:40----------
graphics card that's built into the CPU

---------01:41----------
which is you know which speaks with the

---------01:44----------
PCH and then we have the nvidia graphics

---------01:49----------
up here so the nvidia graphics will

---------01:52----------
speak to something called the MUX and

---------01:54----------
then the Intel graphics also speaks to

---------01:56----------
the MUX before it goes to the LCD

---------01:59----------
connector so in order for you to get a

---------02:02----------
switching graphics it has to go through

---------02:04----------
this chip before it gets to the LCD

---------02:05----------
connector it's not like the Intel

---------02:07----------
internal graphics and the NVIDIA

---------02:08----------
internal graphics both connect directly

---------02:10----------
to the LCD connector that wouldn't make

---------02:12----------
any sense that wouldn't work

---------02:13----------
so you have a chip that sits in between

---------02:15----------
it so let's see what happens when you

---------02:16----------
tap that chip on the board so right now

---------02:22----------
we have screen oh now it's gonna stay on

---------02:26----------
yeah go figure there you go so when you

---------02:28----------
tap it that's what happens now this is a

---------02:31----------
very very it's a compact chip and it

---------02:35----------
typically sits right underneath the PCH

---------02:37----------
which is a very well heat sink area so

---------02:39----------
it's a bit difficult to reflow but what

---------02:41----------
you could this is not a flip chip design

---------02:43----------
it's very similar to an SMC so you can

---------02:45----------
actually fix this often with a reflow

---------02:48----------
but if you reflow the GPU it will not

---------02:51----------
fix this problem it'll just add to the

---------02:53----------
destruction of the of the GPU because

---------02:57----------
you're putting it through a thermal

---------02:58----------
cycle it doesn't need and the MUX will

---------03:00----------
still be a problematic so let's see what

---------03:02----------
happens if you reflow the MUX on this

---------03:03----------
board and if it fixes the problem I'm

---------03:06----------
confident that since Paul soldering is

---------03:08----------
10 times better than mine it's a good

---------03:09----------
just fine now one thing that you have to

---------03:11----------
be careful about with this is you have

---------03:12----------
to make sure that you get rid of all the

---------03:14----------
edge bonding because if there's any edge

---------03:15----------
bonding under there it's going to

---------03:17----------
combine with the balls now the SMC uses

---------03:19----------
0.3 to 0.35 millimeter balls this chip

---------03:23----------
uses point 2 to 0.25 millimeter balls

---------03:25----------
that are very close together so with the

---------03:28----------
SMC you can get away with having a

---------03:29----------
little bit of edge bonding in there but

---------03:31----------
with this if you have any edge bonding

---------03:32----------
that gets under the chip you're never

---------03:34----------
ever ever going to get that fixed

---------03:37----------
without reball in the chip and with that

---------03:43----------
I will leave you to our main man Paul

---------03:47----------
and I left a bunch of bonding under it

---------03:52----------
do they actually have squares around the

---------03:55----------
chip yes they my Woodyard belongs

---------03:57----------
that's insane I did but edge bonding did

---------04:02----------
not come out cleanly so I'm gonna have

---------04:03----------
to grab an exacto knife and get it out

---------04:05----------
from underneath it maybe I can get this

---------04:09----------
side to come out cleanly

---------04:13----------
it's a very fine line between not enough

---------04:16----------
heat and too much heat for this edge

---------04:17----------
bonding someone come off with no problem

---------04:20----------
others ripped to shreds

---------04:38----------
see now I'm wondering if it even went

---------04:39----------
underneath the chip cuz that one came

---------04:41----------
off the same way well if they tilt it up

---------04:44----------
and see if it's still underneath the

---------04:45----------
chip where's my check there's my chip

---------04:48----------
okay we got a little piece down there

---------04:57----------
let's just clean that out a little bit

---------05:03----------
yeah it all came out let's do the other

---------05:07----------
corners

---------05:35----------
hi hi hi hi hi hi how are you hi

---------06:16----------
or he

---------06:33----------
mm rj45 cable 'z today mm-hmm I used to

---------06:37----------
work for Lucent Technologies and I sat

---------06:40----------
there

---------06:40----------
terminating BNC connectors for an entire

---------06:43----------
week one time at a central office

---------06:55----------
well this isn't my microscope this is

---------06:57----------
Louis's bench then I'm on my bench is

---------07:00----------
occupied by a obnoxious data recovery

---------07:03----------
for the entire or damn day

---------07:05----------
now let's reflow this thing so I have my

---------07:09----------
temperature at max my air at max and the

---------07:11----------
biggest nozzle on the quick that we have

---------07:17----------
I've been told that this is going to

---------07:19----------
take a lot of heat to get this thing to

---------07:21----------
move

---------07:53----------
and that is dancing dance little chip

---------07:56----------
dance oh that's all mixed up now find a

---------08:05----------
q-tip give this an SMC rapid cool even

---------08:11----------
though it's amongst

---------08:23----------
okay so how was reflow reflow was easy

---------08:26----------
huh it was it was as expected look at

---------08:31----------
all that stuff on the board that tells

---------08:32----------
the Machine what wait till that's done

---------08:39----------
come no I want a quick made quick work

---------08:43----------
of it

---------08:43----------
beautiful okay let's see if it works is

---------08:47----------
it cool it is cool now I have to see if

---------08:53----------
it works

---------08:54----------
Logan battery I do want to switch the

---------08:56----------
overhead camera yep

---------09:03----------
scary moment see if you had a stream

---------09:06----------
deck I would know which button to push

---------09:08----------
it's obviously f7 obviously I'm gonna

---------09:13----------
put a label on that camera f7

---------09:27----------
chime lights alright now if we tap the

---------09:30----------
board do we still have the intermittency

---------09:31----------
from before HD tap about phrase oh no

---------09:38----------
tap point two millimeter balls tap tap

---------09:41----------
and like moving the case around a little

---------09:43----------
tap tap tap tap tap flex flex flex we

---------09:48----------
look at how much flex this MacBook has

---------09:50----------
God Jesus Christ unibody baby aluminum

---------09:58----------
is better than plastic don't you know

---------10:00----------
oak oh yeah it gets warm it's a mech

---------10:05----------
yeah there you go

---------10:08----------
LDS MUX not enough so please please stop

---------10:15----------
Reef lowing the GPUs please reflow a GPU

---------10:18----------
is not effects reef lowing a little MUX

---------10:20----------
maybe a fix is that your first MUX

---------10:24----------
that's my first 2010 bucks huh it's all

---------10:28----------
mucked up now it usually takes at least

---------10:32----------
five years for that for the Vols under

---------10:34----------
that's a crack so you're probably not

---------10:35----------
gonna get those repairs besides older

---------10:36----------
models but they do use that same MUX

---------10:39----------
idea on everything up to the newest one

---------10:42----------
and on the newest one I think the

---------10:43----------
mauck's is between the CPU and the GPU

---------10:45----------
well that's it for today so we managed

---------10:47----------
to fix a buffing motor today and the

---------10:49----------
2010 MacBook so as always I hope you

---------10:52----------
learned something now we're going to go

---------10:54----------
back to listening to Taylor Swift yay

---------11:03----------
you
