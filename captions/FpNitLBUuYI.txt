---------00:00----------
so what happened to the wall is that I

---------00:01----------
ripped down the nasty fake sign that was

---------00:03----------
held in by very strong and adhesive that

---------00:05----------
was near impossible to remember I

---------00:07----------
actually spent almost 25 minutes and I

---------00:10----------
didn't even have a glue gun and I put up

---------00:13----------
these acoustic panels everywhere so you

---------00:15----------
may notice that the audio quality of the

---------00:17----------
stream is higher than it used to be when

---------00:19----------
I was up in the front there are no more

---------00:21----------
early reflections or flutter echoes in

---------00:23----------
this section of the storm because I have

---------00:26----------
acoustic panels everywhere

---------00:28----------
as you can see acoustic panel their

---------00:31----------
acoustic panel there so I got about 12

---------00:33----------
acoustic panels there beautiful I have

---------00:36----------
12 of these that's seven or eight

---------00:38----------
hundred dollars after the shipping well

---------00:40----------
worth it because now the front of my

---------00:42----------
store sounds nicer so not only do you

---------00:44----------
get the benefit of superior audio

---------00:46----------
quality while listening to these streams

---------00:48----------
I hate when I hear early reflections in

---------00:49----------
a flutter echo and videos hopefully the

---------00:51----------
customers walking in will be a little

---------00:53----------
happier when there's multiple people

---------00:55----------
talking to each other here and noises of

---------00:57----------
tools that it is less annoying stressful

---------00:59----------
and just harsh sounding I'm hoping that

---------01:00----------
the superior environment makes customers

---------01:03----------
happier more likely to leave positive

---------01:05----------
reviews more likely to spend money on

---------01:08----------
things rather than leave feeling

---------01:10----------
paranoid that kilted tim is actually

---------01:13----------
correct and that we are burning their

---------01:15----------
money you got people going out of their

---------01:16----------
way to make you sound like you're a

---------01:18----------
scammer on apple.com that moderate parts

---------01:22----------
of the site well you got to pull out all

---------01:24----------
the stops and we may not look

---------01:27----------
professional but I'll be damned if we

---------01:29----------
don't sound professional no early

---------01:31----------
reflections are flutter echo in my store

---------01:34----------
someone says I bet 20 and okay that this

---------01:37----------
MacBook Air only has a bad jtag

---------01:38----------
connector that is a very very quick way

---------01:41----------
to lose 20 NOK yeah I wish this was just

---------01:44----------
gonna be jtag connector so let me know

---------01:46----------
how the sound is on this versus the last

---------01:48----------
few videos I've done up in the front I

---------01:49----------
hope it sounds better video if there's

---------01:52----------
several conversations going on at once

---------01:54----------
I'm hoping that it makes it easier for

---------01:55----------
me to understand what's going on the

---------01:57----------
more a customer feels stressed or

---------01:58----------
confused or overwhelmed in any way the

---------02:02----------
less likely they are to spend money the

---------02:04----------
fixing part of this business is actually

---------02:05----------
very easy I mean it's so easy that even

---------02:08----------
an idiot like me that as you saw in my

---------02:10----------
other live video the other day can't do

---------02:11----------
his fractions in multiplication and

---------02:13----------
properly even me who can't do is like

---------02:16----------
fraction matching and all that can

---------02:18----------
manage to fix MacBooks this part is dirt

---------02:20----------
simple all the border pair stuff is dirt

---------02:21----------
simple the hard part is dealing with

---------02:23----------
people and one of the things that makes

---------02:24----------
dealing with people a little easier is

---------02:26----------
finding these small ways to make them

---------02:28----------
feel less stressed that they don't even

---------02:30----------
notice because the less a person feels

---------02:32----------
stressed or weirded out by you the more

---------02:35----------
likely they are to spend money on having

---------02:38----------
you fix their stuff so this here is the

---------02:41----------
new MacBook Air this is the a 1932 this

---------02:46----------
is the future of the MacBook Air so the

---------02:49----------
first thing I'd like to do is see what

---------02:51----------
it is they're saying it does so they

---------02:53----------
claim liquid damage no power I am going

---------02:56----------
to plug in this MacBook Air and see if

---------03:00----------
that's the case so as I was saying if a

---------03:02----------
a 1534 MacBook is gonna want 20 volts I

---------03:05----------
have a feeling that the new MacBook Air

---------03:08----------
is going to as well and when I hit the

---------03:10----------
power button it's not doing nothing it's

---------03:11----------
still taking 200 milliamps at five volts

---------03:13----------
that's not enough to turn on and work so

---------03:15----------
let's get started by taking pieces out

---------03:18----------
of this machine so we are going to start

---------03:20----------
taking this thing apart and we're gonna

---------03:22----------
see what my board looks like and also

---------03:24----------
see if we make any progress on it

---------03:25----------
turning on after I have unplugged a lot

---------03:28----------
of the machine so let me just get myself

---------03:32----------
a t5 do you have donor boards for that

---------03:35----------
model and no I don't I have nothing for

---------03:38----------
this I have no schematic I have a no

---------03:39----------
board view I do not have donors oh

---------03:41----------
you're gonna have to wait for the little

---------03:43----------
for the drones at the factory to go over

---------03:46----------
to the garbage and start taking these

---------03:49----------
things out of the garbage and putting

---------03:52----------
them on the internet for sale they're

---------03:58----------
gonna have to get past kilted Tim though

---------04:00----------
kilted Tim kilted Tim so the first thing

---------04:06----------
I find interesting is that if we take a

---------04:08----------
look over on our audio board

---------04:10----------
the audio board is quite corroded this

---------04:12----------
is all some pretty nasty stuff over here

---------04:15----------
but I'm not as concerned with the audio

---------04:17----------
board because I don't think any of this

---------04:19----------
is going to cause it to be completely

---------04:20----------
dead and even if it was gonna cause it

---------04:22----------
to be dead I don't think at this the

---------04:24----------
audio board is going to close this would

---------04:26----------
be stuck

---------04:27----------
five volts on the charger that doesn't

---------04:30----------
seem likely to me because I don't

---------04:33----------
believe that audio is powered by PP 3v3

---------04:35----------
underscore g3 hot and even though this

---------04:37----------
is a newer model I don't have any reason

---------04:40----------
to believe that they've entirely changed

---------04:42----------
the architecture of everything now we're

---------04:43----------
going to take a look over the actual

---------04:45----------
MacBook motherboard itself now this is

---------04:47----------
one of the best microscope cameras that

---------04:48----------
you're ever gonna find and I say that

---------04:56----------
because this microscope in particular

---------04:58----------
has this specific tube I can't figure

---------05:01----------
out how to fit this setup on any other

---------05:03----------
microscope but for some reason this is

---------05:05----------
much better than those really long tubes

---------05:07----------
that kind of have a tendency to add all

---------05:10----------
this dramatic abrasions and been getting

---------05:14----------
alright so the first thing I notice here

---------05:17----------
is significant corrosion so I suppose

---------05:22----------
one of the things I should do before I

---------05:23----------
even get started on this is see if I

---------05:25----------
have the same behavior when when it's

---------05:27----------
out of the machine that I did when it

---------05:29----------
was in the machine so when I plugged

---------05:31----------
this in it's still doing 5 volts and 0

---------05:33----------
to 300 milliamps so we're getting about

---------05:36----------
the same general behavior now as you can

---------05:38----------
see the architecture here is not too

---------05:41----------
entirely changed because right next to

---------05:43----------
those two charge ports you'll see that

---------05:46----------
we have two cd32 15 ships

---------05:48----------
so the CD 32 15 s on the other Mac books

---------05:51----------
are what talk to the charger itself and

---------05:54----------
here we have those CD 32 15 s now what I

---------05:58----------
am interested in is where keep your 3 V

---------06:00----------
3 underscore g3 hot would be going to

---------06:03----------
those CD 32 15 I also want to see if PPV

---------06:06----------
4 PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot is there

---------06:08----------
remember PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot

---------06:10----------
power is the CD 32 15 s and they do need

---------06:12----------
to turn on in order to speak to the

---------06:14----------
charger and negotiate 20 volts from our

---------06:16----------
charger the problem is I don't have a

---------06:19----------
board of U for this board so I'm gonna

---------06:20----------
have to kind of guess where I would

---------06:21----------
expect people 3 B 3 underscore g3 ought

---------06:23----------
to be let's see if I can find a number

---------06:26----------
for this MacBook motherboard anywhere is

---------06:28----------
maybe if I find the number of the board

---------06:29----------
one of you lovely people watching would

---------06:31----------
be able to find me a schematic here we

---------06:33----------
go so this is an 8 - 0 - 0 1 5 - 1 - 2 0

---------06:38----------
- motherboard so one of the things I'm

---------06:40----------
going to do

---------06:41----------
is I'm going to go to my firefox window

---------06:43----------
since I have stopped using Google Chrome

---------06:45----------
I realized that it's completely and

---------06:48----------
utterly ridiculous to think at this

---------06:49----------
point that I'm gonna get Google out of

---------06:51----------
my life entirely but I'd like to take

---------06:53----------
him out of my life just a teeny tiny bit

---------06:55----------
at a time cuz the other day I found out

---------06:57----------
that without me opting in that every

---------06:59----------
time I used voice-to-text on my phone

---------07:01----------
that my phone for the last seven and a

---------07:04----------
half [ __ ] years has been saving an

---------07:06----------
audio clip of everything I've ever said

---------07:08----------
so when you use that hit that little

---------07:10----------
microphone button on an Android phone

---------07:12----------
every time I've been hitting that

---------07:14----------
microphone button from 2012 to the

---------07:16----------
present it has been saving not just the

---------07:20----------
transcript of what I said it's also been

---------07:22----------
saving the audio of what I said so now I

---------07:25----------
did happen to dig through my account and

---------07:27----------
find the settings to figure out how to

---------07:29----------
turn that [ __ ] off but what really

---------07:30----------
creeps me the [ __ ] out is that that is

---------07:33----------
something that I had to opt out of not

---------07:35----------
opt into I don't understand when in this

---------07:38----------
arrangement when did we get to the point

---------07:40----------
where we said as a society that it's

---------07:42----------
okay that you can keep an audio

---------07:44----------
recording of every single thing I've

---------07:46----------
ever [ __ ] said using a voice to text

---------07:48----------
keyboard for seven and a half years and

---------07:50----------
that this is going to be opted out

---------07:52----------
rather than opt in as soon as I saw that

---------07:55----------
I'm going through all of my Google

---------07:57----------
services and all the things that I rely

---------07:59----------
on Google for and I am slowly looking to

---------08:01----------
opt the [ __ ] out of having them in my

---------08:03----------
life I switched over to Firefox I am

---------08:05----------
deleting as much [ __ ] from all of my

---------08:08----------
Google accounts as I can I'm sure they

---------08:09----------
probably store this crap forever and

---------08:11----------
when I run for office 30 years from now

---------08:13----------
they're gonna find the one joke I said

---------08:14----------
out of context in 2007 and say that I'm

---------08:16----------
evil my next phone is I want to get one

---------08:18----------
of those Libra moans [ __ ] Android I am

---------08:20----------
focusing as much as I can on my Vimeo

---------08:22----------
account [ __ ] YouTube I'm uploading

---------08:24----------
videos to Vimeo before I upload them to

---------08:27----------
YouTube even though I get paid money if

---------08:28----------
you watch on YouTube and I pay to be

---------08:31----------
able to use Vimeo I would still prefer

---------08:32----------
that you watch my videos on Vimeo it's

---------08:35----------
always listening for the ok Google

---------08:36----------
command you can play back all the files

---------08:38----------
at cents of the cloud well that's the

---------08:39----------
other thing that thing where you say ok

---------08:42----------
Google do you know how many areas of the

---------08:44----------
phone you have to go through to turn

---------08:46----------
that [ __ ] off it's not just one area

---------08:48----------
it's not just one place that you go to

---------08:49----------
there were three different places I had

---------08:51----------
to go through to turn that [ __ ] off and

---------08:53----------
yeah the information is out there and

---------08:55----------
had to turn it off but it is so [ __ ]

---------08:59----------
buried when I realized it wasn't that I

---------09:02----------
was necessarily a that I knew exactly

---------09:05----------
what they were doing but when I realized

---------09:07----------
how hard it was to figure out how to

---------09:09----------
turn off these settings that's what set

---------09:11----------
it off in my head why are you making it

---------09:14----------
that hard why is the information that

---------09:15----------
buried on how to turn off this feature

---------09:18----------
it just it creep me the [ __ ] out I know

---------09:20----------
what you guys are doing it wasn't having

---------09:22----------
a specific piece of proof or evidence

---------09:24----------
but rather it was just a cultural aspect

---------09:26----------
of it the philosophical aspect of it

---------09:28----------
that you made it as hard as humanly

---------09:30----------
possible to turn off that feature why

---------09:33----------
did you make it as hard why did you hide

---------09:35----------
the information yeah you know you have

---------09:37----------
enough information on how people use

---------09:39----------
products you've sold enough products by

---------09:41----------
now that you know damn well how to make

---------09:44----------
that user friendly how to make it user

---------09:45----------
friendly to turn off that feature and

---------09:47----------
you didn't and that is you know there's

---------09:50----------
a good there's a good reason for that

---------09:52----------
because they are creepy Fox yeah and

---------09:57----------
people that say Amazon's likely equally

---------09:58----------
as bad as Google again I got no love for

---------10:00----------
any of these particular companies you

---------10:02----------
know when I say that there are things

---------10:04----------
that Apple does when it comes to the

---------10:06----------
their policies on repair or how they

---------10:09----------
treat independent repair shops I am NOT

---------10:11----------
saying that as someone who has Eric

---------10:14----------
Schmidt to dick in his mouth I'm not

---------10:15----------
saying that as somebody who was a fanboy

---------10:18----------
for any other platform no I'm fully

---------10:20----------
aware that the alternatives are are

---------10:24----------
created by companies that have serious

---------10:26----------
effing problems it doesn't mean that

---------10:28----------
because I dislike what one is doing that

---------10:30----------
I cosign what the other is doing that

---------10:32----------
being said it appears that I am NOT

---------10:34----------
gonna be finding any schematic on the

---------10:36----------
internet for this which means that I am

---------10:38----------
going to be guessing maybe if I were

---------10:40----------
better friends with someone at Google I

---------10:42----------
would be able to bring up a recording

---------10:45----------
from the microphone of somebody's

---------10:46----------
[ __ ] phone where they said which

---------10:48----------
capacitor on here is the one that has P

---------10:51----------
P 3 P 3 underscore G 3 hot wouldn't that

---------10:53----------
be lovely wouldn't that be beautiful

---------10:56----------
could care less about recordings praise

---------10:58----------
AI overlord you go to hell and you die

---------11:00----------
Brian Knutson the reason they do that is

---------11:03----------
to use your voice data for the machine

---------11:04----------
learning data sets the reason Google

---------11:05----------
software is better than the competition

---------11:07----------
because they know what you said in 2007

---------11:08----------
however they should make it much easier

---------11:10----------
to opt-out I agree the reason that I can

---------11:12----------
say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

---------11:13----------
and that it understands me very well is

---------11:16----------
because that data is there

---------11:18----------
however I'd say two things eh in 2010

---------11:21----------
when I got my first Android phone I got

---------11:23----------
the HTC incredible right before Samsung

---------11:25----------
stopped producing the panels for HTC

---------11:27----------
it's funny as soon as Samsung said we'd

---------11:29----------
like to start making a flagship Android

---------11:30----------
phone it's funny how they just totally

---------11:32----------
[ __ ] over HTC and the LED screens that

---------11:34----------
they were providing from them became

---------11:35----------
very rare but anyway again no fanboy if

---------11:38----------
Samsung either but what's really

---------11:39----------
interesting to me is that it understood

---------11:41----------
my voice perfectly well back then I've

---------11:43----------
never had any sort of Google device with

---------11:46----------
microphone before if you're going to say

---------11:48----------
that you're going to save every [ __ ]

---------11:50----------
recording of everything I've ever said

---------11:52----------
you're not putting that in page 70 of

---------11:54----------
some very legalese tos that's the type

---------11:56----------
of thing where I want there to be a

---------11:58----------
[ __ ] alert on my screen in size 72

---------12:00----------
font even if it's on a damn 4-inch

---------12:03----------
screen that says we are going to save

---------12:05----------
everything you have ever said ever here

---------12:09----------
it is obvious it's on the screen with

---------12:12----------
are you sure it's make me type in my

---------12:15----------
password to my damn phone make this

---------12:16----------
thing scream are you actually listening

---------12:18----------
to what we're telling you jackass

---------12:19----------
because it may be legal for you to put

---------12:21----------
that on page 60 or 70 of a tos and not

---------12:24----------
let me know that may be legal but what

---------12:26----------
that means is that once I figure out

---------12:28----------
that that is what you consider to be

---------12:29----------
okay once I figured out that that is

---------12:31----------
where your sense of morals and ethics

---------12:33----------
are that's cool it just means I ain't

---------12:36----------
using your [ __ ] anymore

---------12:37----------
and I will do everything I can to not

---------12:39----------
use your stuff anymore because if it

---------12:41----------
said in big letters hey we would like

---------12:43----------
the option do you want to opt in to

---------12:46----------
having no privacy in exchange for making

---------12:48----------
our products better fine I have no

---------12:50----------
problem with that

---------12:51----------
you put it on page 60 to 70 if some

---------12:53----------
[ __ ] TOS [ __ ] you [ __ ] you like as

---------12:57----------
soon as you do that I can't yeah [ __ ]

---------12:59----------
you as soon as you do that that's cool

---------13:01----------
but I will do my best to get people to

---------13:04----------
migrate from YouTube to Vimeo I will

---------13:06----------
stop using an Android phone I'm deleting

---------13:08----------
almost all of my Gmail accounts and all

---------13:11----------
the stuff in them and using my own ho my

---------13:13----------
own stuff I will be using DuckDuckGo my

---------13:15----------
Lex phone is gonna be the liebe Ramon I

---------13:17----------
will get Google out of my life as

---------13:20----------
as I can because again it's fair game

---------13:22----------
it's legal that you do that that's cool

---------13:25----------
just means that I ain't using your stuff

---------13:27----------
anymore said I have repeated myself 20

---------13:29----------
times let's see if we have three volts

---------13:30----------
going into this ship now usually it's

---------13:32----------
one of these four capacitors next to the

---------13:35----------
CD 32:15 that's going to have the 3.3

---------13:39----------
volts near it so let's see which one of

---------13:43----------
these any of these capacitors so we have

---------13:47----------
1.5 volts there that goes up to 3 and it

---------13:52----------
kind of loops and here we have a steady

---------13:54----------
straight up happy 3.3 this one also

---------13:57----------
loops now I'm gonna take a look at the

---------13:59----------
amount of amperage the charger is taking

---------14:01----------
and see if that looping has anything to

---------14:03----------
do with what the charger is taking now

---------14:05----------
I'm gonna guess that this is pp 3 v3

---------14:07----------
underscore g3 hot and I say guess

---------14:09----------
because I have no way of being certain

---------14:11----------
and it does seem to loop alright so what

---------14:13----------
could be causing this to loop let's take

---------14:14----------
a look over the board I think this over

---------14:16----------
here I don't think that that's corrosion

---------14:18----------
I think that that's just dust this is

---------14:21----------
also a backlight circuits I'm not really

---------14:22----------
interested in backlight circuit right

---------14:24----------
now this side of the board also seems

---------14:29----------
fairly clean to me there's nothing here

---------14:32----------
that aggravates me ok this is also yeah

---------14:37----------
you're corroded but you're by the speak

---------14:39----------
this looks like a speaker connector to

---------14:41----------
me so that's not something I would

---------14:43----------
consider a big deal here we have what

---------14:48----------
appears to be a jtag connector my you

---------14:53----------
know I'm gonna lose 20 NOK if removing

---------14:55----------
that actually fixes this I will lose

---------14:57----------
money if this fixes my board

---------14:58----------
but I'm gonna do it anyway as I

---------15:01----------
mentioned how he feels the sound

---------15:02----------
dampening is working or not

---------15:03----------
is it working I guess I'll be able to

---------15:06----------
tell when you guys tell me if it sounds

---------15:07----------
a different from all other streams

---------15:09----------
someone says you either live in fear of

---------15:10----------
being watched do you feed it garbage

---------15:12----------
data yeah that's the other thing I've

---------15:13----------
been thinking of doing is just having

---------15:14----------
the voice the text feature automatically

---------15:16----------
like switch itself on and off and have

---------15:18----------
all sorts of people use it feeding it

---------15:23----------
garbage data

---------15:28----------
because feeding it garbage data is what

---------15:31----------
is the EK if you can't delete the data

---------15:34----------
then you might as well bury what's there

---------15:35----------
I see it so as you can see that was once

---------15:39----------
a JTAG connector and that jtag connector

---------15:42----------
has been removed using the proper

---------15:45----------
protocol of burning it until it's dead

---------15:48----------
and then continuing to burn it over and

---------15:51----------
over and over and over and over and over

---------15:54----------
again that is the proper way to remove a

---------15:56----------
JTAG connector and that is the proper

---------15:58----------
procedure for troubleshooting in a

---------16:01----------
nineteen thirty two that's not turning

---------16:03----------
on okay so now I'm gonna plug it in and

---------16:08----------
see if we have any difference in our

---------16:09----------
results the data all anonymized there's

---------16:12----------
really nothing to bury feeding a garbage

---------16:14----------
data is a [ __ ] move to the developers

---------16:16----------
not the company you hurt the company by

---------16:18----------
making people aware this is a thing the

---------16:20----------
data isn't actually anonymized because

---------16:22----------
it's available when I log into my own

---------16:23----------
account so a lot of that data if I had

---------16:26----------
not known about this let's say that my

---------16:28----------
gmail account got hacked since this was

---------16:31----------
an opt-out program rather than an opt-in

---------16:33----------
program if my gmail account were

---------16:36----------
compromised I would assume that the only

---------16:38----------
thing that I had to worry about is that

---------16:39----------
my Gmail my calendar and that were

---------16:42----------
compromised however because they were

---------16:45----------
[ __ ] faces that made this as an opt-out

---------16:46----------
feature rather than an opt-in feature

---------16:48----------
that means that if you compromised my

---------16:50----------
gmail account you have not simply

---------16:51----------
compromised my email you have

---------16:53----------
compromised me to the point of allowing

---------16:55----------
somebody access to every conversation

---------16:58----------
that I've had for seven years every

---------17:00----------
private conversation every time I've

---------17:03----------
used really awful dark humor to get a

---------17:06----------
reaction out of a good friend who would

---------17:08----------
understand the context of that humour

---------17:09----------
that nobody else would you've given them

---------17:12----------
access to that every time that I have

---------17:14----------
been drunk off my ass and said something

---------17:16----------
that my friend knows the meaning of that

---------17:19----------
nobody else is gonna know the meaning of

---------17:20----------
in there in the right context you have

---------17:22----------
now given them access to that every

---------17:24----------
personal conversation I've had about

---------17:26----------
anything private that I thought was

---------17:28----------
simply just going out into the ether

---------17:30----------
once it was done has been you you've

---------17:33----------
given me access to that so no I don't

---------17:35----------
give two flying [ __ ] about the

---------17:38----------
developers my heart does not bleed for

---------17:40----------
the people that created that security

---------17:42----------
hole

---------17:42----------
and that is a security hole if you make

---------17:44----------
that an opt-out feature to the point

---------17:46----------
where I don't even know that there are

---------17:49----------
gigabytes upon gigabytes upon gigabytes

---------17:51----------
of information on every [ __ ] app I've

---------17:54----------
ever opened the time I have opened the

---------17:56----------
app what I did when I open the [ __ ]

---------17:59----------
app what I typed into the goddamn

---------18:00----------
application in that all of this

---------18:03----------
information is accessible and attached

---------18:05----------
to my name by my gmail account no [ __ ]

---------18:09----------
you and [ __ ] the people that made that

---------18:11----------
possible in the ass I don't care if I

---------18:14----------
made your life harder I don't care if

---------18:16----------
you're out of a job I don't care if you

---------18:19----------
become homeless out on the goddamn

---------18:20----------
street and starve as a result of that

---------18:22----------
because what you're doing is you are

---------18:24----------
[ __ ] with people in a very dangerous

---------18:26----------
way you are making it so that somebody

---------18:29----------
getting hacked once no longer means that

---------18:31----------
their email is getting hacked but rather

---------18:33----------
that their life's history their

---------18:35----------
conversations and all of their activity

---------18:37----------
are available to anybody who manages to

---------18:40----------
sneak into their Gmail account and if

---------18:41----------
you think that's ok [ __ ] you but thank

---------18:44----------
you for the donation

---------18:45----------
I hardly appreciate it let's continue

---------18:47----------
let's see if our JTAG removal fix the

---------18:48----------
board unfortunately it appears to still

---------18:50----------
be power cycling 5 volts 300 milliamps 5

---------18:54----------
volts 30 milliamps 5 volts 300 miles 5

---------18:57----------
volts 30 milliamps so unfortunately then

---------19:01----------
again for those who are coming in late

---------19:02----------
here I'm discussing the fact that the

---------19:05----------
that when you use Google Voice to text

---------19:08----------
on the keyboard of an Android phone

---------19:10----------
which I've been doing since 2010

---------19:12----------
somewhere around 2012 that there was an

---------19:16----------
option

---------19:16----------
where all those recordings would be

---------19:18----------
saved to your Google account to where

---------19:20----------
you could log in with your Gmail

---------19:23----------
information with your Gmail account in

---------19:25----------
your password and have access to every

---------19:28----------
single recording made over the past

---------19:30----------
seven years the time that you opened an

---------19:33----------
app what you were doing when you were

---------19:35----------
opening that the history of everything

---------19:37----------
you've ever gone to all that but also

---------19:38----------
the transcripts of what everything

---------19:42----------
you've said and the original audio

---------19:44----------
recordings of everything you said into

---------19:47----------
the phone everything that you've said

---------19:48----------
while drunk everything that you've said

---------19:51----------
while angry all the dark humor that you

---------19:53----------
may have said to a friend that was in 10

---------19:55----------
for that friend only and for nobody else

---------19:57----------
all of that [ __ ] is saved and associated

---------20:01----------
with your gmail account that is not

---------20:03----------
[ __ ] anonymized data that is not at

---------20:06----------
all if you have your gmail account

---------20:08----------
hacked if you type your password into a

---------20:11----------
phishing forum I if I did not opt into

---------20:13----------
the feature I should be safe and

---------20:16----------
assuming that the only data that you're

---------20:18----------
going to get access to is the

---------20:20----------
information that is inside of my gmail

---------20:22----------
account that the worst thing that can

---------20:23----------
happen if I type my password on a

---------20:25----------
phishing website if I pull the John

---------20:26----------
Podesta is that you're going have access

---------20:29----------
to my email not that you're gonna have

---------20:31----------
access to seven years of private and

---------20:33----------
personal conversations using my email

---------20:35----------
account that is not anonymized and [ __ ]

---------20:37----------
you if you think it is because you know

---------20:39----------
it's not now let's continue going

---------20:41----------
through this board okay so it looks like

---------20:43----------
over here we still have more corrosion

---------20:46----------
these don't look like capacitors near

---------20:48----------
data lines but rather bypass capacitors

---------20:53----------
around power MOSFETs so I think that I

---------20:56----------
should be safe if I just do a little bit

---------21:00----------
of cleaning up it is gonna refurbish

---------21:01----------
these capacitors there's a lot of flux

---------21:03----------
there so even though the solder on my

---------21:05----------
tweezers the flux there on those is

---------21:08----------
obviously expired we're just gonna have

---------21:11----------
new flux over there and it's going to

---------21:14----------
allow me to redo my tweezers not redo my

---------21:19----------
tweezers just going to allow me to redo

---------21:20----------
these connections in peace

---------21:26----------
how's it going Daniel Daniel we redid

---------21:29----------
the front of the store a little bit

---------21:31----------
think you'd enjoy think you'd like it

---------21:33----------
how's school going

---------21:42----------
and we gotta be get putting speakers up

---------21:43----------
here soon as well I think I got some

---------21:47----------
axiom and sixties in storage that I'm

---------21:50----------
gonna have enough run I hate to say this

---------21:53----------
but as a computer tech you should have

---------21:54----------
known this I have known about it for

---------21:55----------
very long time and told all my customers

---------21:57----------
they're like again I've always been

---------22:01----------
aware of the fact that the way Google

---------22:02----------
makes their money is by tracking the

---------22:04----------
websites you go to and making profiles

---------22:07----------
of people I get that it's just at the

---------22:09----------
same time when you sit down and you see

---------22:12----------
seven years of your conversations

---------22:14----------
available and you know damn well that

---------22:16----------
you never clicked on a checkbox for it

---------22:18----------
it's this feeling of being violated that

---------22:20----------
is really really hard to undo yeah maybe

---------22:24----------
I should have known better but is that

---------22:27----------
again there was a question that I have

---------22:28----------
is that what any of us really signed up

---------22:29----------
for because I think at the end of the

---------22:31----------
day we just thought wow you're giving us

---------22:35----------
a gigabyte of email storage and the

---------22:37----------
ability to send really large files in a

---------22:39----------
really nice interface okay I'll deal

---------22:42----------
with a robot that advertises based on

---------22:44----------
the content in my personal emails I

---------22:45----------
think that's what we agreed to I think

---------22:48----------
that is the that the general societal

---------22:51----------
agreement that we came to I don't think

---------22:53----------
any of us came to the agreement that

---------22:54----------
yeah I'll just totally let you save

---------22:57----------
seven years worth of conversations that

---------22:59----------
I've had to my email account where if

---------23:02----------
that's ever hacked that somebody can

---------23:04----------
then go ahead and listen to everything

---------23:08----------
I've ever said that I didn't even know

---------23:10----------
was being saved that's I don't think

---------23:12----------
that that was ever part of the deal and

---------23:14----------
that's that's going a little far with it

---------23:17----------
Congrats it ain't no I'll say obviously

---------23:19----------
I don't know everything there's a ton of

---------23:21----------
stuff that I don't know and I'm sure

---------23:23----------
that the things that I don't know that

---------23:26----------
people think I should know are much more

---------23:30----------
than you would then you would imagine

---------23:32----------
firsthand

---------23:35----------
but

---------23:39----------
I don't think that this is what any of

---------23:40----------
us agreed to let's see

---------23:47----------
SanDisk an and he was solder ball and I

---------23:50----------
think if people knew that stuff upfront

---------23:52----------
and that that was their intention to do

---------23:53----------
that upfront they wouldn't be dealing

---------23:55----------
with this they would not be using their

---------23:56----------
that company stuff they wouldn't have

---------23:58----------
let them crawl that deep in but it maybe

---------24:00----------
I'm just overreacting but again when you

---------24:02----------
sit there when you sit there and you're

---------24:04----------
just looking through at 3:53 a.m. on

---------24:08----------
January 20th 2014

---------24:11----------
Louis opens this application at January

---------24:14----------
20th 2014 5 a.m. here is a copy of a

---------24:19----------
voice recording of what Louis said while

---------24:21----------
shitposting in his IRC channel or

---------24:23----------
something like god damn that is creepy

---------24:27----------
that is just creepy too creepy too

---------24:30----------
creepy oh it's too - no no it makes my

---------24:35----------
skin crawl just [ __ ] thinking about

---------24:37----------
it alright let's see if we got any

---------24:40----------
changed now this is one of the reasons

---------24:42----------
that I try to avoid insulting Apple

---------24:44----------
customers or users directly if you see

---------24:46----------
with the things that other companies are

---------24:48----------
doing I completely understand why

---------24:49----------
somebody would say yeah I'll deal with

---------24:51----------
an iPhone I really don't like Google

---------24:53----------
very much don't get it twisted I'm not

---------24:56----------
saying that Apple probably wouldn't spy

---------24:58----------
and sell you out either but at the very

---------25:00----------
least at least they pretend to care

---------25:02----------
about privacy all right is my first

---------25:08----------
charge port working

---------25:27----------
let's see when I get the 300 ml M spike

---------25:30----------
I get an Apple logo okay what happens

---------25:37----------
after the Apple logo though

---------25:49----------
go go go go go go go go go go mofo boot

---------25:55----------
boot this is pretty impressive it's

---------25:59----------
booting at 300 milliamps either it's

---------26:01----------
impressive that it's able to boot and

---------26:03----------
power up it's such a low amperage or the

---------26:06----------
machine is entirely screwed and that's

---------26:08----------
why it's not okay

---------26:09----------
this is booting Wow pretty good good

---------26:12----------
stuff so this is the MacBook Air that

---------26:14----------
Paul refused to work on for about the

---------26:16----------
past week and so I decided to take it

---------26:19----------
out of the queue because I am unlike

---------26:23----------
Paul I'm a very considerate person I

---------26:25----------
care about people having difficult items

---------26:28----------
in their queue I know that Paul did not

---------26:31----------
want this machine in his queue because

---------26:33----------
he thought that the a 1932 is going to

---------26:36----------
be impossible to fix due to the lack of

---------26:38----------
schematics board views and donor boards

---------26:40----------
I understand that Paul did not want to

---------26:43----------
work on this because he believed that it

---------26:45----------
was going to be above his skill level

---------26:47----------
and too hard and because I am such a

---------26:49----------
kind employer because I am so benevolent

---------26:52----------
towards my staff I decided to take this

---------26:56----------
difficult item out of his queue and work

---------26:59----------
on it in my queue ran through the hell

---------27:04----------
of having to remove a jtag connector and

---------27:06----------
then tidy up a little bit of corrosion

---------27:09----------
on the three capacitors next to that

---------27:11----------
jtag connector I do not want to put you

---------27:13----------
through the hell of opening a device

---------27:15----------
that you haven't opened before before

---------27:17----------
the schematics and the board views

---------27:18----------
around I would never want to do that to

---------27:21----------
you

---------27:21----------
so I took on this burden I carried this

---------27:24----------
cross because I care about you I hope

---------27:27----------
you appreciate it Paul and that's it for

---------27:29----------
today and as always I hope you learned

---------27:31----------
something are there any other a 1932 s I

---------27:35----------
can take out of your queue he's gonna

---------27:37----------
see you in the next one

---------27:47----------
do you have a Macbook that need to be

---------27:49----------
fixed come by our store which is open to

---------27:52----------

---------27:54----------

---------28:04----------
our open hours where you can contact us

---------28:06----------

and the directions on how to send us a

---------28:23----------
Macbook for repair don't like liquid

---------28:27----------
affiliate link down below when i go over

---------28:30----------
here to voice an audio play i dated a

---------28:33----------
woman seven years ago who said comma

---------28:36----------
it's not your money comma but the person

---------28:41----------
you had to be and in order for it to

---------28:43----------
recognize my voice easier I've noticed

---------28:45----------
that recognizes my voice easier if I

---------28:47----------
talk more like a robot but the point is

---------28:48----------
every conversation I've had even if I

---------28:51----------
was not having that conversation on

---------28:53----------
Gmail it is here because we've all kind

---------28:57----------
of gotten to that point of saying okay

---------28:59----------
fine if the bot wants to read through my

---------29:01----------
email or have access to my browser

---------29:02----------
cookies so I get free stuff yeah fine

---------29:05----------
but if I am using signal or I am using

---------29:09----------
any sort of other application or I'm in

---------29:12----------
an IRC app that is not run or owned by

---------29:15----------
Google and anywhere associated with

---------29:17----------
Google just if I use that voice to text

---------29:19----------
keyboard without me opting in

---------29:23----------
you are saving everything I have ever

---------29:25----------
said and again I believe I brought this

---------29:28----------
up once but one individual had said that

---------29:31----------
listen it's not it's not this state is

---------29:34----------
anonymized you're just hurting the

---------29:36----------
developers if you turn this feature off

---------29:37----------
you stop using this stuff or you

---------29:39----------
purposely feed disinformation into the

---------29:41----------
or into the product because that's only

---------29:44----------
going to hurt to developers those poor

---------29:46----------
developers this is all anonymized and I

---------29:48----------
it's really important that I bring up

---------29:50----------
that that is complete [ __ ] that is

---------29:53----------
that is a kill to Tim

---------29:55----------
community support forums level of

---------29:57----------
[ __ ] because let's say your name is

---------29:59----------
James Smith 88 because you were born in

---------30:02----------
1988 so James Smith 88 at gmail.com and

---------30:05----------
your email account gets hacked you enter

---------30:08----------
you know you pull a Podesta and you

---------30:09----------
enter your password into some phishing

---------30:11----------
site or something you may think that the

---------30:13----------
only risk there if you hadn't opted into

---------30:15----------
something like this was your email

---------30:17----------
getting hacked but in reality it's not

---------30:19----------
that it's everything you have ever said

---------30:22----------
using that keyboard has been saved and

---------30:25----------
this is not anonymize so if I have let's

---------30:28----------
say Lewis dot Rossman at gmail.com and

---------30:31----------
that email account is then hacked or if

---------30:34----------
you if on Google's back-end they are

---------30:37----------
associating Lewis dot Rossmann at

---------30:39----------
gmail.com with this my activity none of

---------30:42----------
this is anonymized data all of this is

---------30:44----------
not just not anonymized but it is

---------30:47----------
clearly classified - with my account in

---------30:50----------
a nice little ordered list so when I am

---------30:55----------
making some decisions about security or

---------30:58----------
what I'm doing or length of password or

---------30:59----------
where I'm logging in I'm making those

---------31:01----------
decisions assuming that you know if my

---------31:03----------
YouTube account or it gets hacked my

---------31:05----------
gmail my YouTube my videos I'm risking

---------31:08----------
that I'm not thinking that I'm making

---------31:11----------
that the risk is there that everything I

---------31:13----------
have said over the past seven years will

---------31:16----------
be there and I have no idea what it is

---------31:17----------
that occurred between 2010 and around

---------31:20----------
2012 from when I started using the voice

---------31:23----------
to text feature to the point that it

---------31:25----------
decided to start uploading every single

---------31:28----------
[ __ ] clip and transcripting it in

---------31:30----------
storing it in a place where if anybody

---------31:32----------
ever hacks my password they can hear and

---------31:35----------
see every conversation I've had for

---------31:36----------
seven years this was not me having a

---------31:38----------
nice little alert in my screen where

---------31:40----------
they said would you like to opt in to

---------31:41----------
all of your conversations being on our

---------31:43----------
server forever

---------31:44----------
no that was this was prop most likely

---------31:47----------
some this is on page 80 of a Terms of

---------31:49----------
Service and legal ease that you're

---------31:50----------
probably not gonna read or ever

---------31:52----------
understand this is just it's freaky all

---------31:54----------
sorts of searches up here when I first

---------31:56----------
saw this Steve was sitting next to me so

---------31:58----------
I thought oh just for the hell of it

---------32:00----------
let's see if I've said anything bad

---------32:01----------
about you here I typed in Steve sucks I

---------32:03----------
typed in Steve [ __ ] I typed in all

---------32:06----------
sorts of

---------32:08----------
nasty words up just to figure out what's

---------32:10----------
the worst dark humor that I have ever

---------32:13----------
decided to say what's the meanest thing

---------32:15----------
that I've ever said to a somebody that I

---------32:17----------
know with a wallet when I was angry and

---------32:20----------
private what's the worst joke I've ever

---------32:22----------
told while drunk and it's all here

---------32:25----------
I wanted to scrub myself off with one of

---------32:27----------
the with it with a damn brillo pad I

---------32:29----------
felt so dirty after this happened so I

---------32:31----------
would suggest that you check this out my

---------32:33----------
activity google comm use the main

---------32:35----------
account with your phone and go through

---------32:37----------
it hardest through all of it and also

---------32:39----------
ask yourself what data did you opt in to

---------32:42----------
Google just collecting and what data do

---------32:45----------
you know damn well in that list that you

---------32:47----------
would never in a million years have

---------32:49----------
opted into somebody collecting that you

---------32:51----------
know is only being collected because of

---------32:52----------
some [ __ ] on page 60 of some Terms

---------32:55----------
of Service I mean just imagine the

---------32:57----------
levels of the types of blackmail that

---------32:59----------
could be done with people who have

---------33:02----------
probably said way worse stuff than me

---------33:03----------
just imagine all the different ways that

---------33:05----------
this can be hacked let's say that there

---------33:07----------
are people at Google that are able to

---------33:08----------
get access to this I mean you see the

---------33:10----------
internal arguments that are being at had

---------33:12----------
at Google when it comes to AI when it

---------33:14----------
comes to dealing directly with the

---------33:17----------
government or helping the government or

---------33:18----------
helping the military when you see what

---------33:20----------
happened with let's say things like the

---------33:21----------
James d'amore memo two years ago there

---------33:23----------
are people within Google that are having

---------33:26----------
ideological wars with each other and

---------33:29----------
these individuals who are very very

---------33:33----------
happy to just say like just shadow band

---------33:36----------
destroy cut you out of a conversation

---------33:39----------
cut you out of a job these are the

---------33:42----------
individuals that have access to every

---------33:44----------
single thing you've ever said and it

---------33:46----------
just kind of makes me wonder like how

---------33:49----------
long is it going to be until we start

---------33:52----------
seeing rogue elements within within

---------33:54----------
these companies that have these types of

---------33:56----------
ideological bends decide to just start

---------33:58----------
going through people's accounts that are

---------34:01----------
high profile individuals finding all

---------34:03----------
these types of things and just start

---------34:06----------
leaking them is when that happens that's

---------34:09----------
when you're gonna see the the real

---------34:10----------
serious [ __ ] start to hit the fan and

---------34:14----------
it's not even going to be with Google I

---------34:16----------
think it's going to be with individuals

---------34:18----------
and the way you start to realize the

---------34:20----------
fragility of

---------34:22----------
relationships if you have some let's say

---------34:25----------
if you've ever said something about

---------34:27----------
somebody that you think was probably not

---------34:31----------
something you should have said it was

---------34:33----------
probably or probably something that's

---------34:34----------
best they didn't hear because it was 3

---------34:36----------
a.m. and you were in a bar and you were

---------34:37----------
angry or agitated or something imagine

---------34:40----------
what it's like if not only that

---------34:41----------
information is being recorded and stored

---------34:43----------
in a central location but also if

---------34:46----------
anybody that works at that company at a

---------34:49----------
really high level has the ability to get

---------34:52----------
to that information or hack into that

---------34:54----------
information

---------34:55----------
oh it's Frankie I'm trying to think of

---------34:58----------
this one case because this has happened

---------34:59----------
before and I hope that some of you can

---------35:02----------
remind me of the name there was this one

---------35:04----------
individual at KU that worked at Google

---------35:06----------
he was really skinny he had long hair

---------35:09----------
really creepy so this would not be

---------35:11----------
something new I wish I remember the name

---------35:12----------
I just remember was a really skinny

---------35:14----------
lanky tall fellow with really long hair

---------35:17----------
kind of creepy looking I want you to

---------35:19----------
imagine your worst enemy having access

---------35:21----------
to this type of stuff without you ever

---------35:23----------
having consented to enter the system and

---------35:26----------
and I know I'm kind of rambling it's 12

---------35:30----------
44 in the morning I think that if some

---------35:32----------
of you check this and see what's in your

---------35:34----------
my activity Google comm that you may

---------35:37----------
find that you feel violated as well
