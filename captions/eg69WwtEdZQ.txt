---------00:00----------
all right so today we're going to be

---------00:01----------
going over a machine that is not turning

---------00:03----------
on now the interesting thing with this

---------00:04----------
machine is it actually does turn on if

---------00:05----------
you just plug in the charger one thing

---------00:07----------
to realize with this machine's is that

---------00:08----------
if you plug in the charger on any of the

---------00:10----------
core i5 core i7 models from 2010 and up

---------00:13----------
they automatically turn themselves on if

---------00:15----------
you just plug in the charge now it's not

---------00:17----------
turning on when you just hit the power

---------00:19----------
button so let's try to think about why

---------00:22----------
that is let's try to think about how it

---------00:23----------
is the computer knows that you hit the

---------00:25----------
power button on these models so if you

---------00:26----------
were to go over to the keyboard

---------00:28----------
connector what you will see is a bunch

---------00:31----------
of different signals and I want you to

---------00:33----------
think again as we do in all these videos

---------00:35----------
all these episodes I want you to think

---------00:37----------
tell me which one of these do you think

---------00:38----------
is going to be responsible for turning

---------00:39----------
the computer on you get 20 seconds this

---------00:46----------
this this this this is this this which

---------00:49----------
one isn't if you guessed it was WS

---------00:52----------
keyboard on/off l than yes you are

---------00:54----------
correct this is the power button when

---------00:56----------
you press this it is going to short this

---------00:57----------
to ground this goes through our 48 10

---------01:00----------
which goes to s MC on off L SMC on off L

---------01:03----------
is a signal that goes to the SMC which

---------01:05----------
is the system management controller as

---------01:08----------
you can see if you simply scroll down

---------01:09----------
over here it'll say SMC at some point

---------01:13----------
and when you short SMC on off L to

---------01:16----------
ground s the computer knows that you

---------01:19----------
with the power button so SMC on off L is

---------01:21----------
pulled up by a pull-up resistor to 3.3

---------01:24----------
volts as you can see over here this is

---------01:25----------
3.3 volts and you can see that you have

---------01:29----------
our 50 170 pulling that signal up to 3.3

---------01:35----------
volts hmm yon now when you put the power

---------01:41----------
button on the keyboard when your the

---------01:42----------
power button the keyboard that signal

---------01:43----------
will be short to ground well that you

---------01:44----------
turned it on and that's going to be on

---------01:46----------
pin 5 with a keyboard connector now if

---------01:48----------
we look in the microscope if we were to

---------01:49----------
look in the microscope you would see

---------01:51----------
that you would look in the microscope

---------01:53----------
you would if you were to piece of

---------01:59----------
if you were to look in the microscope

---------02:06----------
hello

---------02:09----------
anybody home you piece of

---------02:14----------
capture car all right are we good are we

---------02:16----------
rolling are we rolling yeah okay now you

---------02:19----------
bow of course you're bending see when I

---------02:21----------
move it really fast to get lines but

---------02:23----------
what are you gonna do I'm the PI new

---------02:26----------
capture hardware for anytime soon I know

---------02:28----------
so this is the keyboard connector it's

---------02:32----------
fine like I finally got lighting for the

---------02:34----------
apartment I because I found these light

---------02:36----------
fixtures in the basement found these

---------02:38----------
light fixtures in the basement so I

---------02:40----------
figured I might as well use what I

---------02:41----------
already have about some bulbs it's like

---------02:42----------
right as I do that something else breaks

---------02:44----------
it's like no no I'm not spending money

---------02:47----------
again nice try

---------02:48----------
so this pin five the keyboard connector

---------02:50----------
as you can see it doesn't look very nice

---------02:52----------
you have pin five the keyboard connector

---------02:53----------
right over here and you have a line

---------02:55----------
going to here now here you have a look a

---------02:56----------
nice healthy little gold thingy going to

---------02:59----------
the other side of the board healthy gold

---------03:01----------
or copper thingy healthy gold or copper

---------03:03----------
thingy healthy gold or copper thingy

---------03:05----------
 the gold or copper thing so we're

---------03:07----------
going to do is we're just going to try

---------03:08----------
to work our way in there and just try to

---------03:10----------
make a nice connection to the other side

---------03:11----------
of the board we can try to revive that

---------03:13----------
connection I'll show you how we're gonna

---------03:18----------
do over here is we're going to do a

---------03:19----------
little bit of scraping you need some

---------03:22----------
scraping with some flux so we're gonna

---------03:24----------
some fluxing and some scraping than some

---------03:26----------
fluxing and some scraping we're gonna

---------03:29----------
get our way into the other side of the

---------03:31----------
board and then we'll see if we have a

---------03:32----------
working keyboard or you can keyboard

---------03:37----------
connector all right so

---------03:40----------
we'll wait for this iron to heat up it's

---------03:42----------
all nice and heated up

---------03:45----------
go

---------03:54----------
can we get through to the other side of

---------03:56----------
the board

---------04:09----------
look at the other side of the board

---------04:23----------
and let's just fill that hole right up

---------04:27----------
let's fill that hole right up so do this

---------04:43----------
nice fresh sauna with some nice fresh

---------04:45----------
flux is there anything more beautiful

---------04:49----------
than a hole with fresh solder and fresh

---------04:51----------
flux I can't imagine okay so go around

---------04:58----------
the side and do the exact same thing

---------05:00----------
it's gonna dig and dig and dig until you

---------05:02----------
can get to the bottom now if you're

---------05:06----------
talented you'll be able to get a wire in

---------05:08----------
there if you are talented it will be

---------05:10----------
very very easy for you to just put some

---------05:13----------
battery wire in there and get from one

---------05:14----------
side of the board to the other that's if

---------05:16----------
you're talented I am not so I'm gonna

---------05:20----------
run a nice ugly wire because I'm I suck

---------05:23----------
so just in case that didn't work which

---------05:27----------
it probably didn't it may work it may

---------05:30----------
not yeah I don't really feel like

---------05:31----------
trusting it what I'm gonna do is I'm

---------05:33----------
going to take an old set of

---------05:34----------
nasty-looking tweezers and I'm just

---------05:36----------
gonna scrape way a little bit over here

---------05:41----------
I was gonna put a wire from one side to

---------05:44----------
the other what do you want from me I'm

---------05:47----------
not talented I'm not the great jessa

---------05:50----------
fish only Jessa is the great Jessa fish

---------05:56----------
so the pyramid reball and Shh yeah yeah

---------06:08----------
suck oh well but

---------06:20----------
this could have been done so much neater

---------06:23----------
could have been so pretty

---------07:08----------
all right let's get right into this see

---------07:14----------
if we can make this neat I would use the

---------07:17----------
micro pencil but I think Jason Jason

---------07:19----------
always has two of them on his table and

---------07:20----------
I always have zero on mine I don't think

---------07:22----------
that's fair but life is not always fair

---------07:24----------
and you're just gonna have to deal with

---------07:25----------
it so we do this this would be much

---------07:32----------
easier with a micro pencil why does

---------07:35----------
Jason need two micro pencils somebody

---------07:38----------
tell me why Jason needs two of these

---------07:39----------
things I think one is just fine we're

---------07:44----------
going to do this and I'm going to secure

---------07:46----------
it down over here as well might as well

---------07:54----------
and I make a grand old ship to the other

---------07:55----------
side of the board

---------08:06----------
she changed

---------08:25----------
oh which one is it

---------08:32----------
hmm on the top it's the top one and the

---------08:37----------
third which means in here it's going to

---------08:39----------
be when I flip it it's going to be the

---------08:40----------
bottom one right the third one way to

---------08:50----------
find out I'm not good with this short

---------08:53----------
term memory stuff yeah it's good it's

---------08:55----------
going to the resistor see it's got to be

---------08:57----------
this one see this is the 1 kilo ohm

---------08:59----------
resistor that was in the schematic in

---------09:01----------
between keyboard and SMC Oh Noel alright

---------09:03----------
so there we go

---------09:04----------
and just for it and again just just for

---------09:07----------
the hell of it we can also terminate it

---------09:08----------
at the at the resistor jazz for the

---------09:14----------
hello we can terminate it at the

---------09:15----------
resistor as well just for that extra

---------09:19----------
extra bit of OCD this

---------09:31----------
now we can lower the wire for even more

---------09:33----------
ocz make it pretty OCD make it perfectly

---------09:37----------
flat on the board did I just say ocz

---------09:38----------
instead of OCD do you believe I nail why

---------09:43----------
did I name ask a company that sells

---------09:45----------
scammy pora shitty SSDs instead of OCD

---------09:49----------
all right got that and there's um pin

---------09:54----------
fours it works it did beep it does

---------09:58----------
actually work but man I don't like it

---------10:02----------
that much

---------10:11----------
all right it I'll run that wire as

---------10:13----------
well it works but it just it looks nasty

---------10:16----------
every key on the keyboard does work that

---------10:18----------
does work but man I don't want to leave

---------10:19----------
that looking like it does it's gross

---------10:29----------
depend for next

---------10:36----------
all righty let's get a wife pin for

---------10:39----------
shall we do a little bit of scraping and

---------10:44----------
we'll be good

---------10:51----------
oh that's too much exposed wire

---------10:56----------
let's cut that a little shorter shall we

---------10:58----------
that's what it's going to take this and

---------11:00----------
cut it a little shorter there we go

---------11:09----------
Mannis up is ten times easier with the

---------11:11----------
micro pencil why am i tortured mess why

---------11:13----------
don't you just get up you lazy bum like

---------11:16----------
the amount of that I will do to get

---------11:18----------
this to work with the wrong iron

---------11:20----------
rather than simply get up and just get

---------11:24----------
the other one like I talk about this

---------11:27----------
 being in shape and being in shape

---------11:29----------
so that when you decide you know I have

---------11:31----------
to walk across a room to do something

---------11:33----------
it's easy and it's like you do all this

---------11:34----------
effort you do all this work to get in

---------11:36----------
shape to wear running for six miles

---------11:38----------
doesn't make you exhausted you can lift

---------11:41----------
weights for an hour to everyday in a

---------11:42----------
sacred book what the book what's the

---------11:44----------
point of all that if you're still

---------11:46----------
hazy buff

---------12:03----------
is so not the iron for this

---------12:10----------
alright that is soldered on though we do

---------12:13----------
got a connection and now we go to the

---------12:15----------
other side this is the bottom second one

---------12:17----------
which means when I turn it upside down

---------12:18----------
be the top second one just run it along

---------12:24----------
the same way around the other connection

---------12:25----------
make sure it's a nice taut wire oh great

---------12:34----------
oh great that's nice and close

---------12:42----------
oh well we'll make it work we'll make it

---------12:44----------
work watch and just watch and learn

---------12:46----------
watch and learn watch the master idiot

---------12:52----------
watch the master idiot there we go and

---------12:56----------
that's looking a little bit too

---------12:57----------
Hershey's kiss for me I'm going to do

---------13:02----------
this

---------13:12----------
you can move that back in a place to

---------13:14----------
where I want it to be

---------13:41----------
is obviously as they get called osanic

---------13:43----------
and all that because this is that's just

---------13:48----------
too much flux even by my standards that

---------13:51----------
is too much flux we got our two wires in

---------13:53----------
place

---------13:57----------
and if you're smart what you'll do is

---------13:59----------
you'll figure out a way to fill a wire

---------14:01----------
or even smaller than this through the

---------14:02----------
board and just sort of like that I'm

---------14:04----------
just missing a wire that's that short so

---------14:06----------
I'm working with the magnet wire I have

---------14:07----------
this is 40 AWG and this is pretty much

---------14:10----------
as small as my wire gets I don't have

---------14:13----------
anything smaller than this but if you

---------14:16----------
did you could just poke a hole right

---------14:17----------
through the board so let's see if this

---------14:20----------
actually works all right so I cleaned

---------14:22----------
off the board a little bit I am going to

---------14:23----------
got myself a keyboard just so that I can

---------14:25----------
test and see what's going on I just

---------14:27----------
plugged it in it's off I'm going hit the

---------14:30----------
power button and with any luck it turns

---------14:32----------
on I said I hit the power button and

---------14:37----------
with any luck it turns on you piece up

---------14:40----------
oh well you can see the light you heard

---------14:44----------
the chime and yeah I'm not going to keep

---------14:51----------
it on without a heatsink long enough to

---------14:52----------
get to a question mark but that is it

---------14:55----------
and you can see a little bit of what it

---------14:56----------
looked like afterwards and in here it's

---------14:58----------
not exactly the what I would say the

---------15:00----------
prettiest thing in the world but we're

---------15:02----------
going to cover it up in green stuffs he

---------15:04----------
won't be able to see it anyway let's see

---------15:07----------
can you see that do you see anything I

---------15:10----------
don't think you see anything I think

---------15:12----------
that my microscope camera froze again is

---------15:14----------
that what happened is that what happened

---------15:17----------
did you freeze again did you up

---------15:20----------
again you piece a crap capture card and

---------15:22----------
we're back let's check out what those

---------15:25----------
beautiful wires look like and they're

---------15:29----------
soldered by an idiot's glory okay look

---------15:34----------
at this just lift this up a little bit

---------15:37----------
and we're just gonna make that look a

---------15:39----------
little bit less like I I did it so we're

---------15:43----------
going to just do a little bit of this

---------15:46----------
greens

---------15:50----------
green stuff green stuff green stuff hey

---------16:01----------
and I'll take the board out and give it

---------16:02----------
a little bit something a little bit more

---------16:04----------
you want some more I'll give you some

---------16:07----------
more well it sounded a lot like this

---------16:11----------
frame trying to think what Frank Zappa

---------16:12----------
song does he say something that sounds

---------16:13----------
just like that you want some more I'll

---------16:16----------
give you some more is it Montana is it

---------16:19----------
Dynamo hum with something on that album

---------16:23----------
I forget the name of the album now crap

---------16:24----------
what Frank Zappa album had the song

---------16:27----------
Montana and dynamo hum on there Montana

---------16:30----------
was such an amazing song you have that

---------16:32----------
part where they're singing about the

---------16:34----------
dental floss now this it was just mean

---------16:38----------
the I know it sounds silly that they're

---------16:39----------
singing about dental floss but the

---------16:40----------
actual just the construction of the song

---------16:43----------
is added a song structure everything is

---------16:44----------
just amazing but also what I really

---------16:47----------
liked about that song was the which is

---------16:50----------
this thing ah that neo down the Falls

---------16:52----------
they did it huh dad I mean I'm I'm

---------16:56----------
ruining it please but you you have to go

---------16:58----------
listen to it on its own it's

---------17:00----------
amazing

---------17:01----------
Frank Zappa died too young he made

---------17:03----------
amazing music I didn't like all of it I

---------17:07----------
mean there was some of it righteous

---------17:08----------
listener when I go what the hell is this

---------17:09----------
but man he was good at what he did but

---------17:14----------
yeah Montana was such a good song in the

---------17:17----------
middle of Montana

---------17:25----------
good song alright so we have our wire

---------17:32----------
here and yeah we just covered in some

---------17:35----------
green stuff so I can't really yeah yeah

---------17:38----------
I could have just drilled a hole through

---------17:40----------
the board but this works what do you

---------17:43----------
want from me it's nice and flat with the

---------17:45----------
board it's going to where it's going

---------17:48----------
green the reason I like green is people

---------17:50----------
say oh you can see the green pen the

---------17:52----------
first reason I like the green pen over

---------17:54----------
the black one this is a circuit work CW

---------17:57----------
3300 G and it's set on face focus what

---------18:03----------
if I make this my mustache yeah we be

---------18:05----------
able to see it yeah focus on my face

---------18:08----------
there we go now focus on the circuit

---------18:11----------
works Ben it's too close to my mouth for

---------18:15----------
comfort anyway I really should just

---------18:18----------
turned off the autofocus but I

---------18:20----------
like about this the black pen firstly it

---------18:23----------
doesn't flow for some reason I bought it

---------18:25----------
and I was like just trying to jam the

---------18:26----------
stuff out of the pen it wouldn't come

---------18:28----------
out the second thing I like while black

---------18:30----------
would blend in with the board and give

---------18:31----------
it a more professional look

---------18:33----------
Green is scary this tells people stay

---------18:37----------
away be careful around this don't touch

---------18:39----------
this and that's the exact effect that I

---------18:41----------
want this to have I don't want somebody

---------18:42----------
looking at this going oh is that really

---------18:44----------
there is that a part of the border is

---------18:46----------
that some lik oh I broke the wire off I

---------18:49----------
want them looking at that and going damn

---------18:51----------
that is not supposed to be there I'm not

---------18:53----------
 with it that's what the green

---------18:55----------
stuff is supposed to be for and it does

---------18:56----------
a great job of it so that's how we fixed

---------18:59----------
this board and as always I hope you

---------19:01----------
learned something
