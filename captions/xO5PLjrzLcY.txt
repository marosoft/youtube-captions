---------00:04----------
don't delay by today so this MacBook

---------00:08----------
claims to have no image on the screen

---------00:10----------
just try and figure out why there's no

---------00:12----------
image on this ancient a 1278 old pile of

---------00:15----------
junk plug in this dirty MacBook and we

---------00:21----------
have a gray screen however the gray

---------00:26----------
screen does not produce an Apple logo or

---------00:29----------
a picket R so I'm gonna wait for it to

---------00:32----------
boot a little bit see if we get any

---------00:34----------
question mark fold or anything like that

---------00:35----------
the first thing we got to do since we're

---------00:37----------
not getting anything on the screen is

---------00:39----------
check pin three on the LCD connector

---------00:41----------
that's where the LCD VDD is so VDD is

---------00:46----------
gonna give you the power going in for

---------00:48----------
something and LCD is the LCD in 3.3

---------00:50----------
volts as power going into the LCD and

---------00:52----------
that's supposed to be on pins two and

---------00:53----------
three so the first thing to measure here

---------00:54----------
is pin three on the LCD connector

---------00:58----------
actually and I was just about to unplug

---------01:01----------
the sleep sensor but as you may be able

---------01:03----------
to see or not the sleep sensor has

---------01:05----------
actually not plugged in so great

---------01:07----------
somebody already [ __ ] that up that's

---------01:08----------
great right so let's measure pin three

---------01:11----------
on the LCD connector and see what it is

---------01:14----------
we find hey look a tear on a solder

---------01:18----------
trace do we even really need to measure

---------01:23----------
this with a microscope is they're

---------01:29----------
measuring required here I don't think we

---------01:32----------
need to measure that I think we know

---------01:34----------
exactly why this has no picture but I'm

---------01:37----------
gonna measure it anyway so let's see how

---------01:39----------
many volts the screen is actually

---------01:40----------
getting so the screen is supposed to be

---------01:43----------
getting 3.3 volts and according to this

---------01:47----------
on pins 2 & 3 we get 0.8 volts now

---------01:50----------
here's the interesting part and here's

---------01:52----------
the thing that a lot of people miss and

---------01:53----------
I used to miss in the beginning as well

---------01:55----------
you see that the screen is gray right

---------01:59----------
hey you're back

---------02:04----------
don't leave us ever again oh come back

---------02:11----------
to work please

---------02:12----------
everybody we've hired has been a total

---------02:15----------
idiot we need you back we miss you so

---------02:17----------
much I'll double your pay you'll get the

---------02:20----------
best health care you'll get flowers and

---------02:22----------
a cake every and tea and chocolate three

---------02:25----------
times a day

---------02:25----------
and we'll get you another cute kitty cat

---------02:27----------
and I'll get you a Mercedes come back

---------02:31----------
I'll get you a better Mercedes how about

---------02:35----------
a Bentley I miss old employee I'm sorry

---------02:37----------
for that interruption we had an

---------02:39----------
ex-employee come back that we missed

---------02:41----------
terribly we're trying to convert from ex

---------02:43----------
employees and employee we miss Venera so

---------02:51----------
this here this screen it looks like it's

---------02:54----------
turning on right you see how it's gray

---------02:55----------
the REIT well it's gray so people will

---------02:58----------
think the screen is turning on but it's

---------03:00----------
not this screen will actually turn on

---------03:02----------
even if it has point 5 volts and even

---------03:04----------
though the screen needs 3.3 volts to

---------03:06----------
function you will get this general

---------03:08----------
grayness of it just starting up with

---------03:11----------
point 5 volts so the screen looks like

---------03:15----------
it's turning on but it's not and this

---------03:18----------
will especially confuse you if you have

---------03:21----------
a case where the inductor looks good

---------03:22----------
now here the inductor looks like trash

---------03:24----------
so it's it's obvious that what's going

---------03:27----------
on here you mean you don't need to be a

---------03:29----------
genius to check this out but if this

---------03:32----------
inductor is not blown up and the screen

---------03:35----------
looks like that very few people are

---------03:37----------
going to check to see if there's 3.3

---------03:38----------
volts at lcd VDD and that's exactly what

---------03:41----------
you need to do over here there is a

---------03:43----------
couple of different power lines for your

---------03:45----------
LCD it's not like an iPhone so you have

---------03:48----------
one power line which is pp 3 v 3s o LCD

---------03:52----------
over here and this power line that's

---------03:54----------
going to pin 4 is going to the DDC part

---------03:58----------
of the LCD D DC is a protocol used for

---------04:02----------
you to be able to tell what type of

---------04:04----------
screen it is so what resolution what

---------04:06----------
refresh rate

---------04:07----------
what model am I so that's how the screen

---------04:10----------
is going to communicate with the machine

---------04:12----------
to tell what type of screen it is that

---------04:14----------
has to happen first

---------04:16----------
secondly you'll get three volts to the

---------04:18----------
LCD this is the part that actually

---------04:19----------
creates the image and that's on pins two

---------04:21----------
and three and the third power rail is

---------04:23----------
going to be backlight and that's the

---------04:25----------
last one to come on and that's on pins

---------04:27----------
21 and 22 but it typically follows this

---------04:30----------
order on the older Mac books that use

---------04:31----------
LVDS first you need 3.3 volts for the

---------04:34----------
DDC circuit so that you can see that

---------04:36----------
this inductor here is that's gonna be

---------04:38----------
sending power to DDC right behind it you

---------04:41----------
have the two pull ups for LVDS d DC

---------04:43----------
o'clock and d DC data that's how when

---------04:45----------
you plug in a new screen it

---------04:46----------
automatically tells what the resolution

---------04:48----------
is and all that good stuff think Apple

---------04:52----------
learned a lesson from past models issues

---------04:54----------
when new iPhones launch next month nope

---------04:56----------
now Jessa has a lot of really good

---------04:58----------
videos on the audio IC issues and you

---------05:00----------
should definitely check out her channel

---------05:01----------
it's called iPad rehab

---------05:02----------
that's iPad rehab there's a lot of good

---------05:04----------
content there so if you watch this stuff

---------05:06----------
you should definitely check out her

---------05:07----------
channel but she has a lot of videos and

---------05:09----------
something called the audio IC issue and

---------05:11----------
it occurs because the iPhone 7 if it

---------05:15----------
flexes so when you when you move it back

---------05:17----------
and forth it flexes very similar to how

---------05:19----------
the iPhone six-plus would flex and that

---------05:22----------
causes it to have flexion based damage

---------05:24----------
where pads will come off the board and

---------05:26----------
stuff like that under chips

---------05:28----------
so Apple figured out the problem and

---------05:31----------
fixed it with the 6s but then recreated

---------05:33----------
it in the 7 they don't learn from their

---------05:35----------
mistakes and I don't think they ever

---------05:38----------
will because people keep buying the

---------05:40----------
products so first you need your 3 volts

---------05:42----------
for your D DC circuit with any of these

---------05:44----------
LVDS model MacBooks then you need 3

---------05:46----------
volts for the image circuit which is LCD

---------05:49----------
VDD and then you need backlight now the

---------05:51----------
thing is even if you don't have full

---------05:53----------
voltage on image circuit backlight will

---------05:56----------
still come on backlight will still come

---------05:58----------
on so long as there's anything on LCD

---------06:00----------
VDD if you have anything over 0 on LCD

---------06:02----------
VDD backlight will come on especially if

---------06:05----------
the D DC circuit has come on and already

---------06:08----------
communicated with the Machine so now

---------06:09----------
what we have to do is correct this so

---------06:12----------
first thing we have to do is figure out

---------06:13----------
why this happened to begin with and see

---------06:15----------
if this occurred due to a short circuit

---------06:17----------
to ground on the image line so uh image

---------06:20----------
power line so I'm going to turn my meter

---------06:22----------
back on here thanks to this beautiful

---------06:24----------
stream deck that Paul got me

---------06:28----------
let's see if we have a short to ground

---------06:30----------
on the image line there's no short two

---------06:37----------
grounds on the image line alright so now

---------06:38----------
what we have to do is remove this and

---------06:40----------
well that's probably gonna be welded to

---------06:43----------
that pad this is something you'll also

---------06:44----------
see in some of Jesse's videos where the

---------06:46----------
especially I believe on the 6s no

---------06:48----------
backlight on a lot of success backlight

---------06:50----------
issues you'll notice that the filter

---------06:53----------
actually gets welded onto the pad and in

---------06:55----------
a way it's that that's a common iPhone

---------06:59----------
mess-up and that happens over here with

---------07:02----------
this filter now with the backlight fuse

---------07:03----------
but a lot with the filter and I'm gonna

---------07:05----------
finish this up as quickly as I can

---------07:06----------
because my ex-employee is in the front

---------07:08----------
of the store and I need to convince her

---------07:10----------
to come back and work here so I'm gonna

---------07:12----------
get on my hands and knees and grovel as

---------07:15----------
much as I can much groveling it's very

---------07:18----------
hard to find good employees when you

---------07:20----------
find them don't let them go ever

---------07:21----------
seriously like lock them in your

---------07:23----------
basement get a good security system put

---------07:25----------
a leash on them if you have to but don't

---------07:27----------
let them go especially in yeah do what

---------07:32----------
you got to do

---------07:38----------
should probably get a micro soldering

---------07:40----------
pencil over here

---------07:48----------
but I don't want to change

---------08:00----------
I am disabled teen i watch and do the

---------08:05----------
same well i think that's really cool

---------08:11----------
that you're not letting a disability get

---------08:12----------
in the way of doing this type of work

---------08:15----------
and if anybody tells you you can't do it

---------08:17----------
cause of a disability you can just tell

---------08:19----------
them to go after themselves okay so now

---------08:24----------
we have our inductor

---------08:58----------
I should reinforce that solder blob with

---------09:00----------
a wire

---------09:17----------
this is this is an example of sheer

---------09:19----------
stubbornness and laziness I don't want

---------09:22----------
to get up to get the micro pencil iron

---------09:23----------
and plug it into the hakko and hear the

---------09:25----------
beeping so I'm using this ridiculous BCM

---------09:28----------
to tip to do this job

---------09:30----------
jess is probably watching and screaming

---------09:31----------
at the screen right now because I'm

---------09:33----------
using a BCM to to micro solder but I

---------09:37----------
don't want to get up again it's so I'm

---------09:46----------
psycho soldering with a BCM - this is

---------09:52----------
pure stubborn stupidity you should do as

---------09:54----------
I say not as I do

---------09:55----------
just get yourself a duel station I

---------09:58----------
didn't get myself a duel station because

---------10:00----------
as an AGR ex investor I don't feel that

---------10:02----------
I'm I don't I'm worthy of it I don't

---------10:04----------
deserve it

---------10:06----------
anybody dumb enough to stay in a grx

---------10:09----------
does not deserve to have another station

---------10:20----------
all right and after this is done we're

---------10:23----------
going to test our work it's good and we

---------10:28----------
can fix up this firewire circuit later

---------10:30----------
the firewire circuit can wait because

---------10:31----------
you can see the firewire area doesn't

---------10:34----------
look very nice here

---------10:34----------
boom I'm just gonna let's just see if he

---------10:37----------
got image first an image first port that

---------10:40----------
nobody's used since 2010 later I have

---------10:47----------
one test for any to least Akkad iPad

---------10:48----------
rehab what I get up and walk across the

---------10:50----------
room to get this tool that's the thing

---------10:52----------
Jessa I that test doesn't work with me

---------10:54----------
due to the amount of laziness cuz

---------10:56----------
they're all I wouldn't get up to get a

---------10:58----------
lot of things that I genuinely need

---------11:02----------
alright let's see does this turn on or

---------11:04----------
blow up let's see if smoking myths so no

---------11:07----------
smoking myths from here and we have a

---------11:10----------
screen and hey we got an Apple logo the

---------11:12----------
Apple logo means that we do have image

---------11:14----------
so that is it for today and as always I

---------11:17----------
hope you learned something now I was

---------11:18----------
gonna plan a stream for a longer period

---------11:19----------
of time but I do have to go up to the

---------11:21----------
front and grovel and beg and get on my

---------11:23----------
knees and hope and pray and plead that

---------11:25----------
my ex-employee will come back to work

---------11:27----------
here because we there's just nobody like

---------11:29----------
veneer so that's it for today and as

---------11:31----------
always I hope you learned something time

---------11:34----------
to get the groveling

---------11:42----------
don't delay by today

---------11:45----------
