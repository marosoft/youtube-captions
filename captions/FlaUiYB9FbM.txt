---------00:00----------
okay let's see what we have on the other

---------00:02----------
side of this board plug this in

---------00:14----------
thank you so much this Vicki Shore for a

---------00:16----------
thousand Thunderbolts bp3 before - is

---------00:21----------
present TP bus is present but low

---------00:25----------
meaning the SMC is not turning on

---------00:27----------
meaning it's an SMC issue or an SMC

---------00:29----------
reset issue is SMC reset higher law SMC

---------00:33----------
reset is one point forty four volts so

---------00:36----------
we have an issue with SMC reset circuit

---------00:38----------
or SMC all right let's remove SMC reset

---------00:45----------
chip and if we remove the SMC reset ship

---------00:47----------
and SMC reset is high we're lucky and

---------00:50----------
all this board would need is an SMC

---------00:53----------
reset [ __ ] if we remove the SMC reset

---------00:56----------
chip on this board and it doesn't work

---------00:59----------
that means the SMC is pulling it down so

---------01:03----------
and I will go over the why of that the

---------01:06----------
moment I remove this chip

---------01:12----------
okay chip removed so let's just open up

---------01:15----------
a schematic and a board view for the 8 -

---------01:18----------
0 - 35 36 that this is so I can show you

---------01:24----------
all what's going on there 8 - 0 3 5 3 6

---------01:29----------
now there's no green light in the charge

---------01:31----------
and in order to have a green light in

---------01:33----------
the charger what ah

---------01:38----------
wait out no no okay in order to have a

---------01:41----------
green light on the charger I need 4 PP 3

---------01:46----------
V 4 to underscore g3 ought to be present

---------01:48----------
pp 3 before to underscore g3 hot so here

---------01:51----------
this chip is gonna pass pp 3 before to

---------01:55----------
underscore g3 outs of this chip this

---------01:56----------
chip is going to take the adapter sends

---------01:58----------
signal and sends it over to the system

---------02:01----------
management controller on the SIS 1 wire

---------02:03----------
line since one wire here is gonna go to

---------02:05----------
the SMC chip that's what's gonna turn

---------02:07----------
the charger on now our charger is not

---------02:08----------
turning on right now the charger as you

---------02:10----------
saw is not turning green or orange the

---------02:14----------
SMC itself is going to turn on when SMC

---------02:18----------
reset L is present SMC reset L is a

---------02:22----------
signal that's going to keep the SMC from

---------02:23----------
trying to turn on before all the power

---------02:25----------
as I've stabilized this chip is going to

---------02:27----------
keep SMC reset L low for maybe a 100 to

---------02:29----------
200 milliseconds think of it like a

---------02:30----------
brownout detector it's just gonna make

---------02:32----------
sure that people through before - is

---------02:34----------
exactly 3.42 volts before it turns on

---------02:36----------
now there's two ways I can tell before I

---------02:38----------
even measure SMC reset l at the SMC is

---------02:40----------
off the SMC not chosen to communicate

---------02:43----------
with the charger it also communicates

---------02:44----------
with the chip that creates voltage

---------02:45----------
required for the Machine use 7100 which

---------02:48----------
is gonna create PP but g3 hi see over

---------02:50----------
here we have an SMC data line over here

---------02:52----------
the data line at the bi-directional data

---------02:54----------
line speaking with this chip and this

---------02:56----------
chip is creating PP bunch d3 hot at the

---------02:58----------
wrong voltage it's creating it at 12.20

---------02:59----------
3 rather than 12 point 56 and it usually

---------03:02----------
creates at a 12 point 56 in the SMC

---------03:04----------
works 12 point 23 when it doesn't no

---------03:06----------
thanks thank you

---------03:10----------
so let's see what we get over here what

---------03:14----------
now that we have turned off the we've

---------03:17----------
removed the SMC resettle chip so when I

---------03:19----------
plug this in as you can see we get a

---------03:22----------
green light on the charger it's not

---------03:24----------
going to turn on because

---------03:25----------
is SMC they're not going to turn on so

---------03:28----------
as you can see here after moving the SMC

---------03:29----------
reset chip we are getting a green light

---------03:32----------
on the charger and we're also getting

---------03:33----------
three point four volts on SMC reset

---------03:36----------
meaning this is most likely a problem

---------03:37----------
with SMC reset so let me just get a

---------03:43----------
replacement chip from a donor thank you

---------03:46----------
and now for this board that has already

---------03:49----------
remote place SMC and a jagged looking

---------03:52----------
SMC reset chip

---------03:59----------
that's fine okay Oh Mako yeah I'll just

---------04:03----------
ask out but I'll sell me one that'll

---------04:05----------
that'll go great all right so we do this

---------04:07----------
and we're gonna replace that ship with

---------04:12----------
another one

---------04:16----------
and once this works my accountants

---------04:19----------
assistance machine will work and

---------04:20----------
hopefully he can go back to making sure

---------04:22----------
that I don't get owned by the IRS and

---------04:30----------
yeah

---------04:35----------
okay you bet

---------05:16----------
so hopefully you understand why it is

---------05:18----------
that I checked PP but g3 hot to confirm

---------05:20----------
that the SMC was off and I hope you

---------05:23----------
understand why it is that 12 point 28

---------05:25----------
volts versus 12 point 56 volts means

---------05:27----------
something to me

---------05:28----------
the chip that creates BP budged III hoc

---------05:30----------
communicates with the SMC and this wear

---------05:32----------
pattern recognition comes in handy

---------05:34----------
because I don't have a manual for this

---------05:35----------
or anything like that it's just that

---------05:36----------
every single time that the SMC has been

---------05:39----------
corroded or broken or this not working

---------05:41----------
right or it's not turning on I get 12

---------05:43----------
point 28 versus when it works I get 12

---------05:45----------
point 56 so I've associated in my head

---------05:47----------
that when the assistant management

---------05:49----------
controller is working I will get 12

---------05:51----------
point 56 volts and when it's not working

---------05:53----------
I'll get 12 point 28 volts I need your

---------05:55----------
quarterly filings please says IRS what

---------05:59----------
get out of here get tough

---------06:07----------
get the [ __ ] out of my store we are

---------06:09----------
closed anyway back to this let's see if

---------06:13----------
this thing it gives me fan spin now that

---------06:14----------
we replace the SMC SMC reset lic

---------06:35----------
and it works beautiful lovely so now

---------06:39----------
this machine works now we move on to

---------06:41----------
some more important questions

---------06:43----------
why are my company's finance is being

---------06:45----------
held on a MacBook MacBook like the [ __ ]

---------06:55----------
the shitty companies okay just making

---------06:57----------
sure

---------07:01----------
okay can you hand this to one of the

---------07:05----------
three people in the front and just say

---------07:06----------
Louis asked if you could please

---------07:08----------
reassemble this and it'll be set in

---------07:10----------
working no more MacBook I will actually
