---------00:00----------
so this is a 17-inch MacBook Pro this is

---------00:02----------
a machine that is from 2009 it says that

---------00:05----------
there's treasure in your soul these

---------00:06----------
machines have a very very common problem

---------00:08----------
where it is they won't start this

---------00:09----------
circuit over here that creates P P 1 vo

---------00:11----------
5s v MC P this is where the problem

---------00:14----------
typically lies this power rail will wind

---------00:16----------
up being point 3 volts instead of its

---------00:18----------
proper one point 0 5 volts so we're

---------00:20----------
gonna measure and see if that's the case

---------00:22----------
on this model board this is where that

---------00:23----------
little capacitor is and you can see this

---------00:25----------
board actually is silk-screening

---------00:26----------
look at that that must have been a

---------00:28----------
mistake whoever did this at Apple must

---------00:30----------
have been fired so as you can see we're

---------00:31----------
getting 319 millivolt you'll see it's

---------00:33----------
point three two volts now watch this

---------00:35----------
this is the fun part watch what happens

---------00:38----------
if I heat that

---------00:47----------
watch what happens if I heat this

---------00:49----------
tantalum capacitor alright so I heated

---------00:52----------
it up to 500 Celsius now I'm turning the

---------00:56----------
machine on again and I measure I get 1

---------01:00----------
point 1 3 volts check that out see that

---------01:03----------
that's magic so what's going on there is

---------01:05----------
that the capacitor is not the right one

---------01:06----------
for the circuit however it was used

---------01:08----------
because when they were putting together

---------01:09----------
the circuit the Apple engineers ran out

---------01:11----------
of room so you can see there's not a lot

---------01:13----------
of room for me to put a different

---------01:14----------
capacitor so I'm gonna have to kind of

---------01:16----------
reorganize this area to fit the proper

---------01:18----------
capacitor so what I'm gonna do is I'm

---------01:19----------
going to move the coil upwards and then

---------01:21----------
I'm going to solder with my capacitor in

---------01:23----------
under there and if you needed to buy a

---------01:25----------
capacitor for this model machine if you

---------01:27----------
wanted to buy a replacement capacitor

---------01:28----------
that's going to work properly well look

---------01:31----------
no further then stored

---------01:33----------
Rossmann groov.com don't delay bye today

---------01:36----------
available for only seven dollars and 69

---------01:39----------
cents one thing that's very very

---------01:40----------
important here very important is that we

---------01:43----------
do not heat up the mCP this is the mCP

---------01:46----------
chip under the heatsink I'm keeping the

---------01:47----------
heatsink gone for good reason right now

---------01:49----------
even though I'm gonna replace the

---------01:50----------
thermal paste is because I want the heat

---------01:52----------
to go away from that ship I do not want

---------01:56----------
to heat that that is a bad thing to do

---------01:58----------
so we're going to remove that old

---------02:00----------
capacitor repeal and replace it with a

---------02:03----------
better one this is really funny because

---------02:10----------
a lot of MacBooks get killed from

---------02:12----------
overheating and this one gets killed

---------02:14----------
from being too cold I love it some

---------02:20----------
MacBooks die if they're too hot some

---------02:23----------
MacBooks die if they're too cold and

---------02:25----------
some MacBooks die even when everything's

---------02:27----------
just right you gotta love it so I've

---------02:31----------
removed the offending capacitor and now

---------02:33----------
I'm gonna move this coil up I'm gonna

---------02:36----------
add a little bit of flux on each side

---------02:38----------
and I'm gonna use that to heat up this

---------02:41----------
coil and I'm gonna move it up a little

---------02:44----------
bit just a little bit so that I can fit

---------02:48----------
my larger capacitor in that space

---------02:50----------
comfortably

---------02:58----------
there we go I'm gonna push it down on it

---------03:01----------
to make sure it's nicely on the board

---------03:03----------
and some reefs are dying it had some

---------03:07----------
flux here some flux there you're gonna

---------03:10----------
make sure that this is nicely soldered

---------03:12----------
onto our board that coil is indeed

---------03:15----------
crooked oh well make sure it's soldered

---------03:25----------
with some nice fresh solder

---------03:33----------
don't want that coil falling off of the

---------03:35----------
board now do we

---------03:46----------
we can add some flux set up our

---------03:50----------
beautiful new capacitor here and some

---------03:55----------
solder just 10 the pads a little bit but

---------03:58----------
a bing bada boom as we can see on the

---------04:08----------
schematic and board view the left side

---------04:10----------
of this capacitor is going to be the

---------04:12----------
positive terminal that's going to be our

---------04:14----------
one point zero five volt line and the

---------04:17----------
right terminal is going to be the ground

---------04:18----------
terminal if we look at our capacitor

---------04:20----------
over here our capacitor has three pads

---------04:22----------
and it also has a bar so the bar is

---------04:25----------
going to be the positive end of this

---------04:27----------
capacitor and what we want to do is

---------04:29----------
solder this in in a manner where this

---------04:32----------
pad is going to ground and this pad is

---------04:34----------
going a positive this and this are both

---------04:36----------
the negative terminal of this capacitor

---------04:38----------
so this is cool because it allows me to

---------04:40----------
fit the large capacitor where the small

---------04:41----------
capacitor would have gone and it also

---------04:43----------
seems like I need to move up my coil

---------04:45----------
just a little bit if I'm gonna fit this

---------04:46----------
in there comfortably so I'm gonna just

---------04:48----------
heat it up one more time and move that

---------04:50----------
coil up a teeny tiny bit just so that I

---------04:54----------
can get my capacitor snugly fit

---------05:27----------
all right there we go so our coil is

---------05:32----------
still soldered to the board make sure

---------05:34----------
that it's nice and snug and secure since

---------05:36----------
this is a large component don't want it

---------05:38----------
falling off or away

---------05:40----------
push down solder got flux in the other

---------05:46----------
side of it push down solder keep pushing

---------05:53----------
down wait for it to dry beautiful so

---------05:56----------
that coil is nice and secure on my board

---------05:58----------
now we're gonna put some flux over here

---------06:01----------
so that the the solder on the pads

---------06:04----------
underneath the capacitor will melt

---------06:06----------
nicely and after doing that little

---------06:08----------
relocation grab this capacitor and now

---------06:13----------
it fits look at that so you can see the

---------06:18----------
little bars over here and those bars are

---------06:21----------
going on the middle of the capacitor

---------06:23----------
those are the bars that are supposed to

---------06:25----------
be going to the ground pad which is the

---------06:27----------
center one

---------06:34----------
and I scratched my capacitor a little

---------06:36----------
bit but oh well

---------06:38----------
the MacBooks not gonna care it's not

---------06:44----------
gonna care I guess I won't be able to

---------06:45----------
get full resale value for this MacBook

---------06:47----------
now that it's Cee 7/7 won and scratched

---------06:49----------
but as you can see it's nicely soldered

---------06:52----------
in there and I'm gonna wait for that to

---------06:53----------
cool off a moment before I put it back

---------06:55----------
on since unlike the tantalum capacitor

---------06:57----------
that I was testing this is a capacitor

---------06:58----------
that I actually care about I would like

---------07:00----------
for this to last and the clean off the

---------07:03----------
section also while I'm cleaning this

---------07:05----------
section of the board off and waiting for

---------07:07----------
it to cool off I'm thinking that it

---------07:08----------
would be a nice thing to do to just

---------07:09----------
replace that old thermal paste since

---------07:11----------
that old thermal paste is gonna be crap

---------07:12----------
look at this junk caked up dried old

---------07:18----------
junk I have to do it without the

---------07:23----------
microscope because if I do it with the

---------07:24----------
microscope I'm just gonna sit here all

---------07:25----------
day cleaning it as you can see it is

---------07:27----------
booted into my test operating system and

---------07:30----------
this little SSD over here and it is

---------07:32----------
running fur mark now you can see that

---------07:34----------
since this computer is damn near 10

---------07:35----------
years old it's going at about point 2

---------07:37----------
frames per second this is 1920 by 1200

---------07:39----------
resolution and it's at 2x anti analyzing

---------07:43----------
but not only is that MCP chip which acts

---------07:45----------
as a graphics chip working it's even

---------07:47----------
able to run graphics intensive

---------07:49----------
applications there's no need to Rabaul

---------07:51----------
it or replace it or heatgun it all you

---------07:53----------
had to do was replace the capacitor

---------07:55----------
providing it with the power that it

---------07:56----------
needed to turn on that capacitor failed

---------07:58----------
and wasn't able to store the power

---------07:59----------
anymore some Apple products will stop

---------08:01----------
working if they get too hot this is an

---------08:03----------
Apple product that'll stop working if it

---------08:05----------
gets too cold so if you're not able to

---------08:07----------
replace the capacitor to fix your

---------08:08----------
problem you could go someplace warmer

---------08:10----------
like hell and then your MacBook will

---------08:12----------
already work but if you're using an

---------08:14----------
Apple product chances are you're already

---------08:16----------
there that's it for today and as always

---------08:18----------
I hope you learned something

---------08:27----------
you
