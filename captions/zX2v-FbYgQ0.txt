---------00:00----------
so this is a macbook air this if

---------00:01----------
anything the old macbook air not the

---------00:04----------
oldest but the old 2013 or 2017 this

---------00:06----------
should be the easiest thing on earth to

---------00:07----------
fix

---------00:11----------
and i see this

---------00:15----------
what the [ __ ] this is like the third

---------00:19----------
machine that i've opened

---------00:21----------
in the last day where it got destroyed

---------00:26----------
before i got to do anything with it i

---------00:29----------
don't like that

---------00:35----------
okay so what what happened what did you

---------00:38----------
do

---------00:39----------
what does my charger say

---------00:44----------
my charger says that you take eight

---------00:47----------
milliamps what the hell is that what is

---------00:49----------
eight milliamps all right

---------00:52----------
let's take the board out of the case and

---------00:53----------
go from there okay

---------00:55----------
this is an h0 34 37

---------00:58----------
this board should be fixable there's no

---------01:00----------
such thing as an 820 3437 that's not

---------01:02----------
fixable

---------01:03----------
they're always fixable always fixable

---------01:06----------
this is supposed to be easy breezy

---------01:07----------
beautiful cover girl

---------01:10----------
the first thing i'm going to do is you

---------01:12----------
need to measure pp3 or 4200 square g3

---------01:14----------
hop because that's required to get a

---------01:15----------
green light we don't have a green light

---------01:17----------
if you don't know why that is watch any

---------01:18----------
one of my millions of one wire circuit

---------01:20----------
videos or i've explained this concept a

---------01:22----------
million times to the point where i will

---------01:24----------
i just can't explain it again because i

---------01:26----------
just can't explain it again

---------01:28----------
so that's the inductor on which we'll

---------01:29----------
see pp3 before to underscore g3 hop

---------01:36----------
3.0 is not 3.42 my friend

---------01:40----------
what the hell's going on here all right

---------01:41----------
so do we have charger voltage coming

---------01:43----------
through

---------01:46----------
charger voltage is coming through all

---------01:48----------
right

---------01:50----------
let's take a look in the microscope

---------01:57----------
what is this is this solid right it does

---------02:00----------
not look solid right

---------02:20----------
so

---------02:24----------
that looks like some corroded [ __ ]

---------02:39----------
[Music]

---------03:02----------
so

---------03:10----------
[Music]

---------03:16----------

---------03:20----------
[Music]

---------03:30----------
so

---------03:32----------
[Music]

---------03:34----------
3.4

---------03:37----------
is smc reset present let's see what's

---------03:40----------
our pp bus

---------03:43----------
oh [ __ ] you pp bus is low

---------03:48----------
all right is smc reset present smc reset

---------03:50----------
needs to be

---------03:52----------
3.42 smc needs to be turning on

---------03:55----------
[Music]

---------03:58----------
smc reset is high

---------04:02----------
[Music]

---------04:05----------
do you need an smc

---------04:09----------
do you need an smc you probably need an

---------04:13----------
smc don't you

---------04:16----------
oh and you're not going to get an smc

---------04:18----------
though you're going to get a re-hot

---------05:12----------
all right so what you're hearing right

---------05:15----------
now that's the overhead camera

---------05:17----------
my overhead camera has a mic built into

---------05:19----------
it but it's a piece of [ __ ]

---------05:20----------
it sounds like crap but thank you very

---------05:23----------
