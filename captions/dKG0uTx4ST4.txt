---------00:00----------
all right so today I want to talk about

---------00:01----------
a basic topic when it comes to

---------00:03----------
troubleshooting some of these circuits

---------00:05----------
and this is something that comes in

---------00:06----------
handy if you haven't known good around

---------00:08----------
so this is a machine that has no

---------00:10----------
backlight on the screen and it's

---------00:12----------
something I've mentioned in a couple of

---------00:13----------
prior videos but it's not something that

---------00:14----------
has its own dedicated video and it

---------00:16----------
should because this is a really this

---------00:18----------
basic concept in electronics and it's

---------00:21----------
something that's gonna help you along in

---------00:22----------
your troubleshooting so if let's say

---------00:24----------
that we have a circuit that is it that

---------00:27----------
it's supposed to create a certain amount

---------00:28----------
of brightness for the screen a certain

---------00:29----------
amount of voltage for the screen and it

---------00:31----------
knows what the load of the screen is

---------00:33----------
going to be let's say if we want to

---------00:35----------
create 27 volts now the output of a

---------00:39----------
circuit can actually give you an idea of

---------00:41----------
what's going on with it so here I'm

---------00:44----------
gonna measure backlight output at a

---------00:45----------
specific point in the circuit and I get

---------00:49----------
thirty nine point six volts now this is

---------00:52----------
where again one of the things that

---------00:53----------
really helps me is having this whole

---------00:56----------
pile of stuff that works well some of it

---------00:58----------
works where I can just go okay what's

---------00:59----------
that supposed to be and I measure it and

---------01:01----------
I have an answer and it kind of helps me

---------01:03----------
with my thought process so I'm so I know

---------01:05----------
that I'm supporting machine when

---------01:07----------
brightness is all the way up I get 27

---------01:08----------
volts so why is my voltage 39.6

---------01:12----------
that means I should have more light

---------01:14----------
right now what a lot of people will say

---------01:16----------
is oh the screen must be broken or that

---------01:18----------
the light got blown out because the

---------01:20----------
board was delivering too much voltage

---------01:21----------
that's what I hear from a lot of new

---------01:22----------
students and a lot of people when I ask

---------01:24----------
them this question rhetorically the real

---------01:26----------
issue here is that there is no path to

---------01:28----------
the screen so I want you to think of

---------01:30----------
this don't you think this kind like

---------01:32----------
channel competent analogy here my nose

---------01:36----------
is stuffed and it's screwing up my brain

---------01:38----------
okay let's say you have an arm wrestling

---------01:40----------
match right and you're pushing as hard

---------01:42----------
as you can you're pushing as hard as you

---------01:43----------
can but you're not but you're not

---------01:45----------
falling down then if I let go for a

---------01:48----------
second so there's no load you'll in

---------01:50----------
storm is gonna move down onto the table

---------01:52----------
really really fast so before when I was

---------01:54----------
resisting you your arm was really moving

---------01:57----------
really really slowly but then when I

---------01:59----------
stopped resisting you even though using

---------02:00----------
the same amount of pressure your arm is

---------02:02----------
gonna move really really fast because

---------02:03----------
there's no push back so this it's kind

---------02:06----------
of the same thing going on here

---------02:07----------
so this is supposed to British 27 volts

---------02:09----------
when a screen which presents a load to

---------02:12----------
the circuit some resistance

---------02:13----------
back to the circuit is connected but

---------02:15----------
there isn't but if there's a break in

---------02:17----------
the line that same circuit is then gonna

---------02:19----------
produce more voltage so you'll see 39 at

---------02:21----------
the end of it instead of 27 so it is

---------02:24----------
producing voltage but that voltage is

---------02:25----------
not actually connect it to anything

---------02:27----------
which is why the vote what you're seeing

---------02:29----------
is higher now if you look along in the

---------02:31----------
circuit

---------02:31----------
the theory is then going to match

---------02:33----------
reality because if I go over here and

---------02:35----------
put the camera over the connector you'll

---------02:39----------
see that it's quite clearly see

---------02:44----------
 very

---------02:53----------
they're killing me so the pins are

---------02:56----------
broken so there's no path so if you

---------03:03----------
think of things in these terms becomes

---------03:05----------
easier to figure things out one of the

---------03:08----------
things I like to get across here is that

---------03:10----------
most of the stuff that people think is

---------03:12----------
magic and crazy engineering is is common

---------03:15----------
sense and when you start to see all this

---------03:17----------
common sense it then becomes that much

---------03:19----------
more accessible to you what can I get

---------03:22----------
you yes what happened to mother piece of

---------03:31----------


---------03:34----------
my FM 20:32 died oh well

---------03:42----------
luckily I have a spare

---------04:19----------
you have to realize that if electronics

---------04:21----------
were anything other than common sense

---------04:23----------
you'd never it would have never been

---------04:26----------
something that a dumbass like me would

---------04:27----------
have been able to get my head around

---------04:33----------
weight you can take this micro pencil

---------04:38----------
weight so that the big iron is the one

---------04:40----------
that died oshizu okay that means I have

---------04:46----------
to try to wick a connector with a micro

---------04:48----------
pencil this should be fun I'm glad that

---------04:53----------
one died because that one is much

---------04:54----------
cheaper ah so now the most expensive

---------05:01----------
portion of it is broken

---------05:14----------
okay how much of this can I get done

---------05:16----------
with a micro pencil

---------05:31----------
see we're gonna bring those pads back

---------05:34----------
really Louis you're scraping is too hard

---------05:37----------
Louis what you're doing is not properly

---------05:39----------
Louis this is too much you're rough on

---------05:44----------
this stuff I don't think a lot of people

---------05:45----------
realize that like half of the stuff that

---------05:47----------
I'm working on has been sitting in

---------05:49----------
coca-cola

---------05:49----------
for two years or cat piss before it gets

---------05:55----------
here

---------05:56----------
like there's different soldering

---------06:00----------
technique that you're going to use when

---------06:03----------
you're working on something that looks

---------06:04----------
like it's been pissed on that's had

---------06:06----------
power be going through it for two years

---------06:08----------
as it's been pissed on then you're going

---------06:11----------
to use on a single layer PC board that's

---------06:15----------
never been abused that just needs a

---------06:17----------
single component replaced

---------06:27----------
so this is obviously not the proper iron

---------06:30----------
to be doing this with but equipment

---------06:32----------
issues let's see how long I'll be doing

---------06:36----------
this for ya that's gonna take forever

---------06:45----------
what do you want micro pencil yeah we

---------06:48----------
did you figure out what's wrong the tip

---------06:55----------
died which one just give me the name so

---------06:59----------
I can buy another one or five of them at

---------07:02----------
the end of today how does it how does

---------07:08----------
the tip actually die

---------07:12----------
I never get them to die I just wind up

---------07:22----------
bending them to the point that I can't

---------07:23----------
recognize them there we go much better

---------07:34----------
come on

---------07:39----------
yeah

---------07:51----------
ideally I'd be using one of the flat

---------07:53----------
tips for this but I don't have one

---------07:54----------
he had one but it died mine died too and

---------07:57----------
I've just been using this one it's

---------07:59----------
really good as a multi-purpose tip you

---------08:02----------
save a lot of time if you don't change

---------08:03----------
tips in time and this business is

---------08:05----------
important because again as I say you

---------08:08----------
will receive a phone call from people 5

---------08:11----------
10 15 times a day asking if it's done

---------08:13----------
yet and my god the they will say to

---------08:17----------
you if it's not see that that's ripped

---------08:19----------
off now but that's totally fine because

---------08:21----------
I'm gonna be running a wire there anyway

---------08:27----------
if it looks that bad I always wind up

---------08:30----------
running a wire instead of trust in the

---------08:31----------
pad

---------08:40----------
yeah I don't always care so much about

---------08:42----------
it looking factory I care about it being

---------08:44----------
fixed that it never comes back here

---------08:50----------
ideally I would never see this person

---------08:53----------
again maybe at a birthday party

---------09:01----------
maybe at a Broadway show maybe in line

---------09:06----------
at the DMV but hopefully I won't see

---------09:08----------
them again with this piece of crap

---------09:09----------
computer

---------09:10----------
the idea is to fix it so that you never

---------09:13----------
see them again so

---------09:25----------
but some people said neither you know oh

---------09:26----------
I can't believe you say things like you

---------09:28----------
never want to see your customers again

---------09:30----------
chillax

---------09:32----------
people take the things in the worst

---------09:34----------
possible way it's like worse than my ex

---------09:38----------
relationships that's how you know

---------09:40----------
usually in a bad relationship with your

---------09:42----------
significant other is when there's five

---------09:44----------
different ways anything you say can be

---------09:45----------
interpreted and they interpret it in the

---------09:47----------
worst possible way I kind of think

---------09:49----------
that's what the youtube comment section

---------09:50----------
is the internet in general what I mean

---------09:56----------
when I say that I don't want to see

---------09:57----------
somebody again it means that I want to

---------10:00----------
do the job to the point where they never

---------10:04----------
have another problem and they don't have

---------10:05----------
to come back meaning that I've done my

---------10:07----------
job well the problem is solved it's like

---------10:13----------
it's supposed to be a good thing like

---------10:15----------
not just for me but for them don't know

---------10:20----------
how that lines up getting turned into

---------10:21----------
hate

---------10:27----------
that's horrible we're off to a horrible

---------10:30----------
start

---------10:49----------
don't get me wrong there are some people

---------10:51----------
that I would never want to see again on

---------10:55----------
a DMV line at a partyer purgatory there

---------10:59----------
are some people I just know but for the

---------11:00----------
most part I mean it in a happy positive

---------11:03----------
way

---------11:20----------
this is the but you got to be careful

---------11:21----------
with a lot of people put too much cider

---------11:24----------
here and then they can't get the damn

---------11:25----------
LCD cable stuck in there you don't need

---------11:30----------
a lot you just need enough

---------11:41----------
think of this like drinking when you're

---------11:43----------
putting a soda on the sides of the LCD

---------11:45----------
connector you don't need a lot you just

---------11:48----------
need enough

---------11:49----------
once you feel buzzed you can stop

---------11:52----------
drinking you're welcome to keep drinking

---------11:56----------
after you're buzzed but it's probably

---------11:58----------
not going to end well

---------12:25----------
thank you

---------12:33----------
this is another thing when it comes to

---------12:35----------
fixing other stuff like I get people

---------12:37----------
emailing me a lot saying you know can

---------12:39----------
you fix this oven thing can you fix this

---------12:42----------
this thing from my pool this PC board

---------12:45----------
and this that and the other and I

---------12:47----------
usually say no to those things they in I

---------12:49----------
don't haven't known working I don't have

---------12:51----------
a manual I don't have parts that I can

---------12:52----------
just grab off a donor board or any of

---------12:54----------
that but where am I gonna find donor

---------12:56----------
parts first though you know a pool or a

---------13:00----------
Jacuzzi PC board or anything like that

---------13:02----------
so I stopped saying no recently because

---------13:05----------
I didn't want to make it me I didn't

---------13:06----------
want to make it that I'm saying no so

---------13:07----------
what I do now is I tell people just turn

---------13:11----------
the stamp filter off what I do is I tell

---------13:15----------
people yeah I'll work on it

---------13:17----------
so okay so how much is it I don't know

---------13:19----------
so is the estimate free No

---------13:21----------
so how does it work well I will bill you

---------13:23----------
when it's done okay so how long does it

---------13:25----------
take I don't know why not okay I don't

---------13:28----------
fix jacuzzis if you'd like to find

---------13:32----------
somebody that fixes jacuzzis that's

---------13:34----------
great it's not that I won't do it it's

---------13:37----------
just it'll be done under my my very very

---------13:40----------
undesirable terms really you know

---------13:45----------
there's not there's no real such thing

---------13:46----------
as a free estimate I mean okay I offer a

---------13:49----------
free estimate but I offer of just

---------13:51----------
checking for a short to ground I offer a

---------13:53----------
free estimate based on the fact that I

---------13:55----------
have like thousands of dollars in

---------13:57----------
inventory that allows me to check every

---------13:59----------
single thing that it could be if I

---------14:01----------
didn't have thousands of dollars in

---------14:02----------
inventory I'd have to buy thousands of

---------14:04----------
dollars in inventory to offer the free

---------14:06----------
estimate it's free for me now because I

---------14:08----------
invested in all that stuff years ago but

---------14:10----------
they're gonna you know somebody brings

---------14:14----------
me some like board that's worth 250

---------14:16----------
bucks I'm not gonna that I can only

---------14:18----------
repair 450 am I going to bring some $50

---------14:23----------
my gun is like if I can't fix her 50

---------14:26----------
bucks am I gonna buy another $200 board

---------14:28----------
just to have a donor now I could charge

---------14:33----------
you for it but nobody wants to pay for

---------14:35----------
that which is fine that's why I do this

---------14:38----------
just a tacky just in case you're curious

---------14:40----------
if you've asked if I want to do some

---------14:42----------
other type of repair and I've said no

---------14:45----------
I'm changing my policy

---------14:47----------
I will just now do it with the terms of

---------14:50----------
I don't know what it will cost I'll bill

---------14:51----------
you when it's done you won't know until

---------14:53----------
it's done what it'll cost and there's no

---------14:57----------
free estimate it would literally be the

---------14:58----------
exact opposite of my present model so

---------15:01----------
that's the only way can be economically

---------15:03----------
viable to do any of that stuff so 27

---------15:06----------
point 77 volts and as you can see

---------15:09----------
there's a light see there's a light so

---------15:14----------
when you have a voltage that is higher

---------15:16----------
than the voltage that you want on output

---------15:19----------
usually that could mean that there's

---------15:21----------
actually a break in the line

---------15:22----------
particularly with any of these DC to DC

---------15:23----------
boost circuits where it's expecting a

---------15:25----------
certain voltage at a certain point I

---------15:28----------
really would like to work on some other

---------15:30----------
stuff I honestly would it's just it's

---------15:33----------
it's not like a mean thing it's just

---------15:34----------
it's got to make sense it's got to make

---------15:37----------
sense it's got to be something where

---------15:39----------
like again like if I spent three hours

---------15:42----------
on it am i spending three hours for two

---------15:45----------
for 20 bucks and like no fix no fee it's

---------15:48----------
just the reason no fix no fee works so

---------15:50----------
well is because I know that there's such

---------15:52----------
a high likelihood of me being successful

---------15:54----------
and I know the price that people are

---------15:58----------
willing to pay but if it's like no no

---------16:00----------
fix no fee doesn't work on like 40 or 20

---------16:03----------
to 40 dollars stuff just doesn't like if

---------16:07----------
you if you're if you're in that if

---------16:09----------
you're in that market where it's like

---------16:10----------
where it's like 20 to 40 bucks a job

---------16:13----------
because people always ask that they go

---------16:14----------
you know how is it that you charge so

---------16:17----------
much do you watch my three-hour videos

---------16:20----------
do you watch my three-hour videos where

---------16:22----------
I spent three hours on something and it

---------16:23----------
still doesn't work you know I could

---------16:27----------
charge the person that I didn't fix

---------16:29----------
anything for they'll find that unfair I

---------16:31----------
could charge the fixes more money

---------16:33----------
they'll find that unfair but it really

---------16:35----------
comes down to what people are willing to

---------16:36----------
live with when I notices people are

---------16:39----------
willing to spend a little bit more to

---------16:41----------
have a no fix no fee than they are to

---------16:44----------
pay to live like a hundred bucks to

---------16:45----------
literally find out that something

---------16:47----------
doesn't work but it's all it's all in

---------16:50----------
the business model so that's that for

---------16:52----------
today as always I hope you learned some
