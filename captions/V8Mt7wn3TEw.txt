---------00:00----------
okay so today we're gonna be going over

---------00:01----------
a retina board that does not turn on so

---------00:04----------
the issue that this one is having is you

---------00:05----------
plug in the power you don't get a green

---------00:08----------
light and nothing happens so one of the

---------00:10----------
first things that I noticed when I

---------00:12----------
plugged this in I left this plugged in

---------00:13----------
for about a minute is that it some

---------00:15----------
components get really really hot I

---------00:17----------
noticed because when I went to unplug it

---------00:18----------
I touch the board and I burn myself so

---------00:21----------
let's go on to look in that area and get

---------00:22----------
an idea of what it is that's going on

---------00:24----------
and why it's burning I also probably

---------00:26----------
should have noticed that because it

---------00:28----------
smelled really really bad when I went to

---------00:30----------
pick it up and that should have been an

---------00:31----------
indicator that I should not have touched

---------00:33----------
it so if you look over here you're gonna

---------00:34----------
see that these two components look

---------00:36----------
really really nasty they look burned

---------00:38----------
over here and over here so what we're

---------00:40----------
gonna do is we're going to go over to

---------00:42----------
the board view and see what those things

---------00:45----------
are so when I go over to the board view

---------00:47----------
I'm gonna look and see what these things

---------00:49----------
are and I see that it's our 6920 and our

---------00:54----------
6905 so our 6920 okay by the way a lot

---------01:02----------
of people said I should try out Foxit I

---------01:03----------
honestly didn't even bother going to the

---------01:05----------
settings I spend two maybe five seconds

---------01:07----------
trying to figure out to get rid of those

---------01:08----------
huge bars that show up in the top and

---------01:10----------
when I couldn't I just gave up so I

---------01:12----------
figured out I can drag around this PDF

---------01:14----------
reader with all ten I'm just gonna all

---------01:15----------
tab to other things so our 6905 here is

---------01:19----------
shot and our 6920 here these two are

---------01:23----------
both burned alright so with with our

---------01:25----------
6905 and our 69 2004 it's pretty simple

---------01:30----------
so this is pp 3 v4 - this is a power

---------01:33----------
supply for the machine now this is one

---------01:35----------
of the few power supplies that turns on

---------01:36----------
before everything else turns on so it's

---------01:38----------
it's own separate power supply on this

---------01:40----------
machine

---------01:40----------
pp Bush g3 ha PP on this machine PP 5 vs

---------01:45----------
3 PP 5 vs 5 PP 3 V 3 all the other power

---------01:49----------
supplies they turn on based on pp bus g3

---------01:52----------
hot this is a power supply that can

---------01:54----------
actually work independently of pp bus g3

---------01:56----------
Hunt if you're plugging the charger in

---------01:58----------
so over here you can see that its

---------02:01----------
sources power from either pp bus g3 hot

---------02:04----------
or its source is powered directly from

---------02:06----------
the charger and there's this little

---------02:07----------
diode over here so the way this works is

---------02:09----------
pretty simple so you have P P but P P 3

---------02:11----------
before to underscore g3 hot over here

---------02:13----------
this is one of the few power supplies

---------02:15----------
that turns itself on to create the green

---------02:17----------
light on the charger before any power

---------02:19----------
actually starts getting made for the

---------02:20----------
machine well if all the other power

---------02:22----------
supplies like pp bus g3 hot PV 5vs5 PP

---------02:26----------
5e s 3 are not present before this one

---------02:29----------
is then how is it going to turn on when

---------02:31----------
you first plug in the charger well the

---------02:33----------
way this works is this will actually

---------02:35----------
take the power directly from the charger

---------02:37----------
so let me just try to show you that here

---------02:39----------
so over here you have the charger coming

---------02:42----------
through and it will take power from the

---------02:44----------
charge directly if P P bus g3 hot is not

---------02:46----------
present and it goes through this diode

---------02:48----------
over here so this is burning burning hot

---------02:51----------
so the first thing that I did is I

---------02:54----------
decided to look up where P P 3 V 4 to

---------02:56----------
underscore g3 hot was on the board

---------02:58----------
so let's look up where PP 3 V 4 to

---------03:00----------
underscore g3 Hadas on this board this

---------03:03----------
is this is scaling in Windows 8 gotta

---------03:06----------
love it then again I can't really blame

---------03:07----------
Windows 8 for the scaling and the soft

---------03:09----------
way because this software is garbage

---------03:10----------
trash that was made probably for Windows

---------03:12----------
3.1

---------03:13----------
when you look up blender X test link

---------03:15----------
you'll see that this software and has a

---------03:17----------
milestone on their website where they're

---------03:19----------
so excited that they created and that

---------03:21----------
milestone where they're so excited that

---------03:22----------
they created is from 1995 so what I'm

---------03:25----------
doing right now matters I'll move some

---------03:27----------
things around so they actually see how

---------03:29----------
I'm troubleshooting and also do that in

---------03:32----------
the camcorder so what I'm doing right

---------03:34----------
now is I'm gonna measure that little one

---------03:37----------
of those little spots that I see over

---------03:39----------
here on my multimeter so on the on the

---------03:45----------
screen over here it says that that's a

---------03:46----------
place where I can find pp 3 V 4 to

---------03:48----------
underscore g3 hot so I have a multimeter

---------03:50----------
diode mode I have the red pin of the

---------03:52----------
multimeter you know on ground and I take

---------03:54----------
the black probe and I put it right to

---------03:56----------
where pp 3 before it's you under square

---------03:58----------
G 3 hottests that's not a short to

---------04:00----------
ground at all so back to the drawing

---------04:01----------
board here now I'm going to go back to

---------04:04----------
my screen capture and go over to the

---------04:06----------
here so this is not shorted to ground

---------04:09----------
which means this chip is probably not

---------04:11----------
shorted to ground so let's get closer

---------04:12----------
over here our 6905 and our 6920 are

---------04:15----------
burned these got burned for a good

---------04:18----------
reason there's there was no corrosion

---------04:19----------
there there was no evidence of liquid

---------04:20----------
damage in that particular spot of the

---------04:22----------
board the liquid damage on this board

---------04:23----------
was in a totally different spot so that

---------04:25----------
means that something over here must have

---------04:26----------
been

---------04:27----------
being power through so much power

---------04:28----------
through that it actually managed to burn

---------04:30----------
this so let's check these capacitors

---------04:32----------
because these are also a path to ground

---------04:34----------
you have c6 992 c6 9 and 1 and c6 9 9 0

---------04:37----------
remember PP 3 V 4 2 undersquare g3 hot

---------04:40----------
is not shorted to ground so all the

---------04:41----------
things that go to ground then that bus

---------04:43----------
I'm not interested in because they

---------04:44----------
didn't show it to ground

---------04:45----------
let's try c6 9 9 to c6 9 9 1 and c6 9 9

---------04:49----------
0 these three are tied together so it's

---------04:51----------
gonna be a little bit difficult to find

---------04:53----------
out which one it is to c6 9 9 1 c6 9 9 0

---------04:59----------
ok now this is this component over here

---------05:03----------
so I'm going to try and check that

---------05:06----------
component

---------05:06----------
now we're gonna measure it and you'll

---------05:08----------
see what I see on my multimeter in a

---------05:10----------
second now I love this all switching

---------05:13----------
back and forth thing the editing is just

---------05:15----------
I don't have to edit anymore it is it's

---------05:18----------
gonna make doing these videos so much

---------05:20----------
easier so I'm gonna take my multimeter

---------05:21----------
right now and I'm gonna go over to that

---------05:23----------
capacitor now on this side I'm supposed

---------05:25----------
to see PP 3v I'm supposed to see the

---------05:28----------
incoming power from the charge and as

---------05:30----------
you can see there is a zero voltage drop

---------05:32----------
to ground meaning that the power there

---------05:33----------
is there's a perfect path to ground

---------05:35----------
through there which means one of those

---------05:37----------
three capacitors is probably destroyed

---------05:39----------
now what I'm gonna do here is replace

---------05:42----------
all three I am NOT a cheapskate i buy

---------05:44----------
these boards very very cheaply from ana

---------05:46----------
kind gentleman called david at advanced

---------05:49----------
three works so if you go to advanced

---------05:50----------
three works calm you can ask David to

---------05:54----------
sell you both donor boards where you can

---------05:56----------
get all these parts from and that is

---------05:58----------
what I recommend you do again it really

---------06:00----------
it makes no damn sense to be buying

---------06:03----------
these little things from Mouser and

---------06:04----------
waiting a week for two weeks to get them

---------06:06----------
because as I always say what if

---------06:08----------
something else is wrong with your board

---------06:09----------
what if this is not the problem what if

---------06:11----------
it's something else then you gotta wait

---------06:12----------
a week for other components to show up

---------06:14----------
then you have another problem you gotta

---------06:15----------
wait another week for another set of

---------06:17----------
components the shop and you wind up

---------06:18----------
wasting so much ridiculous time and

---------06:20----------
really what customers are gonna wind up

---------06:23----------
waiting for you to figure out

---------06:25----------
around with

---------06:26----------
along with their board as you order them

---------06:28----------
over and over and over again so I have

---------06:30----------
these donor boards here and I'm gonna

---------06:31----------
use them to replace see 6 9 9 0 C 6 9 +

---------06:35----------
1 + C 6 9 9 - now if we go over to the

---------06:38----------
microscope I'm pretty confident that

---------06:39----------
that component is going to look like

---------06:41----------
complete so let me just turn on

---------06:43----------
this fume extractor here because I don't

---------06:46----------
want to die of inhaling all of this

---------06:48----------
garbage and early death let's go over

---------06:55----------
here into the microscope and we're gonna

---------06:56----------
take a look at what these things look

---------06:57----------
like yeah you see that's and that's

---------07:03----------
nasty so

---------07:12----------
rest in peace new tweezers they actually

---------07:17----------
didn't land on the point for once

---------07:26----------
Steve here was kind enough to allow me

---------07:28----------
to take these new tweezers since I've

---------07:30----------
destroyed all of mine they're pretty

---------07:31----------
nice they have this cool grip on them I

---------07:33----------
like I'm just waiting for my heat this

---------07:40----------
to heat up

---------07:47----------
come on Echo eat up

---------08:00----------
more little abused hot air station I

---------08:02----------
really think it's about time I replaced

---------08:04----------
the heating element in this thing it

---------08:05----------
does not heat up like it used to all

---------08:07----------
right let's try to get it off a little

---------08:09----------
bit easier it's some place the cruddy

---------08:16----------
old lead-free solder with some leaded

---------08:19----------
yeah it's really as time I get a new

---------08:21----------
eating element for that thing that's one

---------08:24----------
of the things that one of millions of

---------08:26----------
things I just don't have time for okay I

---------08:28----------
plan I go I plan to go to the website

---------08:29----------
and then it snows what does this look

---------08:32----------
like Louis do you think you could fix

---------08:33----------
this in this much time though somebody's

---------08:35----------
calling about a camera install

---------08:46----------
okay now just for curious shits and

---------08:49----------
giggles let's see if I've removed my

---------08:51----------
short to ground here I didn't click it

---------08:56----------
just changed over on the screen I didn't

---------08:58----------
click from just from dropping the

---------09:01----------
keyboard on my messy desk it clicked

---------09:03----------
that's scary I am multimeter how day you

---------09:10----------
try to save battery still a short to

---------09:15----------
ground so let's see what the other

---------09:16----------
capacitors here are talking about so

---------09:18----------
we're gonna go over and find the other

---------09:20----------
ones yeah where is c6 9 9 0 and c6 9 9 1

---------09:26----------
up there since I'm turning the board I

---------09:29----------
have the unique opportunity to actually

---------09:31----------
put the board in the view that it isn't

---------09:32----------
in in the software so we're gonna look

---------09:35----------
at those two capacitors and see what we

---------09:36----------
have

---------09:39----------
yeah alright so that entire section

---------09:42----------
could use replacing that's gonna be the

---------09:44----------
chip that creates PP 3 V 4 it's you

---------09:46----------
underscore g3 hunt along with the

---------09:49----------
inductor that's me and those two

---------09:53----------
smoothing capacitors on input to the

---------09:57----------
chip that creates PP 3 V 4 2 so first

---------10:03----------
things first I would prefer to not

---------10:04----------
destroy and burn the keyboard connector

---------10:07----------
so in a previous video I showed complete

---------10:09----------
disregard for the battery indicator

---------10:11----------
connector because I know that I was

---------10:14----------
gonna be replacing it anyway because it

---------10:16----------
didn't work this is actually a perfectly

---------10:18----------
fine connector there is nothing wrong

---------10:20----------
with it and further it's also a

---------10:21----------
connector that's really really not fun

---------10:23----------
to replace it's actually very miserable

---------10:25----------
to replace that connector and since it's

---------10:27----------
miserable to replace it and I have no

---------10:28----------
reason to replace it I don't go on to

---------10:30----------
protect it with some captain tape so

---------10:32----------
that I don't destroy it

---------10:38----------
better be safe than sorry okay so we're

---------10:41----------
gonna remove those other two pieces

---------10:46----------
let's just remove all this entire

---------10:48----------
section all together let's though there

---------10:49----------
isn't that the whole point of buying

---------10:50----------
these donor boards and having five or

---------10:53----------
ten of them available yeah I know what

---------10:56----------
the problem is and she here's the other

---------10:58----------
problem check out the donor board that I

---------11:00----------
have here somebody got to it before I

---------11:05----------
did okay so before maybe I don't have as

---------11:08----------
much Liberty as I thought in replacing

---------11:10----------
every component let's see I have two

---------11:15----------
more here and tell me that those

---------11:17----------
stole everything okay so my other donor

---------11:21----------
board is here let's see what I have a

---------11:26----------
that's right okay so there was only that

---------11:29----------
one and think I know exactly who stole

---------11:34----------
all of that stuff and for once it was

---------11:37----------
not me

---------11:39----------
all right so I know that I have the

---------11:43----------
go-ahead the resources so that I can

---------11:46----------
just take all that junk out cuz really I

---------11:48----------
don't want to look at it it's all liquid

---------11:49----------
damage like one of those resistors may

---------11:51----------
be good but really they do I care no

---------11:55----------
it's time to get rid of this

---------11:56----------
goodbye goodbye bye

---------12:02----------
gtfo

---------12:19----------
rest in peace okay some of those pads

---------12:26----------
are yeah you see what I'm talking about

---------12:28----------
they don't look very nice

---------12:33----------
some of those pads are gone and done for

---------12:35----------
so there's probably going to be some

---------12:38----------
jumper ring work to be done here

---------12:47----------
we'll see just how much you know to what

---------12:49----------
extent in a second

---------13:01----------
first things first is my short gun

---------13:04----------
righty so let's take a look

---------13:10----------
multimeter diode mode black probe red

---------13:14----------
probe I don't screw around with these

---------13:16----------
probes because they will go in through

---------13:18----------
your hand one end and out the other so I

---------13:19----------
honestly don't care if I knock things

---------13:21----------
around my desk if it means that I'm not

---------13:23----------
letting these probes run around and get

---------13:25----------
me so red probe on groans black probe

---------13:28----------
right had the short before it says oh

---------13:36----------
well which means I'm good which means I

---------13:38----------
removed my short so let's now go back

---------13:41----------
and rebuild that section of the board so

---------13:44----------
that's the PP three before to underscore

---------13:46----------
eg three hot section that I would like

---------13:48----------
to rebuild here and let's put my

---------13:50----------
keyboard over here where I can't get in

---------13:52----------
my way

---------13:55----------
alright so first things first

---------14:01----------
yeah that doesn't look very good

---------14:07----------
see what I'm talking about here

---------14:29----------
well idea here is I want to scratch away

---------14:31----------
so I actually have something to solder

---------14:33----------
to

---------14:42----------
that's gonna be peepee Bush g3 hot input

---------14:45----------
or charger input dependence remember

---------14:48----------
that was that was where we are short to

---------14:49----------
ground was right over here and that's

---------14:51----------
grounds to the section that got messed

---------14:54----------
up we also want to see about that other

---------15:02----------
side

---------15:19----------
okay and we flick away all right so

---------15:21----------
we've got solder connected pretty much

---------15:23----------
everything so now we can start adding

---------15:26----------
components let's get some work going on

---------15:35----------
here

---------16:30----------
now these tweezers conduct heat a lot

---------16:32----------
worse than my other ones which is nice

---------16:33----------
my hands are not getting irritated I

---------16:37----------
could get used to this

---------16:53----------
we'll have to make that look better

---------16:54----------
later because that is disgraceful

---------17:42----------
can't help myself

---------18:09----------
okay

---------18:33----------
see when the solder is flux on it

---------18:36----------
surface tension moves everything in a

---------18:38----------
place if you just heat it up

---------18:41----------
it's nice thing to rely on if you're a

---------18:44----------
klutz with your hands like I am

---------18:48----------
nice try resistor you're not escaping

---------18:51----------
but you see you tried to make a run for

---------18:53----------
it

---------18:54----------
little mofo nice try

---------19:09----------
now that capacitor that was by the SMC

---------19:12----------
from before

---------19:25----------
Wow this port still has an SMC on it

---------19:27----------
that I'm stealing the capacitor from I'm

---------19:29----------
surprised

---------19:46----------
and also remember those two diodes not

---------19:52----------
the two diodes or two resistors

---------20:01----------
yeah I know all that stuff above it is

---------20:04----------
gonna blow away I've learned my lesson

---------20:07----------
like that little piece of right

---------20:10----------
over there

---------20:10----------
and the connector is going to get all

---------20:12----------
burned up now I know you're gonna try

---------20:28----------
captain tape is my friend

---------20:42----------
that's an ass nasty junk left over on

---------20:45----------
that pad let's get a little bit of it so

---------20:48----------
was how there was some little junk left

---------20:50----------
on it when I started working I was a

---------20:53----------
piece of wood whatever resistor I

---------20:56----------
removed

---------21:08----------
now the short is gone those two

---------21:10----------
resistors shouldn't burn again

---------21:46----------
hey OCD touch-ups are done now let's see

---------21:49----------
if I get a green light

---------21:51----------
no green light on the charger I'm afraid

---------21:54----------
so now I go back to measuring

---------22:27----------
pp 3v4 - is only 1.2 volts and goes back

---------22:32----------
and forth very quickly

---------22:39----------
said

---------22:43----------
charge revolted is present

---------23:00----------
nothing else is present

---------23:14----------
you got the birds a cage of in there

---------23:17----------
it's okay can I see the birds can I see

---------23:21----------
the birds why did Steve give you the

---------23:24----------
birds back why don't you want to take

---------23:28----------
care of them

---------23:32----------
can I see what it looks like you have a

---------23:34----------
picture

---------23:37----------
I want to see a picture destroying a

---------23:42----------
motherboard same as always

---------23:45----------
this is all gonna get edited because I'm

---------23:48----------
 this board to hell and back

---------23:49----------
anyway hopefully I don't include that if

---------23:54----------
I I include that I'll get in trouble

---------23:57----------
you're not bothering me at all veneer

---------23:59----------
this motherboard is bothering me but

---------24:02----------
you're not bothering me how could you

---------24:05----------
ever think you're bothering me

---------24:08----------
Hey look you can switch this what's cool

---------24:10----------
about this office you could switch back

---------24:11----------
and forth between this and the one I'm

---------24:14----------
 up in real time no more yeah I

---------24:17----------
don't have to edit like crazy anymore

---------24:19----------
just boom zing and you can switch and

---------24:21----------
see the screen and everything so if I

---------24:23----------
want to record the screen you can do

---------24:25----------
this and I can show the schematic I love

---------24:29----------
this software it's awesome awesome and

---------24:31----------
amazing

---------24:37----------
I'm destroying right now threatened her

---------24:40----------
mother point that's no good

---------24:43----------
I removed an inductor did I removed an

---------24:50----------
inductor so there's a three point four

---------24:52----------
volt power supply that was missing

---------24:54----------
that's where the spill was on the board

---------24:55----------
so there's a little piece that attaches

---------24:58----------
that to the rest of the computer so I

---------25:00----------
removed that little piece because I want

---------25:01----------
to see if there's something wrong in

---------25:03----------
front of it or if the thingy that makes

---------25:04----------
three point four volts is broken it

---------25:07----------
depends if they want to pay yeah so

---------25:10----------
let's see so is this three point four

---------25:11----------
crap see this is we're having an assist

---------25:14----------
coming so handy every other company gets

---------25:16----------
to have an assistant in their videos I

---------25:18----------
don't have an assistant because venire

---------25:20----------
is a shame that she works here she's it

---------25:24----------
so that's not good yikes

---------25:32----------
see that's supposed to be three

---------25:37----------
instead of being three it's 15 oh that's

---------25:43----------
Mme inductor it's a coil that power goes

---------25:46----------
through but see there's that's supposed

---------25:48----------
to be three volts and it's fifteen point

---------25:49----------
seven that's no good venir don't let

---------25:58----------
them know that they'll stop watching my

---------26:00----------
videos this is what makes it h mmm so

---------26:06----------
this was sure this is a capacitor that

---------26:08----------
goes to ground that this was shorted

---------26:09----------
these two were burned because this was

---------26:11----------
shorting the ground so replaced this and

---------26:13----------
now it's still not making what it's

---------26:15----------
supposed to this is what makes three

---------26:19----------
point four volts but it's not creating

---------26:21----------
it so I think our 699 this is the

---------26:24----------
feedback network that's supposed to tell

---------26:26----------
this what it's doing and I don't think

---------26:27----------
it is our six nine nine five or six nine

---------26:30----------
nine six let's see our 6 9 9 5 r 6 9 9 6

---------26:36----------
r r 6 9 9 5 r 6 9 9 6 did i attach these

---------26:58----------
okay I didn't attach them so see how one

---------27:01----------
two three one two I'm not that smart

---------27:09----------
okay let's see if I put that there what

---------27:13----------
happens do any of these have that left

---------27:16----------
there we go

---------27:17----------
there's one that has it if I put this on

---------27:23----------
I should get 3.3 volts now

---------27:30----------
don't bring your finger in here I don't

---------27:32----------
want you to hurt yourself here

---------27:44----------
and where'd I put my inductor here's the

---------27:46----------
inductor stuck on the desk this is a

---------27:50----------
keyboard backlight connector which I'm

---------27:51----------
probably going to burn

---------28:15----------
but you see what happened when you

---------28:17----------
walked in the room I've been

---------28:18----------
with this for the past half-hour and I

---------28:19----------
got nowhere that was you

---------28:23----------
you helped me Pinero without your help

---------28:30----------
yes and help me fix you just made me

---------28:33----------
$425

---------28:35----------
you made me $425 but here help me fix

---------28:42----------
okay so what happened here real quick is

---------28:45----------
my assistant came in with something

---------28:46----------
important to talk about and I had to fix

---------28:48----------
the board and work on things while she

---------28:51----------
was talking to me so me as I say you

---------28:54----------
know a lot of the times I want to do

---------28:55----------
these videos and I wind up getting

---------28:56----------
interrupted by real life so let me just

---------28:58----------
go over what it was that I was doing

---------29:00----------
when you couldn't see everything so what

---------29:02----------
happened is I soldered everything back

---------29:05----------
on here for a P P 3 V 4 2 and since I

---------29:09----------
was trying to do two things at once what

---------29:11----------
happened was I didn't solder the

---------29:13----------
feedback resistor over here so this was

---------29:15----------
only creating one volt and then going

---------29:17----------
back down to zero one ball 0-1 volt zero

---------29:19----------
and when I removed an inductor which is

---------29:21----------
the flat 15 I wasn't working so what

---------29:23----------
happened is I looked at it again and I

---------29:25----------
tried to figure out what you know what

---------29:27----------
could be causing this I figured maybe

---------29:28----------
was feedback so I looked on the

---------29:30----------
schematic and I saw that the feedback

---------29:32----------
resistor was not on there so let me just

---------29:36----------
show you that on the schematic I just

---------29:39----------
put the screen and capture back on

---------29:42----------
so yeah I'm not always gonna get to do

---------29:45----------
the videos as complete as I like and

---------29:47----------
that is something I'm gonna have to live

---------29:49----------
with but it's better I figure it's

---------29:51----------
better than putting up no content at all

---------29:52----------
you know like in a lot of places that do

---------29:54----------
this kind of thing they don't put up any

---------29:55----------
content at all because they they just

---------29:57----------
don't want it getting in the way of

---------29:58----------
their everyday life so anyway so this

---------30:01----------
resistant over here so you can see this

---------30:02----------
is the chip that creates PP 3 V 4 - this

---------30:05----------
is where it outputs now here you have R

---------30:07----------
6 9 + 5 + r 6 9 9 6 which goes to PP 3 v

---------30:10----------
4 to underscore g 3 a trying to score FB

---------30:12----------
which is for feedback if you don't know

---------30:14----------
what that pin means you can always look

---------30:16----------
up the name of this you can google the

---------30:17----------
chip LT 3 4 7 0 AED you can get a

---------30:20----------
datasheet for that chip and that will

---------30:22----------
tell you so what I did is I looked on

---------30:24----------
the board view and I noticed I had C 6 9

---------30:26----------
5 r 6 9 9 5 but I did not have our 6 9 9

---------30:28----------
6 3

---------30:29----------
therefore the feedback network was not

---------30:31----------
fully functional so now what we're going

---------30:36----------
to do is plug it in and see if this

---------30:38----------
turns on do keep in mind that before

---------30:40----------
this board had absolutely no power parts

---------30:43----------
of it would get boiling hot when you

---------30:45----------
touch them and there was no green light

---------30:47----------
on the charger there was no voltage

---------30:49----------
going to the board now after doing

---------30:51----------
everything

---------30:59----------
the fan spins which as I like to joke

---------31:04----------
means we're done

---------31:06----------
yeah let's plug it into the machine for

---------31:09----------
shits and giggles see that everything

---------31:11----------
done here actually works I can't get one

---------31:15----------
of those keyboard things that goes under

---------31:16----------
the desk because of the metal bar on

---------31:17----------
this IKEA desk it's killing me that got

---------31:19----------
spoiled too having that in the other

---------31:21----------
office that I opened a month ago so what

---------31:26----------
I'm gonna look for here is that we just

---------31:27----------
have made some basics you know the

---------31:30----------
screen comes on CPU v core and I'll run

---------31:34----------
a SD on this later I don't really feel

---------31:37----------
like running a SD on stuff on camera

---------31:38----------
because it's kind of boring so what I do

---------31:41----------
is I upload these videos if the board

---------31:43----------
wound up fully working if the board did

---------31:45----------
not wind up working I don't upload it

---------31:47----------
because I am strongly against half-assed

---------31:50----------
videos where I'm showing you how to do

---------31:52----------
things that don't work now don't get me

---------31:54----------
wrong I don't mind uploading a video

---------31:55----------
where I show you that something doesn't

---------31:56----------
work and I show you why but I'm really

---------31:58----------
not for making it look like something

---------32:01----------
worked when it actually did not so well

---------32:04----------
I don't put all the testing on camera

---------32:06----------
if this thing winds up not working you

---------32:09----------
can bet your ass that this video is

---------32:11----------
going to go in the recycling bin until

---------32:16----------
unless I feel like going back and

---------32:18----------
troubleshooting why it doesn't work in

---------32:19----------
which case you know it'll just get

---------32:21----------
edited accordingly

---------32:58----------
so we made some progress you got to see

---------33:01----------
my troubleshooting process you got to

---------33:03----------
see you make a couple of mistakes along

---------33:06----------
the way and hopefully you learn

---------33:07----------
something
