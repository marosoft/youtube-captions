---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so let's

---------00:01----------
get started working on getting another

---------00:02----------
MacBook it doesn't work properly here we

---------00:04----------
have an 8 1502 in a 2-0 - 49 24 board

---------00:06----------
that's not functioning and well today

---------00:09----------
what we're gonna do is we're gonna try

---------00:10----------
to figure out why it's not functioning

---------00:12----------
looks like everything's already been

---------00:14----------
unplugged from this MacBook we are going

---------00:16----------
to turn on the power supply plug this

---------00:20----------
thing in see how much power it takes and

---------00:21----------
see if it turns on all right it says

---------00:25----------
it's taking zero I am switch is clearly

---------00:27----------
[ __ ] no way that's possible I'm just

---------00:34----------
gonna see if my power supply and charger

---------00:36----------
are not working properly by plugging in

---------00:38----------
the board I just fixed the board that I

---------00:40----------
just fixed is taking 500 milliamps with

---------00:44----------
a fan spin so my charger is working that

---------00:46----------
is really strange I've never had a zero

---------00:48----------
amps before like zero point zero zero

---------00:50----------
zero that is so strange that is really

---------00:54----------
really weird okay let's take the board

---------00:55----------
out of the case and see what's going on

---------00:57----------
with this strange MacBook what are your

---------00:59----------
feelings regarding the death of Naya

---------01:00----------
Rivera I don't know who that is

---------01:03----------
I have no I don't really follow much in

---------01:08----------
terms of I know pop culture and [ __ ]

---------01:10----------
like that

---------01:10----------
assuming this is pop culture let's see

---------01:12----------
no I googled Naya Rivera is an American

---------01:16----------
actress model and singer yeah I mean

---------01:17----------
again I don't I don't really follow like

---------01:20----------
actresses and models and all that stuff

---------01:22----------
so I don't yeah I don't really have a

---------01:26----------
thought cuz I don't really know who that

---------01:28----------
is

---------01:35----------
if someone died I think that's terrible

---------01:38----------
you know I'm sorry the air if a good

---------01:41----------
person died that sucks but I don't

---------01:48----------
really follow their lives or anything

---------01:50----------
like that so it's kind of like the same

---------01:51----------
thing as if you said you know some

---------01:54----------
random person on the street today died

---------01:56----------
I'd say you know that I'm sad sorry it

---------01:58----------
happened but you know is what it is

---------02:01----------
people people come people go no one gets

---------02:05----------
out of this alive

---------02:09----------
alright let's dig into this Macke

---------02:12----------
so we have an interesting case here

---------02:14----------
because there is corrosion over here

---------02:16----------
this is gonna be where the power for CPU

---------02:21----------
is the core is created part of that and

---------02:24----------
we have here for the clock chip however

---------02:26----------
neither of this has anything to do with

---------02:27----------
the fact that when I plug it in the

---------02:28----------
charge isn't giving anything like

---------02:30----------
nothing gives zero gives zilch so we

---------02:33----------
have multiple things that we have to fix

---------02:35----------
here it's gonna be multiple multivariate

---------02:39----------
problem so if we take a look at

---------02:41----------
something let's say PP 3 or 4 - a via

---------02:44----------
Slee that's not present because you have

---------02:45----------
nothing present take a look at the

---------02:48----------
what's on the input yeah like you're

---------02:51----------
getting one volt to the input of PP 3

---------02:54----------
for 2 so one volt is coming through the

---------02:56----------
entire system so this is gonna be

---------02:58----------
annoying died while out in the lake with

---------03:01----------
her son they found him floating alone on

---------03:03----------
the boat ok that's a little strange

---------03:05----------
you know I that sounds that that's

---------03:09----------
strange I got to say that that's weird

---------03:11----------
you know it's a little little little

---------03:13----------
weird little suspicious but again what

---------03:14----------
do I know any parent that's gonna be by

---------03:18----------
themselves in a lake on a boat with a

---------03:21----------
toddler is tragic no brain led to her

---------03:23----------
death and her son being with her mom

---------03:25----------
that's a little harsh I mean it I've

---------03:27----------
never gone on a I don't hmm I've been on

---------03:30----------
the Staten Island Ferry but other than

---------03:33----------
that I don't really think I've been on a

---------03:34----------
boat before that I remember like how

---------03:37----------
dangerous is being on a boat you know if

---------03:40----------
you're on if you're in a lake on a boat

---------03:41----------
is that real like do you have to worry

---------03:43----------
about sharks do you have to worry about

---------03:45----------
aliens coming do you have to worry about

---------03:49----------
I don't see it again I'm not someone who

---------03:51----------
travels and lakes very much I don't

---------03:52----------
really know much about the dangers

---------03:54----------
because it's not something I do but is

---------03:57----------
it really that dangerous to be on a lake

---------03:59----------
with a boat like is do you have do you

---------04:04----------
have sharks do you have you know do you

---------04:09----------
have the killer whales I don't

---------04:12----------
understand it you know I don't get it

---------04:15----------
maybe I mean I can swim so you know I

---------04:18----------
like lakes are also not like the ocean

---------04:20----------
where you have these gigantic waves and

---------04:21----------
all that I really don't get it

---------04:23----------
I don't understand I'm sorry like again

---------04:26----------
if I if as someone I don't have any

---------04:28----------
experience going out on lakes you know

---------04:31----------
I've seen lakes I've seen people in

---------04:32----------
boats on lakes and it looks like the

---------04:35----------
most inconsequential [ __ ] in the world I

---------04:36----------
can't even if you wind up getting tossed

---------04:38----------
off your boat somehow you slip I can't

---------04:41----------
imagine why you just can't swim or you

---------04:43----------
know do something I I don't

---------04:48----------
again yeah I really don't get it sorry

---------04:50----------
you know like it's sad and it is kind of

---------04:54----------
suspicious because due to the how

---------04:56----------
seemingly not dangerous being on a lake

---------04:59----------
is it just this kind of make me wonder

---------05:01----------
what happened to anyone let's get back

---------05:04----------
to actually fixing [ __ ] I like

---------05:09----------
theorizing what happened to a celebrity

---------05:10----------
it's like this is the kind I just can't

---------05:15----------
can't do it alright so

---------05:41----------
I have met

---------05:56----------
the resistors themselves look fine the

---------05:59----------
main thing I'm gonna replace is the chip

---------06:00----------
because the chip could have been you

---------06:03----------
know short something could have popped

---------06:05----------
Earl and poof or whatever when liquid

---------06:09----------
hit it a resistor is a simple thing

---------06:12----------
another resistor it doesn't but this

---------06:16----------
chip is a complex thing and it's

---------06:17----------
responsible for sending power to my CPU

---------06:33----------
hello meraxes how are you doing today

---------07:15----------
Paul Daniels is mr. Paul Daniels here

---------07:23----------
Majan this is time for him to get some

---------07:25----------
sleep

---------07:46----------
and that's a nasty resistor we got to go

---------08:21----------
all Daniel

---------09:40----------
mr. D voted for mr.

---------10:59----------
come on

---------11:09----------
there we go

---------11:12----------
really wish she fixed Lenovo's also says

---------11:14----------
Miguel fing pads are designed with

---------11:18----------
liquid resistance I would go bankrupt

---------11:21----------
offering liquid damage appear on us I

---------11:25----------
also tried to become a Lenovo authorized

---------11:27----------
repair center back in 2014 I did a video

---------11:30----------
on that it's called how the authorized

---------11:31----------
repair center is forced to screw the

---------11:33----------
consumer the null video these tweezers

---------11:38----------
I'm not feeling these tweezers compared

---------11:39----------
to my old ones I'm holding the chips

---------11:42----------
above the board that's why they're never

---------11:43----------
actually getting a proper solder job

---------11:48----------
onto the board like that's gonna flow on

---------11:51----------
a place once I heat the area above it to

---------11:54----------
get that cap in the sister there

---------12:07----------
there we go

---------13:09----------
los zapatos yes Rojo los zapatos so on

---------13:14----------
Azul okay I shouldn't say only the

---------13:18----------
vowels I remember a little bit more

---------13:19----------
Spanish than that yeah I can't speak

---------13:27----------
Spanish or [ __ ]

---------13:39----------
I remember when I was a kid as I get

---------13:41----------
home I'm supposed to study for my

---------13:43----------
Spanish class and it's a study for

---------13:45----------
Spanish class read debates in this last

---------13:48----------
comment section study for Spanish class

---------13:50----------
read debates in this last comment

---------13:52----------
section I would read / comment section

---------13:59----------
probably would have a lot better grades

---------14:01----------
if I spent less time reading the slash

---------14:03----------
comment section but that's not the way

---------14:06----------
it worked out okay so the next now we

---------14:09----------
fix the stuff that was corroded it we

---------14:11----------
would have had to fix anyway the problem

---------14:13----------
is that we haven't fixed the primary

---------14:14----------
issue which is nothing coming in on dcn

---------14:18----------
we still have nothing on dcn so let's

---------14:21----------
analyze that first rail we need is TP 3

---------14:24----------
4 2 so let's check that board schematics

---------14:26----------
alright

---------14:27----------
so 18 volts is supposed to come in

---------14:29----------
around here let's just check fuse 7 0 0

---------14:31----------
5 ok we have 17 volts there

---------14:39----------
and if I look over here

---------14:46----------
okay that was measuring nothing before

---------14:48----------
and now we have PP 3 4 2 so pp 3 4 2

---------14:51----------
decided to magically reappear why is

---------14:53----------
beyond me don't really get it but now

---------14:56----------
we're stuck at 30 milliamps which is

---------14:57----------
typically p.m. sleep s4l missing now my

---------15:01----------
guess is that the cpu died because there

---------15:04----------
was because that that ship was in

---------15:07----------
horrible horrible corrosion

---------15:11----------
now the SMC is also corroded as well so

---------15:14----------
we're gonna have to give the SMC a bit

---------15:15----------
of a heating and a refluxing and re

---------15:18----------
flowing and a refluxing and a rebo e 3

---------15:21----------
Boeing 3 Boeing a verb

---------15:32----------
so you reinvest taxpayer dollars into a

---------15:34----------
publicly traded corporation rebelling

---------15:49----------
your society is [ __ ] you your society

---------15:54----------
is [ __ ] you trolling you

---------16:25----------
died

---------16:32----------
you want to get rid of all this junk

---------16:34----------
that's under these SMC

---------17:36----------
my flux kind of looks purple you can't

---------17:39----------
tell in the camera but for some reason

---------17:40----------
it looks purple on my screen that's

---------17:42----------
weird that's weird

---------19:16----------
No

---------20:22----------
okay we have 500 milliamps and shortly

---------20:25----------
we were gonna have fans been as you can

---------20:30----------
see by the bing bada boom fan spin so it

---------20:34----------
looks like we had corrosion along the

---------20:37----------
CPU v core chip luckily to see if you

---------20:39----------
didn't get 12 volts for this turning on

---------20:40----------
and working clock chip which would have

---------20:43----------
been responsible for PPV RTC which is

---------20:46----------
required for the PCH which is located in

---------20:48----------
the CPU in this to turn on and do all

---------20:50----------
the things it does and the SMC was

---------20:53----------
corroded SMC stands for system

---------20:54----------
management controller no management no

---------20:56----------
worky that's about it the ultrasonic

---------20:59----------
this board give it a little bit of a

---------21:00----------
cleaning and it's good to go so you know

---------21:03----------
I'm just same old [ __ ] probably not

---------21:05----------
really entertaining anymore it's kind of

---------21:07----------
getting boring for most to you I imagine

---------21:08----------
because it's been six and a half years

---------21:10----------
of the same [ __ ] content every

---------21:13----------
[ __ ] day which is probably why the

---------21:14----------
board repair videos I do get virtually

---------21:15----------
no views and contrast to any other type

---------21:17----------
of content I do it not limited but not

---------21:20----------
including to me petting my kitty that's

---------21:22----------
about it see you on the next video
