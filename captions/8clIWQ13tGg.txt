---------01:46----------
nice letter Batman Beyond out seeker

---------01:48----------
remembers it that was Derek powers in

---------01:52----------
episode 13 season 1 played by Sherman

---------01:55----------
Howard one of my favorite voice actors

---------01:58----------
outside of Michael Ironside in any of

---------02:02----------
these cartoons ok so this is your

---------02:04----------
standard piece of [ __ ] eight two zero

---------02:06----------
three three three two board with the u

---------02:08----------
8900 ship issue where and the issue with

---------02:11----------
this one need to see our 3332 is it the

---------02:13----------
is a buck converter problem let's see if

---------02:17----------
that's the case here or if it's actually

---------02:19----------
dead most likely this is powering on the

---------02:21----------
customer thinks it's not powering on

---------02:22----------
because they see nothing on the screen

---------02:23----------
all right so it's taking an amp which

---------02:25----------
means this thing is turning on this is a

---------02:27----------
boring-ass you 8900 issue actually yeah

---------02:31----------
this thing turns on already so there's

---------02:34----------
really not much to it this just needs a

---------02:41----------
you eighty nine hundred and it'll work

---------02:45----------
we all get approval for that and go on

---------02:51----------
600 no amps it should be booting this

---------02:54----------
screw is stripped so I'm gonna try to

---------02:57----------
put a t6 screwdriver into the t5 hole

---------02:59----------
and see if that lets me remove it okay

---------03:04----------
that screw is so stripped that nothing's

---------03:05----------
gonna remove it so you want to see a

---------03:07----------
trick I'll show you a trick exa light

---------03:10----------
175 M fine tip snippers it allows you to

---------03:14----------
grab under the screw like so and then

---------03:18----------
you twist and then once you've given it

---------03:20----------
a little twist even if it's still

---------03:21----------
stripped you should be able to grab it I

---------03:23----------
left a little love bite in the SSD but

---------03:26----------
there's no traces on the ends of this

---------03:28----------
SSD so I'm good I don't really gotta

---------03:31----------
care there's a little love bite on the

---------03:33----------
surface of it that's fine I gave the SSD

---------03:35----------
a bit of a hickey oh they stripped this

---------03:38----------
is evil

---------03:39----------
you know that's evil they stripped the

---------03:41----------
screws and I can't get to with the exa

---------03:43----------
light flush cutters oh come on that's

---------03:46----------
[ __ ] up

---------03:46----------
look how am I supposed to fit a flush

---------03:49----------
cutter in there that's evil strip the

---------03:54----------
other screws not this one you should cut

---------03:58----------
your heatsink if any computer deserves

---------04:03----------
them slightly strong heatsink it's this

---------04:05----------
one Kewpie such son-of-a-bitch

---------04:16----------
okay so this is you 8900 this is what

---------04:19----------
commonly causes us to have no image or

---------04:21----------
intermittent image because of shits

---------04:24----------
outer joins I'm just gonna clean off all

---------04:25----------
the dirt before we get started now when

---------04:28----------
I see shits outer joins let's just take

---------04:29----------
a look so you can get an idea what it is

---------04:31----------
I'm talking about here that's brittle

---------04:33----------
that is some brittle brittle solder

---------04:35----------
joints yeah you see how brittle this is

---------04:37----------
see that that's Apple soldering right

---------04:40----------
there so this chip is responsible for

---------04:42----------
controlling the transistors that make up

---------04:47----------
the buck converter from the main power

---------04:49----------
rail if you brush teeth free hot to the

---------04:51----------
GPU and if you look at that fourth pin

---------04:55----------
from the left like the fourth pin from

---------04:57----------
the left that is just pure there's no

---------05:00----------
other way to put it that's just dog [ __ ]

---------05:01----------
like let's just zoom all the way because

---------05:04----------
we can yeah I'm gonna keep the polarizer

---------05:09----------
I may end up going for an LED fiber

---------05:11----------
light thing but I'm definitely gonna

---------05:13----------
keep the polarizer oh my god I mean

---------05:19----------
that's just [ __ ] there's no other way to

---------05:21----------
put it that is that is trash

---------05:22----------
that is absolute utter gutter rubber

---------05:26----------
rudder [ __ ] binding again it's trash

---------05:31----------
it's just garbage so what are we gonna

---------05:34----------
do oh that's a great question you're

---------05:37----------
gonna turn on my fume extractor turn on

---------05:40----------
my solo during iron I like to use a t30

---------05:43----------
- KN tip with a hako 2032 you can see

---------05:47----------
that I keep mine in immaculate condition

---------05:49----------
tape everywhere this is the FM 2032

---------05:52----------
soldering iron and I should have a link

---------05:55----------
in the description below and a t30 - k

---------05:59----------
and tip see it's shaped like a chisel a

---------06:06----------
little knife there at the end I like

---------06:08----------
that shape it makes it easier to do qfn

---------06:11----------
retouching like this so what I do is I'm

---------06:15----------
gonna take some Amtech flux that should

---------06:18----------
never be out of stock in your store and

---------06:19----------
if it ever is god help your shipping

---------06:23----------
person

---------06:28----------
we're gonna put a basic amount of flux

---------06:30----------
over here like so we're gonna take some

---------06:36----------
solder

---------06:44----------
and we're gonna get to work

---------06:50----------
so watch what they look like now once

---------06:52----------
this is done

---------07:16----------
[Music]

---------07:19----------
so I'm just gonna raise the temperature

---------07:21----------
here on this iron for some reason it set

---------07:23----------
to 750 that's not gonna do I'm gonna

---------07:26----------
raise it to 840 you can see the solder

---------07:28----------
is not dragging the way I'd like yeah

---------07:35----------
now when there's a lot of flux it can be

---------07:37----------
really hard to see things so I'm gonna

---------07:38----------
turn on HDR thank you very much to the

---------07:40----------
person who pointed out that my camera

---------07:42----------
actually has HDR I'm usually using OBS

---------07:45----------
in a shrunk window so that I can read

---------07:47----------
chat while streaming so I didn't even so

---------07:50----------
I can't really read what most of that

---------07:51----------
stuff says let's see what happens a face

---------07:54----------
like turn that all the way up right now

---------07:56----------
so for these moments

---------07:58----------
[Applause]

---------08:19----------
I charge some $180 what was in an SMC

---------08:22----------
reset at the diagnose in the machine why

---------08:24----------
a bad person

---------08:25----------
female SMC reset ship or SMC reset like

---------08:29----------
holding the button down

---------08:35----------
I don't know the way I see it is this

---------08:37----------
like if it was if you knew that that

---------08:39----------
happened to your grandma how would you

---------08:41----------
feel about it you know

---------08:42----------
so our business model here is like we

---------08:44----------
never charge for [ __ ] like that but for

---------08:46----------
the thing the services that we do offer

---------08:48----------
we make money on like for the stuff that

---------08:51----------
we do do for the data recoveries for the

---------08:54----------
buffer for the clicking hard drives for

---------08:59----------
the board repairs like we charge our fee

---------09:01----------
but for the easy stuff or the simple

---------09:03----------
stuff like that like if I'm hitting just

---------09:07----------
pressing a button that's in plain view I

---------09:09----------
don't I don't build people for that and

---------09:13----------
I've gotten a lot of crap for that I've

---------09:15----------
gotten to like a lot over the years like

---------09:16----------
you know aren't you in business to make

---------09:18----------
money why are you doing things for free

---------09:20----------
you're devaluing your craft and like not

---------09:22----------
really yeah it really comes down to what

---------09:25----------
they how they feel when they fight

---------09:27----------
figure it out but not even so much that

---------09:29----------
it's about wanting to retain that person

---------09:34----------
long term so I would say I don't think

---------09:37----------
you're even necessarily a bad person

---------09:39----------
morally I just think that if you doing

---------09:42----------
that it's gonna be more difficult to

---------09:43----------
retain business long term so if you tell

---------09:46----------
them that that was the only issue and

---------09:48----------
you to say just leave a tip do you have

---------09:50----------
someone who trusts you for life and

---------09:52----------
who's gonna tell every single person

---------09:54----------
they know to only go to you nobody but

---------09:56----------
you for the rest of their life and

---------09:57----------
that's a good thing that's a good thing

---------10:00----------
and you kind of want to [ __ ] that up so

---------10:05----------
be careful there it's not even that I'm

---------10:08----------
a good guy don't get it twisted madmaz

---------10:10----------
it's just

---------10:13----------
it's hell up with I thought you weren't

---------10:15----------
gonna come today I I'm the boss I mean I

---------10:18----------
can change my mind and make it up as I

---------10:20----------
please

---------10:21----------
is your bike there no also the the xt9

---------10:25----------
t-connector broke off of my wiring so I

---------10:29----------
want had to come here to resolder it

---------10:31----------
anyway so I figured I might as well do

---------10:32----------
extreme and I agree wired a bit of my

---------10:35----------
bike so it looks better anyway like I

---------10:38----------
don't know I don't know if there's such

---------10:41----------
thing as true altruism I just think that

---------10:42----------
there are people that want to make money

---------10:44----------
and they want to you know they want to

---------10:46----------
make money there's just a different way

---------10:47----------
to go about trying to make the money cuz

---------10:51----------
I'm as greedy as anybody else it's just

---------10:52----------
I try to go about it in a manner where I

---------10:54----------
can sleep at night

---------10:56----------
James knowing how to fix the problem is

---------10:58----------
valuable but you have to bounce out with

---------10:59----------
your reputation what's worth more

---------11:01----------
yeah ghin it for me it's not even about

---------11:03----------
the not making money thing it's not

---------11:06----------
about like devaluing the craft or saying

---------11:08----------
you know making money is wrong for me if

---------11:10----------
I tell that person I just had to press a

---------11:14----------
button and now it works and I give it

---------11:17----------
back to them and they go the other place

---------11:18----------
one or two hundred dollars to fix this

---------11:20----------
I now have their trust for life and that

---------11:23----------
person is gonna it's kind of like the

---------11:25----------
way coronavirus spreads like you know

---------11:27----------
you're gonna talk to someone you get

---------11:29----------
them sick

---------11:30----------
you talk to three people you get those

---------11:31----------
three people sick those three people

---------11:33----------
that you know hang out with another ten

---------11:35----------
people they get those people sick then

---------11:37----------
those ten people get another ten people

---------11:38----------
sick and so on and so on but it's the

---------11:40----------
opposite it's it's it spreads in a good

---------11:42----------
way so it uses the same transmission

---------11:44----------
vector as coronavirus but you're

---------11:46----------
spreading positivity rather than

---------11:47----------
coughing and misery and occasionally

---------11:49----------
death the idea is to get people to want

---------11:54----------
to do business with you because of that

---------11:55----------
because there were a lot of people that

---------11:56----------
said that when I did that CBC news piece

---------11:59----------
Lewis would have never given that away

---------12:01----------
for free or he's an idiot if he did that

---------12:02----------
or bla bla bla not really

---------12:05----------
nine out of ten people are gonna say

---------12:07----------
just replace the display cable I don't

---------12:08----------
want that bent back piece of [ __ ] in my

---------12:11----------
$3,000 computer and they pay the 75 to

---------12:13----------
150 to replace it the one out of ten

---------12:15----------
that can't pay to do that they will

---------12:18----------
remember that I could have [ __ ] them

---------12:20----------
over I had them and the thing is like

---------12:22----------
how how you deal with people when you

---------12:24----------
have an option to [ __ ] them over but you

---------12:26----------
how you deal with people when you could

---------12:28----------
be technically a hundred percent in the

---------12:29----------
right to just take them take to take

---------12:32----------
their money over over something is

---------12:33----------
really basic I think that defines

---------12:35----------
character to some extent you know there

---------12:37----------
is a like there's a lot of stuff that we

---------12:39----------
do here they don't get don't get it

---------12:41----------
twisted if I'm worried people will say

---------12:43----------
that you know that cable is five dollars

---------12:44----------
and you charge one hundred to replace at

---------12:46----------
blah blah blah yeah for the things that

---------12:48----------
I do I do make money off of it but at

---------12:51----------
the same time it just comes down like if

---------12:52----------
I had to smc recently if I had to do

---------12:55----------
what's written in the manual that came

---------12:57----------
with the product if I had a hold down

---------12:59----------
the power button to get the machine to

---------13:01----------
turn on I know how would I feel if I was

---------13:04----------
on the other end of that transaction and

---------13:06----------
again it's not even about that one

---------13:08----------
eighty cuz I will if I give that away

---------13:11----------
and I explain what was wrong with it and

---------13:12----------
then I just say just leave a tip and

---------13:14----------
then they leave without paying anything

---------13:15----------
I in that moment you think I made no

---------13:18----------
money but I actually made ten thousand

---------13:20----------
dollars because the amount of publicity

---------13:22----------
that I'm going to get from that one

---------13:24----------
individual that's ten thousand dollars

---------13:25----------
right there it's not now I don't get to

---------13:27----------
see it now I may not see it in the next

---------13:29----------
two months but three or six years from

---------13:31----------
now I'll see it and then everybody else

---------13:33----------
is gonna just say he was just lucky he's

---------13:36----------
lucky that [ __ ] I put in all this work

---------13:39----------
but Luis is lucky that's why he got that

---------13:42----------
it's cause he made those videos I

---------13:44----------
installed Linux Mint on an acquaintance

---------13:46----------
laptop the winter random update she paid

---------13:47----------
me forty dollars so has half of thank ya

---------13:51----------
there there are a lot of people that

---------13:53----------
will say that you know Luis was just

---------13:54----------
lucky that's the reason that he got here

---------13:56----------
and the same people that I've heard say

---------13:58----------
that that I know or that I or that I

---------14:01----------
know the employees of because I know the

---------14:04----------
people that work at their firms they

---------14:06----------
were billing people $150 for a charge

---------14:09----------
port and then giving them a free charger

---------14:11----------
just to be nice when in reality the only

---------14:13----------
problem they had is a bad charger and

---------14:14----------
that business was spending twelve

---------14:16----------
thousand dollars a month on AdWords at a

---------14:18----------
time that I was spending zero dollars a

---------14:20----------
month on AdWords six years later I have

---------14:23----------
more business than they do and I spent a

---------14:25----------
lot less money in advertising

---------14:26----------
why because this is a better form of

---------14:28----------
advertising now you just so happen to be

---------14:30----------
doing something nice while you're doing

---------14:31----------
it is that really altruistic is it

---------14:34----------
altruistic if you're actually trying to

---------14:35----------
do something else I don't know but what

---------14:37----------
I know is that the customer doesn't

---------14:38----------
really care

---------14:39----------
don't care from being altruistic or just

---------14:42----------
trying to kill two birds with one stone

---------14:43----------
make more money in the long term and

---------14:46----------
make them happy without you know bending

---------14:50----------
them over the coals for holding down the

---------14:51----------
power button in the short term and

---------14:53----------
that's the way I see I will charge 300

---------14:55----------
or 400 for border pairs that I find

---------14:58----------
simple because there's no reasonable

---------15:00----------
expectation that the average person is

---------15:02----------
going to do that [ __ ] or do all the

---------15:03----------
research to learn how to do that on

---------15:04----------
their own and there are a lot of things

---------15:06----------
that we charge for because there's a lot

---------15:09----------
of repairs that we do where you'd like

---------15:11----------
with logic board repair well I could

---------15:12----------
spend four hours on one [ __ ] board

---------15:14----------
and get nowhere and if I don't get

---------15:15----------
anywhere I don't charge so on the on the

---------15:17----------
boarder pairs that do work you have to

---------15:18----------
charge to make up for it but my

---------15:21----------
marketing strategy is such that I try to

---------15:25----------
avoid billing people for this super easy

---------15:29----------
[ __ ] you know like removing lens from a

---------15:32----------
charge port kind of thing or my favorite

---------15:34----------
is the iPhone repair shops that a

---------15:36----------
customer would come in this is what

---------15:38----------
makes this so [ __ ] despicable to me

---------15:39----------
so this is something that either used to

---------15:41----------
drive me nuts with the iPhone 4 and 4s I

---------15:44----------
know I know I'm old I get it but you

---------15:46----------
know you you can you don't have to have

---------15:49----------
a cane to have been around on the iPhone

---------15:51----------
4 and 4s repair days there would be a

---------15:53----------
little piece of foam over the screen

---------15:58----------
connector over the screen plug so this

---------16:00----------
is the this is the port on the phone

---------16:02----------
this is the plug on the screen and then

---------16:04----------
there's a metal plate that goes over it

---------16:06----------
now if you don't have a piece of foam on

---------16:07----------
that the metal plate is here the plug is

---------16:09----------
here so if they dropped it then it just

---------16:10----------
some plugs if you don't put a little

---------16:12----------
piece of foam there it could be anything

---------16:14----------
you could put a piece of of belly button

---------16:16----------
lint in there it doesn't matter

---------16:17----------
something this slam it shot

---------16:18----------
the moment they [ __ ] lay that thing

---------16:20----------
down on a desk especially since the

---------16:21----------
cable is bending over like this it looks

---------16:24----------
like your arm it's kind of bending over

---------16:25----------
it's gonna pop up and there are places

---------16:28----------
that when the customer came back with

---------16:30----------
the screen they would say oh yeah it's

---------16:34----------
only 10 or 20 bucks it was an easy thing

---------16:36----------
what makes me [ __ ] sick

---------16:38----------
disgusted is that the customer would

---------16:40----------
then say thank you so much it was only

---------16:42----------
20 bucks thank you when in reality the

---------16:45----------
entire reason they're to come back there

---------16:46----------
is because you're a stupid [ __ ] that

---------16:48----------
didn't put the piece of foam in the

---------16:50----------
[ __ ] screen connector

---------16:54----------
but I'm not so let's see if we get an

---------16:56----------
image on this but before we do that

---------16:57----------
where this is you see how this was long

---------16:59----------
screwed off here I got to reattach this

---------17:01----------
this screw hole because that's that's

---------17:03----------
kind of nasty it's not even really

---------17:05----------
integrity because like people will give

---------17:07----------
me credit for being altruistic and it

---------17:09----------
really is not altruism it's the desire

---------17:11----------
to make money I will make more money if

---------17:14----------
I don't charge you for the basic thing

---------17:16----------
then I will make if I charge you for the

---------17:17----------
basic thing that is a shitty battery

---------17:19----------
plug from a shitty aftermarket battery

---------17:21----------
let's boot up and see if it boots into a

---------17:23----------
different operating system and you boot

---------17:31----------
so their operating system likely just

---------17:33----------
needs a little bit of fixing maybe a

---------17:36----------
reinstall and that's that it boots up

---------17:39----------
into an operating system and it works

---------17:41----------
so with this MacBook what we needed to

---------17:44----------
do was a little bit of chopping on the

---------17:48----------
screen cable and they wound up replacing

---------17:49----------
that and redoing you 8900 because the

---------17:52----------
solder joins on this you 8900 were

---------17:54----------
absolutely awful it is typical on the

---------17:57----------
2012 a 1398 15-inch MacBook Pro retina

---------18:01----------
with board model 8 - 0 - 3 3 3 - that's

---------18:07----------
it for today and as always I hope you

---------18:09----------
learned something I'll see you all in

---------18:12----------
the next video bye now
