---------00:00----------
all right so today we're going to be

---------00:01----------
working on an interesting new experiment

---------00:02----------
so there's a common problem with the

---------00:05----------
2013 through 16 MacBook Air with water

---------00:08----------
damage where the there's a line to the

---------00:10----------
CPU that gets killed okay so what

---------00:13----------
happens when this line to the CPU gets

---------00:15----------
destroyed is you'll see something like

---------00:16----------
this it'll say Bluetooth keyboard set up

---------00:18----------
there isn't a keyboard connected as

---------00:21----------
you'll see I can't move the mouse around

---------00:24----------
and the caps lock key on the keyboard

---------00:26----------
here doesn't work at all

---------00:28----------
so the caps lock key is not turning

---------00:30----------
green however if I turn it off and then

---------00:33----------
I hold down the option key I can use the

---------00:35----------
mouse the mouse will move around

---------00:38----------
I can click I can choose a Wi-Fi network

---------00:44----------
and I can even type and it backspace so

---------00:48----------
the keyboard in the trackpad that are

---------00:49----------
not working in the operating system work

---------00:51----------
fine when I'm here in EFI mode and the

---------00:54----------
reason for this is that the machine is

---------00:55----------
going to use a different data line with

---------00:57----------
the CPU when it's an EFI murder versus

---------01:00----------
when it's in the operating system

---------01:01----------
so there's STI data line where the track

---------01:04----------
pet sends the keyboard in the trackpad

---------01:06----------
signal to the CPU as an SPI data line

---------01:09----------
and that's for when it's in the

---------01:10----------
operating system when you're in efi mode

---------01:12----------
it sends the trackpad and keyboard

---------01:14----------
signal MUX to the CPU as a USB data

---------01:17----------
signal why does Apple use a USB data

---------01:19----------
line when you're in EFI mode and an SPI

---------01:22----------
data line when you're in the operating

---------01:23----------
system if I know but it does and

---------01:28----------
it's just it's another it's just another

---------01:31----------
thing that can die

---------01:33----------
so here the SPI data line for the

---------01:36----------
trackpad to the CPU is is screwed so

---------01:40----------
that doesn't work so we're going to try

---------01:41----------
to do here is we're going to try to

---------01:43----------
convert this on my trackpad connector

---------01:45----------
I'm getting my three volts at pin 10 a

---------01:48----------
very common causes if you don't have

---------01:49----------
three volts at 1010 you won't get

---------01:51----------
trackpad and keyboard working but here I

---------01:53----------
do and another common cause is let's say

---------01:57----------
SMC lid is is stuck down or anything

---------02:01----------
like that so the first thing we have to

---------02:03----------
do is figure out how it is we make this

---------02:05----------
thing stuck in USB mode all the time and

---------02:08----------
then we are going to after putting it in

---------02:11----------
USB mode I'm going to see if it works

---------02:13----------
with this bi-directional data line to

---------02:15----------
the CPU and if that doesn't work we're

---------02:17----------
going to tie it to another data line

---------02:19----------
that's available so USB so the first

---------02:21----------
thing we have to do is see how we get

---------02:22----------
this thing out of SPI mode even when

---------02:24----------
we're in the operating system so let's

---------02:26----------
take a look at how that works so here we

---------02:27----------
have trackpad USB if enable connected

---------02:30----------
which seems obvious enough to me and now

---------02:33----------
we have trackpad SPI if enable connected

---------02:35----------
so what I want to do is I want to get

---------02:38----------
rid of trackpad SPI FN con and keep

---------02:40----------
trackpad USB FN con this logic gate

---------02:43----------
trackpad USB if n Khan is present which

---------02:47----------
is present when trackpad USB if enabled

---------02:49----------
is present in p.m. sleep as for Ella's

---------02:50----------
present meaning if we're in an s4 state

---------02:52----------
and trackpad USB if enable from the PCH

---------02:55----------
is coming through then we will get this

---------02:57----------
on

---------02:57----------
now obviously I'm always going to want

---------02:59----------
this here even when we're in the

---------03:00----------
operating system and one thing to keep

---------03:01----------
in mind is the PCH may not send this

---------03:03----------
signal when we boot into the operating

---------03:05----------
system so I'm going to force it there

---------03:06----------
all the time

---------03:06----------
the next thing to consider over here is

---------03:09----------
trackpad spi if enable that's most

---------03:11----------
likely going to allow this signal to

---------03:14----------
come through if we are in an operating

---------03:16----------
system so I want to get rid of this

---------03:18----------
signal this is actually really an easy

---------03:23----------
thing to do I'm just going to take you

---------03:27----------
this

---------03:50----------
so now USB is always going to be high

---------03:53----------
and the USB line well let's let's see it

---------03:56----------
for the work in the operating system

---------03:57----------
let's see if us so I think now it's

---------03:59----------
going to be more question of whether a

---------04:01----------
did Apple implement drivers in the

---------04:03----------
operating system for the trackpad and

---------04:05----------
the keyboard toward via USB in addition

---------04:07----------
to SPI my second question is is this

---------04:10----------
standard so you know how when you plug

---------04:12----------
in a keyboard or a mouse it's standard

---------04:14----------
it typically doesn't need any special

---------04:15----------
drivers so is the trackpad and the

---------04:18----------
keyboard in this laptop standard to the

---------04:20----------
point where I don't need special drivers

---------04:22----------
in the operating system to which yeah

---------04:26----------
I'm not getting paid for this repair so

---------04:28----------
I'm probably not getting paid to this

---------04:30----------
but let's see one way to find out right

---------04:33----------
so let's let's plug this in so now what

---------04:37----------
we've done is we've pretty much forced

---------04:38----------
USB to be on and we're going to boot

---------04:41----------
into the operating system and see what

---------04:43----------
shows up caps log doesn't work trackpad

---------04:46----------
doesn't work it doesn't see a keyboard

---------04:47----------
now just for the hell of it I want to

---------04:49----------
see if it still works in the fi mode it

---------04:51----------
looks like I do have trackpad and

---------04:52----------
keyboard in efi mode so the only

---------04:54----------
difference between the operating system

---------04:56----------
and efi mode as far as the system is

---------04:57----------
concerned is that it doesn't have

---------04:58----------
drivers for the keyboard in the trackpad

---------05:00----------
once you've entered the operating system

---------05:02----------
that that is that is

---------05:09----------
 the operating system doesn't

---------05:12----------
have USB drivers for the trackpad inside

---------05:16----------
the OS you know what would really be

---------05:18----------
funny if a Linux disc it you know how

---------05:27----------
funny it would be if a Linux disc

---------05:28----------
actually allow the internal trackpad and

---------05:30----------
keyboard to work in the operating system

---------05:32----------
and OS 10 didn't I'm kind of curious let

---------05:34----------
me see if I have a bootable Linux USB

---------05:36----------
here it's actually difficult to plug in

---------05:37----------
the USB when this is not in the case

---------05:39----------
it's rather challenging so we're going

---------05:42----------
to choose EFI boot directly start

---------05:47----------
graphical environment ok this is system

---------05:49----------
rescue CD so it's not exactly a great

---------05:51----------
distribution for the for this type of

---------05:53----------
test it's not like it's going to come

---------05:55----------
with a bunch of software the best GUI

---------05:58----------
but this this should be fine just for

---------06:00----------
testing purposes

---------06:01----------
so what okay we're going to be selling

---------06:07----------
this customer on a conversion to Linux

---------06:10----------
this person's gonna let's see what are

---------06:13----------
we good yeah it's asking me for the load

---------06:17----------
key map oho loading a key map and the

---------06:23----------
enter key is working oh my god oh my god

---------06:26----------
tell me this works in Linux and not

---------06:28----------
Windows what the

---------06:30----------
Oh OS 10 does not have drivers for the

---------06:33----------
 trackpad that Linux does look at

---------06:35----------
this okay we're booted into system

---------06:37----------
rescue CD I'm booted into system rescue

---------06:40----------
CD you're going to zoom in we just can I

---------06:44----------
lower the screen brightness do you have

---------06:45----------
drivers are hooli kidding there's no

---------06:47----------
drivers for this is Linux

---------06:48----------
so let's see brightness key and we don't

---------06:53----------
have that so I have to lower these

---------06:55----------
seriously I have to lower the ISO on the

---------06:57----------
camera for you to see this all right let

---------06:59----------
me I'm going to lower the ISO on the

---------07:00----------
camera so that you can see this on the

---------07:02----------
screen let's see will that do it alright

---------07:10----------
so hopefully now you can track my cursor

---------07:12----------
which is over here and it's going to

---------07:16----------
move in a little circle you see my

---------07:20----------
cursor moving now this is me typing

---------07:23----------
that you know me let me just move this

---------07:25----------
over here so I'm going to type on this

---------07:29----------
 Apple drivers who says they are

---------07:39----------
best at integrating their hardware with

---------07:45----------
their software so so my proof of concept

---------07:52----------
here is confirmed this multi-touch work

---------07:54----------
dude I'm a music it's it's system rescue

---------07:58----------
CD what do you mean multi-touch what do

---------08:00----------
you add of your mind it's molded I mean

---------08:03----------
I could use I could use Ubuntu I should

---------08:05----------
I could make an Ubuntu disk to figure

---------08:08----------
this out but yeah so there's this whole

---------08:10----------
idea this is concept that Apple hardware

---------08:12----------
is just it's blends so well

---------08:15----------
with the software there's this synergy

---------08:17----------
this integration and when you get a drop

---------08:21----------
of something on the SPI data line it

---------08:23----------
dies

---------08:24----------
but wait Apple has a USB data line to

---------08:27----------
the CPU just in case your SPI data line

---------08:30----------
dies that only works if you don't use an

---------08:32----------
Apple operating system the is wrong

---------08:36----------
with you people oh my god

---------08:40----------
the day existent rescue CD has a driver

---------08:44----------
for the keyboard and the trackpad that

---------08:47----------
OS 10 does not like I mean really

---------08:51----------
seriously like is this the level that

---------08:54----------
we're at where you're not we we this is

---------08:56----------
not built into the operating system if

---------08:58----------
anybody watching this would like to

---------09:00----------
program me a driver for the MacBook Air

---------09:02----------
trackpad to work over USB and OS 10

---------09:06----------
highly appreciated hey you know wouldn't

---------09:09----------
argue with you there so that's it for

---------09:11----------
today and as always I hope that you

---------09:13----------
learned something now time for an

---------09:15----------
advertisement this is our website here

---------09:17----------
mail in dot repair you will be able to

---------09:19----------
find on most of the different cleaners

---------09:22----------
stencils connectors ICS and small chips

---------09:25----------
that we use throughout these repairs on

---------09:27----------
this website so here you'll find the

---------09:29----------
ultrasonic cleaner that we use at the

---------09:31----------
store that's fixed many other boards

---------09:33----------
that I was unable to fix in the video

---------09:34----------
this here is shipped straight from the

---------09:36----------
store here you'll see a bunch of LCD

---------09:38----------
connectors we've got keyboard connectors

---------09:41----------
we've got digitizer connectors and

---------09:42----------
they're all organized here so if you go

---------09:44----------
connectors by type or you can search by

---------09:47----------
your device if we go here components by

---------09:49----------
device iPhone iPhone 6's it'll bring you

---------09:52----------
to a screen where you'll find a bunch of

---------09:54----------
different parts for your iPhone the same

---------09:57----------
is true for stencils we've got stencils

---------09:59----------
over here like the SMC stencil that it's

---------10:00----------
typically hard to buy directly in

---------10:02----------
America you have to wait a long time to

---------10:04----------
get that from China here we've got the

---------10:06----------
some different parts like the LPP 3v4 to

---------10:10----------
regulator over here so this is a TP 3v4

---------10:13----------
to regulator you can actually search by

---------10:15----------
the number on the schematic and if there

---------10:17----------
are different ships with that same

---------10:19----------
number it'll bring up all the different

---------10:20----------
ships you can scroll down and figure out

---------10:22----------
which one is for your motherboard

---------10:24----------
because over here it'll say compatible

---------10:26----------
boards and it will list all the boards

---------10:28----------
the chip is compiled

---------10:29----------
if you don't want to deal with that you

---------10:30----------
can even just search by your motherboard

---------10:32----------
so if I search over here for a t20 3462

---------10:35----------
it will only show me chips that are

---------10:37----------
compatible with my model motherboard and

---------10:40----------
this was all put together with

---------10:43----------
high-resolution pictures that you can

---------10:45----------
compare it to your chip to make sure

---------10:47----------
that you buy the right one and if you

---------10:48----------
ever have a question feel free to email

---------10:50----------
feel free to comment feel free the live

---------10:52----------
chat so thank you very much for watching

---------10:54----------
the video thank you very much for your

---------10:55----------
patronage if you use their website we've

---------10:57----------
also got flux here if you want flux

---------11:00----------
we've got solder paste over here if you

---------11:03----------
want solder paste and we've even got

---------11:05----------
mouse pads with pictures of my

---------11:09----------
of a cat
