---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm going to be going over a

---------00:02----------
problem that a lot of new people have

---------00:04----------
when soldering really small connectors

---------00:05----------
and I'm going to go over a small tip

---------00:07----------
that you can use to make sure that you

---------00:09----------
don't solder the connector on improperly

---------00:11----------
so this here is an LCD connector and my

---------00:14----------
microscope camera is not on so to turn

---------00:16----------
that on so it acts that looked like less

---------00:19----------
of an idiot come on there we go alright

---------00:24----------
so one of the things that I would

---------00:25----------
suggest that you do when soldering any

---------00:27----------
type of connector this is the one that

---------00:29----------
was sent in that was previously worked

---------00:31----------
on somebody couldn't get going properly

---------00:33----------
so is to check it with your tweezers so

---------00:36----------
this also one of the things I want you

---------00:38----------
to know this over here is a decent joint

---------00:40----------
this over here is a little bit too much

---------00:42----------
solder on it's the blob you don't want a

---------00:45----------
blob so that the problem with the solder

---------00:47----------
blob and you can see it this is kind of

---------00:49----------
like moving over here

---------00:50----------
the problem with this blob is that just

---------00:53----------
because you have a lot of solder on the

---------00:54----------
top does not mean it's actually made a

---------00:55----------
good connection to the copper under it

---------00:57----------
you really want a good connection to the

---------00:59----------
copper under which means the copper and

---------01:01----------
the solder is going to follow the heat

---------01:02----------
so you want this you don't want it to

---------01:03----------
shove a clump of solder on top of this

---------01:06----------
you want this over here to actually get

---------01:08----------
hot but the tip that I want to give you

---------01:11----------
that everybody should follow if they're

---------01:12----------
first getting started is to tap each pin

---------01:15----------
with your tweezers so just take a set of

---------01:18----------
tweezers and don't be scared I know a

---------01:20----------
lot of people have said you know what if

---------01:21----------
I break the pins when I've tried to show

---------01:23----------
them this in person but here's the thing

---------01:25----------
if the pin moves or something breaks

---------01:27----------
while you're doing this then wouldn't

---------01:29----------
you like to know that in the beginning

---------01:30----------
rather than figuring out that it's not

---------01:33----------
connected later and over here you can

---------01:35----------
get to what it is that's not connected

---------01:37----------
me to zoom in a little so you can see

---------01:38----------
that better look at this see I was able

---------01:41----------
clearly move this pin with the tweezers

---------01:43----------
and it is not soldered on to the board

---------01:47----------
and there's a couple more that are going

---------01:49----------
to be like that so let's see if this is

---------01:50----------
fixable now the most common cause of

---------01:52----------
this is that the connector itself is too

---------01:54----------
high on the board and you can see over

---------01:55----------
here that that appears to be the case so

---------01:57----------
watch what happens here if I touch this

---------01:59----------
see that it's sitting too high on the

---------02:02----------
board that is a big part of the problem

---------02:04----------
when the connector is closer to the

---------02:06----------
board you have less of this problem

---------02:09----------
I'm just going to turn on the air filter

---------02:11----------
here and see what I can do so first let

---------02:15----------
me see if I can save the old connector

---------02:18----------
we're going to see if we can save the

---------02:20----------
old one so I'm going to try to lower it

---------02:23----------
on each side over here

---------02:29----------
[Music]

---------02:33----------
so I'm going to put on a tip that's a

---------02:35----------
little bit better suited to this and my

---------02:39----------
station is going to beep at me because

---------02:40----------
that's what it does it beeps at me it

---------02:43----------
beeps

---------02:46----------
Echo's way of saying fu mofo we're never

---------02:49----------
going to sponsor your channel and all

---------02:52----------
right I'm going to do is I'm going to

---------02:57----------
push down after I edit my flux I'm going

---------02:58----------
to push down over here and as I'm

---------03:01----------
pushing down I'm going to touch the iron

---------03:03----------
to the corner and just make that a

---------03:06----------
little bit less Glary for you it's a

---------03:09----------
push down and then same for the other

---------03:15----------
side now push down and bam all right so

---------03:23----------
now and okay there is solder inside this

---------03:33----------
connector so this actually has to go all

---------03:36----------
right so that connector has got to get

---------03:37----------
so it's from the garbage because there's

---------03:39----------
solder inside of it and without cheap

---------03:41----------
these things are I'm not fishing solder

---------03:42----------
out of a connector but just before we do

---------03:44----------
that I might as well show you how it is

---------03:46----------
we can correct these pins over here that

---------03:49----------
are not soldered to the board properly

---------03:54----------
get the right angle here in the camera

---------04:01----------
come on there we go

---------04:05----------
watch add some fun you want to heat the

---------04:10----------
pin and the pad you don't just want to

---------04:12----------
shove solder on it see I'm making sure

---------04:15----------
that the iron is touching both the pad

---------04:16----------
and the pin because I because the solder

---------04:19----------
is going to flow to whatever it's hot so

---------04:21----------
it's important that I make both the pin

---------04:22----------
in the pad hot now watch what happens

---------04:24----------
over here see what I did I just tapped

---------04:28----------
it like this but I made sure that I was

---------04:30----------
touching the pin in the pad and also if

---------04:32----------
you're a troll you may notice that I

---------04:33----------
also melted the plastic over there but

---------04:35----------
who really cares because this connect is

---------04:37----------
going in the garbage anyway we're going

---------04:39----------
to do that with each one of these I'm

---------04:40----------
going to make sure that I'm making the

---------04:41----------
pin hot and the pad hot and if we go

---------04:45----------
back to that pin that was not sticking

---------04:47----------
right not sitting down you can see I can

---------04:49----------
push and I can push and it isn't come on

---------04:52----------
again you don't want to push too hard

---------04:53----------
you don't want to rip the pads off the

---------04:55----------
board because ripping the pads off the

---------04:56----------
board is not very nice not very nice

---------04:59----------
thing to do so I'm going to take my hot

---------05:02----------
air station here and tell this connector

---------05:04----------
that it can GTFO it's time for this

---------05:11----------
connector to go

---------05:18----------
laughs not all is worth saving you can

---------05:23----------
see I've got my hot air station over

---------05:25----------
here and think that's my entire

---------05:31----------
connector not going to get too close to

---------05:33----------
the board to give it a little bit of a

---------05:34----------
preheating first by the way don't do

---------05:38----------
this when the assembly is actually

---------05:40----------
attached to the machine because if you

---------05:41----------
do then you're going to burn the clutch

---------05:43----------
cover and that's not good that's one of

---------05:48----------
the things that you're not allowed to

---------05:50----------
burn okay you're going to remove the old

---------05:54----------
connector let's see if I can show you

---------05:58----------
what it looks like on the inside

---------06:00----------
if it came off well I can show you what

---------06:03----------
I mean when I say solder inside the

---------06:04----------
connector although it may have moved it

---------06:07----------
moved so you're not going to be able to

---------06:09----------
see it now well old connector go back so

---------06:15----------
first thing we're going to do is I'm

---------06:17----------
going to wick this and just to irritate

---------06:20----------
the person on eevblog that hates my

---------06:22----------
soldering I am going to wick it all the

---------06:25----------
way across so usually the way that

---------06:28----------
you're supposed to wick is like this

---------06:29----------
you're supposed to you're technically

---------06:32----------
supposed to wick with the pan so you're

---------06:34----------
going to do something like this with

---------06:35----------
your wick so you're going to see this

---------06:38----------
pad is going from this direction to this

---------06:40----------
direction from here to here here to here

---------06:42----------
so you would wick from here to here but

---------06:47----------
just just because the engineers don't

---------06:50----------
like that that's because the engineer so

---------06:52----------
that's how I'm supposed to do it I'm

---------06:53----------
going to do it the other way just to

---------06:54----------
show that you can do it without ripping

---------06:55----------
a single pet so note what I'm doing here

---------06:58----------
is that I'm moving with the wick and I'm

---------07:00----------
barely touching the board see what I'm

---------07:03----------
doing here is I am barely touching with

---------07:06----------
like the the iron I'm not pushing

---------07:08----------
because a lot of people don't get that

---------07:10----------
I'm not pushing what I'm doing is I'm

---------07:12----------
gliding I'm floating

---------07:15----------
like a butterfly butterfly lik like a

---------07:18----------
bee

---------07:19----------
kind of thing that it's satisfying

---------07:23----------
[Music]

---------07:26----------
counter trolling the engineers is smooth

---------07:29----------
and satisfying it's almost as satisfying

---------07:34----------
is not pronouncing the L in solder now

---------07:39----------
we're going to clean it off and attach

---------07:41----------
the new connector and it's going to be

---------07:42----------
beautiful it's going to be great it's

---------07:44----------
going to be huge gonna be awesome take a

---------07:49----------
little bit of 99% alcohol and clean this

---------07:52----------
area off

---------07:56----------
[Music]

---------08:02----------
okay and now we are going to take the

---------08:07----------
connector and put that right on the blue

---------08:11----------
now this is a little hard to do for

---------08:14----------
newbies for a couple of reasons so I

---------08:16----------
typically you should be adding solder

---------08:19----------
anytime that you're heating the

---------08:20----------
motherboard anytime you're heating

---------08:22----------
whatever it is you're soldering because

---------08:24----------
there is flux inside the solder and once

---------08:26----------
the flux inside the solder is all used

---------08:28----------
up and it gets used up via heat then

---------08:30----------
it's dis luckily solder is not going to

---------08:32----------
flow well get all clumpy so I need one

---------08:34----------
hand hold the iron one hand hold the

---------08:36----------
solder and one hand to hold the

---------08:38----------
connector and until I can figure out how

---------08:40----------
to hold the connector with my dick I am

---------08:42----------
stuck with two hands which means that I

---------08:45----------
am going to have to I'm going to have to

---------08:48----------
improvise a little bit

---------08:50----------
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

---------08:51----------
add my own slot that when this the flux

---------08:53----------
and solder is burned away I still have

---------08:56----------
the flux that I custom added to the

---------08:58----------
board

---------09:03----------
and hopefully it helps you avoid what

---------09:07----------
was for me and many other people a

---------09:09----------
common newbie mistake so now what I'm

---------09:11----------
going to put some solder on the tip of

---------09:13----------
my iron and the flux inside the solder

---------09:15----------
you'll see is going to burn away and if

---------09:17----------
my camera is good enough and YouTube

---------09:19----------
doesn't compresses the [ __ ] you'll be

---------09:20----------
even be able to see that see that that

---------09:22----------
is that see that stuff that's smoking

---------09:23----------
see that that is the flux inside the

---------09:26----------
solder and it's all burned away it's

---------09:28----------
gone now the solder is still there but

---------09:29----------
the flux is burned away so it's not

---------09:30----------
going to flow nicely if I were to just

---------09:32----------
shove it someone and you can see that

---------09:34----------
that flux was absorbed into my fume

---------09:36----------
extractor which by the way if you're

---------09:37----------
doing this professionally if you're

---------09:39----------
doing this at all or especially if you

---------09:41----------
have employees who don't really have a

---------09:42----------
say in the matter you should have a fume

---------09:44----------
extractor just for health reasons did

---------09:48----------
you know if you're afraid of getting in

---------09:50----------
trouble with your boss just realize your

---------09:51----------
health is not worth screwing it with

---------09:54----------
your health is not worth your boss

---------09:55----------
saving 100 or something bucks ok so now

---------09:59----------
again I'm going to touch the solder over

---------10:00----------
here and because I'm doing a live video

---------10:04----------
I'm going to screw it up great didn't

---------10:07----------
put enough solder on the iron so we're

---------10:08----------
going to go again

---------10:09----------
go figure that can you turn the camera

---------10:14----------
on nothing will work that is life okay

---------10:18----------
attempt number two I remembered the

---------10:20----------
issue before was that the connector was

---------10:21----------
too high on the board which may depend a

---------10:24----------
little too high which is why I'm

---------10:25----------
pressing down as I'm soldering

---------10:31----------
so we're going to get that one over here

---------10:37----------
see I want to heat both that's what's

---------10:39----------
important and it's a little difficult to

---------10:41----------
do over here because this is a this is a

---------10:44----------
really cramped area I got the ethernet

---------10:46----------
transformer right above me see you can a

---------10:48----------
transformer over here and I can

---------10:50----------
technically burn the outside of it but I

---------10:53----------
like to avoid doing that because it

---------10:54----------
looks nasty when you do that so now what

---------11:01----------
I'm going to do over here because I

---------11:02----------
really don't have a lot of room is now

---------11:07----------
I'm going to I have to push down on the

---------11:08----------
board remember I have to push down so

---------11:09----------
that it's flat on this side as well so

---------11:11----------
I'm going to add some flux to that I'm

---------11:16----------
going to push down and on the connector

---------11:19----------
not too hard just enough and then I'm

---------11:21----------
going to make sure that I'm heating both

---------11:23----------
the pin and the pad you can't just eat

---------11:26----------
one you can't or none at all and just

---------11:28----------
keep the soldering you got to do both in

---------11:31----------
order for this to work there we go

---------11:35----------
and of course I got a tiny little bit of

---------11:40----------
solder on the top go figure

---------11:42----------
alright so now we're going to do the

---------11:43----------
side

---------11:47----------
and you want to be careful with the

---------11:49----------
sides you want to be very careful with

---------11:51----------
the side the reason is is if you get too

---------11:54----------
much in the sides it will leak inside

---------11:55----------
the connector and then you won't be able

---------11:57----------
to put anything into it and that's very

---------11:59----------
very bad and I should change tips for

---------12:03----------
this this is not the perfect tip to be

---------12:05----------
doing that to the BCM to tell anybody I

---------12:15----------
stole its tip

---------12:28----------
this is a different tip takes a little

---------12:30----------
longer to heat up a larger tip but it is

---------12:34----------
more flat a well actually this is the

---------12:41----------
this is this is insanity

---------12:45----------
I love the screw so that's it it's a

---------12:47----------
little bigger than I always used to

---------13:00----------
[Music]

---------13:09----------
[Music]

---------13:19----------
it's all you got to do

---------13:22----------
see knives minimal amount now the same

---------13:27----------
thing for the other side and of course

---------13:33----------
the other side is surrounded with an

---------13:35----------
Ethernet transformer go figure and all

---------13:39----------
sorts of other fun stuff nice try

---------13:45----------
sucking up my paper towel into the fume

---------13:47----------
extractor it's hungry

---------13:50----------
once food coming in so do I so let's

---------13:54----------
finish this up hi I need to get some

---------13:59----------
food for myself and my fume extractor so

---------14:02----------
it starts eating our chips you got to be

---------14:06----------
nice to these things that's why I

---------14:07----------
understand a lot of employers don't have

---------14:09----------
the fume extractor because it's

---------14:10----------
expensive and after you buy it it's high

---------14:12----------
maintenance it eats your chips I

---------14:15----------
understand that you should still buy it

---------14:17----------
for your health even though it does eat

---------14:18----------
your chips trust me I understand the

---------14:21----------
pain and the theme extractor eating your

---------14:22----------
chips

---------14:24----------
[Music]

---------14:35----------
and instead it's too big for this [ __ ]

---------14:37----------
where is the other one flat one that we

---------14:40----------
have

---------14:44----------
Kanna

---------14:51----------
like we had one like that that was not

---------14:53----------
as large and obnoxious

---------15:01----------
and we do here we go this wasn't in the

---------15:04----------
this is what I was looking for no wonder

---------15:07----------
[Music]

---------15:14----------
[Music]

---------15:19----------
always helps when you grab the right tip

---------15:29----------
this is what I'm looking for

---------15:32----------
okay much better this size is much more

---------15:37----------
suit

---------15:45----------
yeah much better I don't know what the

---------15:48----------
hell I was doing with that other one

---------15:51----------
make sure you grab the right tip

---------15:56----------
they're now my connector as a birthmark

---------15:58----------
it's fine study you probably

---------16:03----------
Oh fine yeah just make sure you have a

---------16:11----------
nice connection without getting any

---------16:13----------
solder into the front I may have stolen

---------16:18----------
your tip I was trying to use this one

---------16:23----------
but it's what I thought this is the one

---------16:24----------
that you're always telling me to use but

---------16:26----------
this is huge yeah you know it's not bad

---------16:31----------
but I can't do that LCD connector with

---------16:33----------
it

---------16:33----------
it's a smaller one yeah I thought that

---------16:38----------
that was the size and I'm like I can't

---------16:39----------
can't be the one that Jason keeps

---------16:40----------
recommending me

---------16:44----------
[Music]

---------16:46----------
just to troll me to make you think it

---------16:48----------
was my fault in my failure this is what

---------16:51----------
I work with every day alright so now

---------16:56----------
we're going to go over these pins and

---------16:59----------
they're going to look they're going to

---------17:00----------
go great so I'm going to just move this

---------17:01----------
and where the LCD connector is company

---------17:04----------
come to the location for me one thing is

---------17:07----------
you always want to make sure that you're

---------17:08----------
comfortable don't because I see people

---------17:10----------
driving themselves nuts on their desks

---------17:12----------
so that they can keep the machine in the

---------17:14----------
exact same position it was when they put

---------17:16----------
it on their desk and I don't understand

---------17:17----------
that the minute you should be

---------17:19----------
comfortable like the machine is not

---------17:21----------
going to feel whether or not you are

---------17:22----------
comfortable

---------17:23----------
[Music]

---------17:29----------
at any point now patrol was they nice

---------17:34----------
10:31 yes yeah

---------17:39----------
[Music]

---------17:44----------
yeah yeah

---------17:46----------
[Music]

---------17:56----------
gather ye rosebuds while ye may

---------17:59----------
[Music]

---------18:03----------
gather your trolls while you may

---------18:07----------
[Music]

---------18:17----------
you can't get out of it a little piece

---------18:20----------
of dirt going sure shoot

---------18:26----------
[Music]

---------18:28----------
erase I'm on 18 minutes and is not done

---------18:34----------
yet

---------18:43----------
and I meant to pin

---------18:45----------
which means I'm going to hear about it

---------18:47----------
on eevblog forum not Dave the forum or a

---------18:55----------
hat

---------19:00----------
know this person - Chinese hurt

---------19:14----------
now I've got my cheating tip

---------19:26----------
which I can use to pull the pan away

---------19:40----------
[Music]

---------20:06----------
and a little bit of cleaning and then we

---------20:11----------
call it a day this is so old that I

---------20:18----------
don't even have a test LCD in my test

---------20:20----------
LCD housing thing next to me it's

---------20:23----------
interesting our time goes by when I

---------20:26----------
started doing this this machine was was

---------20:29----------
one month old Wow time passes

---------20:35----------
[Music]

---------20:39----------
of time passes

---------20:44----------
I'm old

---------20:53----------
do keep in mind even though I'm using a

---------20:55----------
q-tip what I'm doing is I'm spinning it

---------20:58----------
rather than moving it back and forth

---------20:59----------
this way all the fibers from the q-tip

---------21:02----------
we're just going to stay wrapped around

---------21:03----------
the q-tip rather than falling onto the

---------21:05----------
board a little bit of common sense goes

---------21:08----------
a long way

---------21:09----------
[Music]

---------21:28----------
okay and then we remove the one trolling

---------21:32----------
fiber

---------21:36----------
[Music]

---------21:40----------
and then we do this because my OCD is

---------21:44----------
not going to bother me if I see that

---------21:46----------
little Hershey's kiss on that beauty

---------21:49----------
theater this day

---------21:54----------
okay Phoebe and then we get to see if

---------22:02----------
this whole beautiful job works which I'm

---------22:05----------
sure it does how it I'm so sure this

---------22:10----------
works I don't even have to plug it in

---------22:18----------
okay here's hoping the screen that I

---------22:21----------
bought sometime in 2010 that I'm still

---------22:24----------
using as a tester still works

---------22:32----------
that's the time

---------22:42----------

---------22:45----------
yeah that's it

---------23:12----------
that suspense man

---------23:37----------
yay Madison stand straight

---------23:42----------
come on

---------23:53----------
great the connector on the screen is

---------23:56----------
broken I have to keep my thumb on the

---------24:05----------
connector for my seven year old screen

---------24:17----------
question mark

---------24:56----------
should I get a screen that doesn't have

---------24:57----------
a broken connector on it aha here we go

---------25:05----------
yeah all right I pushed my finger in

---------25:08----------
place and as you can see there is a

---------25:10----------
blinking question mark and on the board

---------25:12----------
itself I can tap on that connector as

---------25:15----------
much as I want and it is nice and sturdy

---------25:17----------
which is more than I can say from my

---------25:20----------
piece of crap seven-year-old test to

---------25:22----------
screen so that's it for today and as

---------25:25----------
always I hope you learned something
