---------00:00----------
we're going to open and fix another

---------00:01----------
MacBook this MacBook is a 12-inch

---------00:03----------
MacBook one of my least favorite of all

---------00:05----------
the Mac books but one of Paul's favorite

---------00:07----------
of all the Mac books the most common

---------00:10----------
issue with this MacBook is that the CPU

---------00:12----------
will be dead

---------00:13----------
it'll take standard startup voltage

---------00:15----------
it'll put boot up with no video no chime

---------00:19----------
no nothing so this looks like it takes

---------00:21----------
0.03 amps this is an a 1534 it has no

---------00:26----------
liquid damage it has no physical damage

---------00:33----------
hi Paul I don't want to work on this

---------00:37----------
this machine this is not going to be

---------00:40----------
fixable

---------00:52----------
it's taking 0.03 amps spiking a 0.06 for

---------00:59----------
its excuse me let's open up the board

---------01:04----------
view for this piece of crap little

---------01:07----------
iPhone of a computer all right where's

---------01:10----------
my list of power or else first we start

---------01:12----------
with our pp bus g3 hot this era how do

---------01:14----------
you say PP bus g3 hot and Swedish ok 8.6

---------01:19----------
2 volts next up ep 3 p3 underscore g3

---------01:25----------
hot 3.3 dad I know is present this thing

---------01:30----------
here because pp 3 B 3 R 3 v-0 is needed

---------01:32----------
for us to get voltage in the charger PPV

---------01:35----------
RTC underscore g3 hi

---------01:43----------
three point three we'd be five eg three

---------01:48----------
hot L do let's check this one PP bus g3

---------01:53----------
the German the German you say the German

---------02:01----------
Village Annan okay

---------02:11----------
the five volts maybe five es for let's

---------02:16----------
check for that zero point zero nine to

---------02:19----------
zero point O its boot looping what do

---------02:23----------
you know what creates PP 5 es 4

---------02:38----------
oh there's no previous Paul Daniels is

---------02:42----------
an evil man because he created he has

---------02:44----------
the software for the PDF reading it has

---------02:46----------
next for find but no previous what kind

---------02:50----------
of evil serial killer like sociopathic

---------02:53----------
individual will create software like

---------02:57----------
this so you 7600 appears to be the p.m.

---------03:02----------
I see is there a short on this rail 140

---------03:10----------
ohms that seems kind of on the low side

---------03:15----------
here but it also seems to high that I'm

---------03:19----------
actually yeah it's going over a kilo

---------03:21----------
lame I'm never gonna find that short you

---------03:26----------
should learn some Swedish only I had a

---------03:29----------
teacher vods svenska death blog our

---------03:33----------
plots get what the hell did I say there

---------03:41----------
are there any rare anything here that

---------03:43----------
looks nasty that could be causing this

---------03:45----------
anything that looks obviously

---------03:46----------
short-circuited

---------04:24----------
okay I'm gonna see if there's a

---------04:28----------
short-circuit on any particular rail so

---------04:30----------
we're just gonna go down the list see if

---------04:33----------
any have a low resistance that I

---------04:35----------
wouldn't be expecting maybe five ESO DB

---------04:41----------
5 ESO is

---------04:55----------
over here point eight ohms okay see this

---------05:02----------
is a short circuit that we have to find

---------05:04----------
so what we had was boot looping where it

---------05:09----------
was turning on off on off it was taking

---------05:11----------
0.06 amps and then 0.03 and going on and

---------05:14----------
off on and off my PP 5 es 4 rail was

---------05:17----------
shooting up to 5 and then going down

---------05:18----------
very quickly so simply going down the

---------05:21----------
list of rails we stopped we went down a

---------05:23----------
PP 5 ESO and over here we have a short

---------05:27----------
circuit to ground which is straight up

---------05:31----------
0.08 ohms that is an obvious short

---------05:34----------
circuit to ground that does need to be

---------05:36----------
addressed so we are going to do that now

---------05:40----------
go we're just gonna inject something

---------05:43----------
into this board we're gonna clip ground

---------05:46----------
to ground manfully united thank you for

---------05:54----------
the multiple sex and we're gonna take

---------05:59----------
this

---------06:03----------
all right so we're gonna put some

---------06:24----------
voltage into this board and see what

---------06:27----------
gets warm this one I'm likely gonna want

---------06:30----------
my thermal camphor so it'll be worth

---------06:32----------
getting up to get to it okay we got the

---------06:35----------
thermal camera here what's getting hot

---------06:56----------
tell me the cpu is was getting hot here

---------07:22----------
it's not the CPU this thing doesn't have

---------07:27----------
a zoom feature so I don't think I'm

---------07:29----------
gonna be able to find it particularly

---------07:31----------
easily okay so it's whatever is under

---------07:40----------
the mouse so I'm gonna take my tweezer

---------07:42----------
and the mouse moved mofo it's ok I

---------07:53----------
can't tell this thermo camera is too low

---------07:55----------
resolution 900 bucks this thing's too

---------07:58----------
 low resolution $900 thermal cam

---------08:01----------
and I'm gonna resort to alcohol because

---------08:05----------
it works but in my eyes cuz it works

---------08:07----------
better

---------08:08----------
so it's something down here in this

---------08:09----------
corner right let's see what could it be

---------08:43----------
all right capacitor it's this guy this

---------08:48----------
little capacitor right here has got to

---------08:49----------
go well we can't heat the CPU so then I

---------08:54----------
cover the cpu with this little metal

---------08:57----------
rubbery spudger thingy and that caps

---------09:02----------
going to go

---------09:19----------
and the cap starting to get a little

---------09:20----------
malformed so yeah it's you

---------09:27----------
whoa check that out is that an angry

---------09:32----------
capper what holy moly look at that just

---------09:38----------
split into pieces

---------09:59----------
uh-uh

---------10:01----------
I'll help I did something incredibly

---------10:05----------
stupid trying to move that capacitor and

---------10:08----------
I don't over the capacitor and I did

---------10:11----------
this please help I finally found the

---------10:17----------
name 1534 that's not dead CPU help help

---------10:20----------
so Paul is going to save me since I

---------10:22----------
screwed something up like an idiot thank

---------10:26----------
God for Paul thank God for people like

---------10:29----------
Paul exist

---------10:51----------
Paul said that the auto mechanicing

---------10:54----------
sucked I can't imagine this sucks less

---------11:01----------
Duke is excited to start fixing Tesla's

---------11:04----------
and all those things you said it's going

---------11:08----------
to be fun what's the part that sucks

---------11:31----------
what sucks about when they do provide

---------11:34----------
you the parts in the information on your

---------11:41----------
body what about the customers aren't

---------11:47----------
they nicer than our customers now

---------12:03----------
hmmm that was sexy I was really

---------12:06----------
expecting that to explode everywhere

---------12:07----------
weren't you a little bit oh my god

---------12:11----------
that's Qasim that's a nice ball

---------12:40----------
dream believer da da da da da

---------12:47----------
do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do

---------12:51----------
do-do-do-do-do why don't I have the

---------12:54----------
monkey's stuck in my head

---------12:57----------
[Music]

---------13:12----------
damn it

---------13:21----------
I did not just the pads oh you jested

---------13:25----------
them what do you mean when you say Jessa

---------13:27----------
exactly oh you mean to wick the pads

---------13:29----------
because Jessa typically wicks the pads

---------13:31----------
before putting stuff on the board right

---------13:32----------
I love them working a little micro BGA's

---------13:36----------
like that do you think Jessa's watching

---------13:40----------
right now

---------13:50----------
you

---------13:57----------
you

---------14:13----------
let's see if this turns on if it does

---------14:15----------
we're gonna do a little bit of shopping

---------14:16----------
for a new computer and then I'm gonna

---------14:20----------
buy the memory that you guys suggest and

---------14:22----------
look it looks like it's probably turning

---------14:23----------
on but one way to find out is to plug in

---------14:26----------
it and see if we get a picture this

---------14:28----------
would mean that the touch bar that I

---------14:29----------
chose was an easy one

---------14:32----------
the 12 inch I chose was an easy one

---------14:35----------
plug in show me an Apple logo taking

---------14:38----------
point five amps with no battery plugged

---------14:40----------
in which is a good sign

---------14:42----------
Oh an apple logo an Apple logo II work

---------14:49----------
fixed have you rent any repairs made

---------14:51----------
impossible by teacher chip not yet

---------14:53----------
because I haven't worked them any other

---------14:54----------
minute it works it's fixed this MacBook

---------14:59----------
has been fixed in a 1534 oh yeah

---------15:04----------
that's awesome so we removed a short on

---------15:07----------
pp5 eso we found the short by going

---------15:09----------
through the list of power rails I

---------15:10----------
noticed that pp 5 ps4 was going up down

---------15:13----------
up down up down so when you're getting

---------15:15----------
boot looping like that or that kind of

---------15:17----------
boot cycling what I like to do is I like

---------15:18----------
to check every single power rail and

---------15:20----------
after checking every single power route

---------15:21----------
we found that one of them had a zero

---------15:25----------
point something I'm short to ground 0.4

---------15:27----------
0.5 home and when we found it thanks to

---------15:31----------
the thermal camera injecting a little

---------15:32----------
bit of voltage we removed it and now the

---------15:35----------
MacBook is fixed oh yeah fixed MacBook

---------15:40----------
MacBook look dad we found the short we

---------15:47----------
fix the short the MacBook works the

---------15:52----------
macbook works beautiful MacBook on to

---------15:57----------
the next repair and thank you all for

---------16:00----------
watching
