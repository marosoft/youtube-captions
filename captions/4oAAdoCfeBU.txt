---------00:00----------
hello and welcome back for another

---------00:01----------
episode of component-level order pair so

---------00:04----------
today as with all these videos we're

---------00:05----------
gonna try to walk you through figuring

---------00:07----------
out what's wrong with the board that's

---------00:08----------
dead and not powering on and there's a

---------00:10----------
lot of thought in this general community

---------00:12----------
that you have to be an electronics

---------00:14----------
engineer you have to be a physicist you

---------00:15----------
have to be some some level genius in

---------00:17----------
order to understand a lot of what's

---------00:19----------
going on here and one of the things that

---------00:20----------
I try to do with this channel is I

---------00:21----------
really try to distill it down to just

---------00:23----------
being basic common sense and detective

---------00:25----------
work to give you the idea that with just

---------00:27----------
a little bit of learning and a little

---------00:29----------
bit of just understanding some basic

---------00:30----------
concepts that you can follow along and

---------00:32----------
you can work on stuff like this and you

---------00:35----------
can actually figure it out so long as

---------00:37----------
you're willing to learn and have an

---------00:38----------
analytical mindset so let's go ahead and

---------00:40----------
get into this board this is an eight to

---------00:42----------
zero twenty eight forty nine board and

---------00:45----------
when I plug it in you'll notice that I

---------00:48----------
do get a green light however it doesn't

---------00:50----------
power on now let's go over the list of

---------00:54----------
power rails because the first thing I

---------00:55----------
might want to do in a no power condition

---------00:57----------
is I'm gonna want to look through the

---------00:58----------
power rails and try to figure out which

---------00:59----------
rail it is that's missing so these

---------01:02----------
machines are always gonna have a number

---------01:04----------
of different power lines they're gonna

---------01:05----------
have a 12 volt line a 5 volt line a 3

---------01:08----------
volt line a 1.5 volt line a point 75

---------01:11----------
volt line and so on and so forth in

---------01:13----------
different lines are gonna want to be on

---------01:14----------
in different states so for example when

---------01:17----------
the machine is sleeping you're not gonna

---------01:19----------
want to have the CPU on but you are

---------01:21----------
going to want have the RAM on so that it

---------01:23----------
saves whatever you had so that when you

---------01:24----------
open the machine everything shows up

---------01:26----------
again or when it's off you don't want

---------01:28----------
have the RAM of the CPU on but you do

---------01:30----------
want the battery to be charging so that

---------01:32----------
when you went off charge the battery now

---------01:35----------
what we're gonna do is we're gonna go

---------01:36----------
through a list of rails and we're gonna

---------01:38----------
measure each one of these rails to see

---------01:40----------
which one is going to show up and which

---------01:43----------
ones don't show up so over here I'm just

---------01:46----------
gonna show you where I find my list of

---------01:48----------
rails now any good schematic or diagram

---------01:51----------
is going to give you a list of the power

---------01:52----------
rails that you should expect to have

---------01:54----------
here so we're gonna start with pp bus g3

---------01:57----------
hot and here we're gonna use our handy

---------01:59----------
dandy board view software in order to

---------02:00----------
find each one of these rails so the

---------02:02----------
first rail that I'm gonna look for is pp

---------02:04----------
bus g3 hot and this is a rail that's

---------02:08----------
supposed to be a believ 8 point

---------02:10----------
something volts on this model machine so

---------02:12----------
we're gonna go ahead and measure

---------02:13----------
with the multimeter and see what the

---------02:15----------
multimeter gives us let's try and get

---------02:18----------
the multimeter so it's actually visible

---------02:20----------
on the screen

---------02:22----------
there we go so we're barely visible in

---------02:26----------
my case okay so we take our black probe

---------02:33----------
and we put it on ground because ground

---------02:37----------
is gonna be zero in this case we take

---------02:38----------
the meter we turn it to DC voltage which

---------02:41----------
is gonna be voltage with a flat line at

---------02:42----------
the top and then we place the black

---------02:45----------
probe where we are looking for voltage

---------02:47----------
to be and the idea here is it's going to

---------02:49----------
measure the difference between these two

---------02:51----------
points eight point 33 volts that's what

---------02:55----------
I'm expecting now we're gonna move on to

---------02:57----------
the next rail which is going to be pp 3

---------02:59----------
before - now pp 3 before - is used for

---------03:02----------
the 1 wire circuit if you don't know

---------03:03----------
what the 1 wire circuit is you can watch

---------03:05----------
some of my older videos and what the 1

---------03:06----------
wire circuit is a long story short is

---------03:10----------
that the 1 wire circuit is what's going

---------03:12----------
to be used in order to give you a green

---------03:13----------
light on the charger so let's just fast

---------03:16----------
forward over to that section so I can

---------03:18----------
explain some of that for you now the

---------03:21----------
whole idea here is that this max saved

---------03:24----------
DC power jack when I say MagSafe DC

---------03:26----------
power jack that means this thing the

---------03:28----------
charger is going to talk to the rest of

---------03:32----------
the machine so the charger on this

---------03:34----------
signal line is gonna put out adaptor

---------03:36----------
sense and that's going to go to this ICU

---------03:39----------
6900 from here we see xed that stands

---------03:43----------
for external as in the charger now it

---------03:45----------
has another tab called int which is

---------03:46----------
going to stand for internal and this is

---------03:48----------
where I see that it's really useful to

---------03:49----------
be a detective because you have to you

---------03:51----------
have to be willing to guess what some of

---------03:53----------
these things mean and just kind of try

---------03:55----------
to look at what's going on around in the

---------03:58----------
area and just put it in a context then

---------04:01----------
we see assists 1 wire now sis 1 wire is

---------04:04----------
going to go to something called the SMC

---------04:07----------
of this chip over here that it's going

---------04:08----------
to is you 4,900 this is an SMC chip see

---------04:14----------
over here SMC it's going to the SMC chip

---------04:19----------
now this circuit over here this chip is

---------04:23----------
gets power on its VCC pin think about

---------04:26----------
this what's going to allow this chip to

---------04:27----------
turn on next is an external signal line

---------04:29----------
int is an internal signal line and C not

---------04:32----------
connected ground zero volts which by

---------04:34----------
process of elimination

---------04:35----------
to pin one as the pin that it is going

---------04:38----------
to receive power from now that power is

---------04:40----------
going to come from this chip this chip

---------04:42----------
very simple if you have power on a and B

---------04:44----------
it shoots out a signal on Y that is

---------04:46----------
gonna be three point 42 volts this is

---------04:49----------
the power this is the pin that provides

---------04:51----------
this chip with the power it needs to

---------04:52----------
turn on if you don't know what any other

---------04:53----------
pins mean you can always Google this and

---------04:55----------
if you google this little number you'll

---------04:57----------
find the datasheet on this chip where it

---------04:59----------
tells you it receives power on pin five

---------05:01----------
and if a and B are present it gives you

---------05:03----------
Y now the power that this trip is gonna

---------05:05----------
need to turn on comes from here the

---------05:07----------
power this chip needs to the car turn on

---------05:08----------
comes from pp3 before - so without PP 3

---------05:11----------
before to present we would not have a

---------05:13----------
light which means I if any time I see

---------05:15----------
that I can skip over PP 3 v 4 - I know

---------05:18----------
it's there it has to be there now one

---------05:22----------
thing I noticed while I was yammering

---------05:24----------
and yabbering and talking on and on and

---------05:26----------
on is that the board itself while it was

---------05:27----------
plugged in actually got hot now this is

---------05:31----------
something that is going to come in handy

---------05:33----------
one of the things that you may notice on

---------05:36----------
these rails is that all some of them are

---------05:37----------
suffixed with s5 or s3 and in some cases

---------05:42----------
over here s oh let's talk about for that

---------05:45----------
what those mean for a second just in

---------05:46----------
case you're somebody is new to the show

---------05:48----------
doesn't know what those mean s5 is gonna

---------05:50----------
be your pal rail that's on any time the

---------05:52----------
computer is off s3 is gonna be a power

---------05:55----------
rail that's on while the computer is

---------05:56----------
sleeping as oh is going to be a power

---------05:58----------
rail that's present when the computer is

---------06:00----------
on as I said before there are certain

---------06:02----------
rails that you're going to want to have

---------06:03----------
on when the computer is sleeping but not

---------06:05----------
have on when the computer is off or on

---------06:08----------
and anything like that so for example

---------06:10----------
the backlight you may want your RAM to

---------06:12----------
have power while the computer is

---------06:14----------
sleeping so that it remembers everything

---------06:16----------
in memory however you're probably not

---------06:19----------
gonna want the computer's backlight to

---------06:20----------
be turned on so the backlight is an

---------06:22----------
example of an Esso power rail memory may

---------06:25----------
be an example of an s3 power rail and

---------06:28----------
the CPU is going to be an example or the

---------06:30----------
graphics chip will be an example of an

---------06:31----------
Esso power rail the only time we're

---------06:33----------
gonna want the CPU or the GPU to be on

---------06:35----------
when the computer is on so what I'm

---------06:38----------
gonna want to see at this point is if

---------06:39----------
the machine is making its way to an Esso

---------06:41----------
state the reason that this interests me

---------06:43----------
is if the machine is in an Esso State I

---------06:46----------
know that all the s3 and the s5 rails

---------06:48----------
are present

---------06:49----------
if the machine is in an s3 state I know

---------06:51----------
the s5 rules are present in order to get

---------06:53----------
to a higher state all the power rails

---------06:55----------
from the lower state have to be

---------06:57----------
available so I cannot make my way to an

---------06:59----------
Esso state with missing s3 rails I can't

---------07:02----------
make my way to an s3 state with missing

---------07:04----------
s5 rails and allow me to demonstrate how

---------07:06----------
this is the case with some of the stuff

---------07:09----------
here so let's find them let's find some

---------07:12----------
some switches yeah to show you so here's

---------07:16----------
an example over here 5 volt s0 FET now

---------07:20----------
over here this is a transistor in the

---------07:22----------
idea behind a transistor is that when

---------07:24----------
you had on this transistor the specific

---------07:26----------
type of transistor when the power on the

---------07:28----------
gate is lower than the power on the

---------07:30----------
source it will let voltage flow from

---------07:32----------
here to here so this is pretty much like

---------07:34----------
a light switch that you can control with

---------07:35----------
electricity rather than flipping a

---------07:37----------
switch

---------07:37----------
you have PP 5 vs 3 on the source input

---------07:40----------
and PP 5 es o on output now the whole

---------07:44----------
idea here is that if I don't have PP 5

---------07:47----------
vs 3 I cannot get PP 5 ESO there's not a

---------07:50----------
said there is no there's not two

---------07:52----------
separate sets of devices creating PP 5

---------07:54----------
es 3 and PP 5 ESO there's one device

---------07:57----------
that creates 5 volts here's 5 volts and

---------08:00----------
then you have these little switching

---------08:02----------
transistors that decide when that 5 volt

---------08:05----------
should go to these components vs. those

---------08:06----------
components that's a switch that's going

---------08:08----------
to take PP 5 es 3 a power line that's 5

---------08:11----------
volts in an s3 State and it's going to

---------08:13----------
send it to the components that require s

---------08:15----------
o whenever you tell it to so the CPU and

---------08:18----------
so on so forth as you can see from the

---------08:20----------
diagram a lot of the different power

---------08:22----------
rails are like that so I can't get

---------08:23----------
myself to an Esso state if I'm not in s3

---------08:26----------
state because the s O power rails are

---------08:28----------
created from the s3 the s4 in the s5

---------08:30----------
rails so what I'm gonna do right now is

---------08:32----------
I'm gonna check to see if I'm in an Esso

---------08:34----------
state meaning I'm gonna check and see if

---------08:35----------
an Esso power L is present if I have my

---------08:38----------
s o rail that means two things the first

---------08:41----------
thing it means is that I that the

---------08:42----------
computer is getting itself to the point

---------08:44----------
that it's turning on it is turning on I

---------08:45----------
am in an Esso state the second thing

---------08:48----------
that it's gonna mean a finesse over L is

---------08:50----------
present is that everything before it has

---------08:51----------
to be present - 3 s are present - 5 s

---------08:54----------
are present my G 3 hearts are present

---------08:55----------
which means I can cross those off the

---------08:57----------
list of checking and if I can cross

---------08:58----------
those off the list that makes the

---------09:00----------
troubleshooting process that much easier

---------09:02----------
this is where

---------09:02----------
talking about sequence is going to save

---------09:05----------
you a lot of time hassle and misery so

---------09:07----------
if I go through this list over here

---------09:08----------
you'll see I have g3 ha trail g3 hot

---------09:12----------
means beyond all the time

---------09:13----------
s5 rail beyond when the machines off as

---------09:17----------
three I can ignore all those rails and

---------09:19----------
the only ones I'll have to check or the

---------09:21----------
Sol ones so I'm gonna check a rail

---------09:22----------
that's pretty easy to check PP 5 ESL

---------09:25----------
when I say easy to check I mean easy to

---------09:27----------
check because I know exactly where it is

---------09:28----------
on every board on all these boards the

---------09:30----------
on a fan connector on the pin to the

---------09:33----------
left that's always going to be PP 5 ESO

---------09:35----------
since these machines I'll use compatible

---------09:37----------
fans I know that it's always the same

---------09:38----------
one so if I have 5 volts there did I

---------09:42----------
plug this in right of course you didn't

---------09:44----------
so if I have 5 volts here there we go

---------09:48----------
I'm in an Esso state so what I've done

---------09:50----------
is I've now ruled out every single s 3 s

---------09:52----------
5 ng 3 hot well that means I don't have

---------09:55----------
to check those rails which means that I

---------09:57----------
can go ahead and only check as oh where

---------09:59----------
else to find the one that's missing so

---------10:01----------
PP 5 ESO is present BAM now I can go

---------10:04----------
through here and I can say ok I need to

---------10:06----------
check PP 3 B 3 s o PP 1 v 8 s o CP UV

---------10:12----------
core P P 1 vo 5 s o V P 1 V 2 s o and

---------10:17----------
I'm gonna try to find the rail that

---------10:19----------
itself is missing so let's go through

---------10:21----------
this and try to check those other rails

---------10:24----------
so I'm gonna go over here and I'm gonna

---------10:25----------
open this in PP 3 V 3 SL let's check the

---------10:28----------
rest of the rails and see which rail is

---------10:30----------
missing but now see I've saved myself a

---------10:32----------
lot of times a lot of rails that I don't

---------10:34----------
have to check because most of the hard

---------10:37----------
work has already been done it's the way

---------10:40----------
to minimize troubleshooting number one

---------10:42----------
of the things that's key to making this

---------10:44----------
economically viable to do as a service

---------10:47----------
for retail customers is coming up with

---------10:50----------
ways to make the troubleshooting process

---------10:52----------
a little bit quicker now we're gonna do

---------10:54----------
this and three point close enough I

---------10:58----------
haven't changed the multimeter batteries

---------10:59----------
in two years so if it's off by a little

---------11:00----------
bit that's just fine now we're gonna go

---------11:03----------
over to the next rail which is going to

---------11:05----------
be C we have pp 1 v8s o pp 1 v8

---------11:13----------
underscore s Oh

---------11:15----------
and we have but I'm supposed to get 1.8

---------11:18----------
there I'm guessing 1.78 again close

---------11:21----------
enough but multimeter batteries haven't

---------11:23----------
been changed in quite a bit of time and

---------11:25----------
we're gonna check another rail we're

---------11:28----------
gonna check PP 1 v5 s 3 RSO not sure if

---------11:32----------
that's that's 3r s Oh what is this three

---------11:34----------
RS oh oh there oh no no it's on I've

---------11:38----------
that's something to look up later I'm

---------11:41----------
gonna check you and your present on the

---------11:47----------
other side of the board that's fine it's

---------11:48----------
fine we'll still fine you you don't get

---------11:50----------
to hide from me that is 1.49

---------11:58----------
again close enough and since it's close

---------12:00----------
enough as a reward myself with a little

---------12:03----------
drink

---------12:10----------
all right so we continue down the list

---------12:12----------
of rails here PP 0 v 5s OD d

---------12:18----------
tongue-twister a lot of these are tongue

---------12:21----------
twisters okay we're gonna measure this

---------12:24----------
rail over here what a tongue twister

---------12:31----------
love to meet the people who came up with

---------12:33----------
these names okay now is hmm am I looking

---------12:42----------
at the right thing here no I'm not here

---------12:45----------
we go

---------12:48----------
8 7 1 close enough to 0.75 I really

---------12:52----------
should replace the batteries in the damn

---------12:53----------
multimeter I never turn this thing off

---------12:57----------
properly and it's I really haven't

---------12:59----------
replaced those batteries and like 2

---------13:00----------
years I should be ashamed of myself so P

---------13:03----------
P 1 v 5s Oh is next

---------13:13----------
each time I go to the doctor they go do

---------13:15----------
you drink cuz last one to the doctor I

---------13:17----------
hadn't drank at home year about a year

---------13:20----------
do you drink

---------13:22----------
no recreationally next time they do that

---------13:27----------
I'm gonna go do when they go do you Jane

---------13:29----------
do you drink no recreationally no

---------13:33----------
professionally I drink professionally

---------13:38----------
0.004 that sound like 1.5 volts to you

---------13:42----------
let's analyze that section let's analyze

---------13:44----------
what's going to create P p1 v5

---------13:46----------
underscore s oh so if we were to analyze

---------13:49----------
what creates P p1 v 5s oh we will find

---------13:53----------
our way to come on that's something

---------13:59----------
that's powered by P p1 v 5s oh I'm

---------14:01----------
looking for where it's created you got

---------14:03----------
to find that so we find our way here we

---------14:07----------
go see the reason I know that this is

---------14:08----------
where it's created is this is output

---------14:10----------
everywhere else P P 185's I was going in

---------14:12----------
or something but here it's at the end of

---------14:14----------
a circuit and I'm correct 1.5 volt s oo

---------14:17----------
regulator this is a pretty basic circuit

---------14:20----------
effects so we have P P 3 B 3 s 3 which

---------14:23----------
we know is present because we have P P 3

---------14:24----------
V 3 s Oh going to voltage n that's going

---------14:27----------
into the chip to power then we also have

---------14:29----------
P P 3 V 3 s Oh enable on pin 2 so this

---------14:34----------
is this this is very simple if P P 3 V 3

---------14:36----------
s o is present as a rail as long as P P

---------14:38----------
3 P 3 s o is present meaning we're in an

---------14:40----------
s3 state then turn on this chip so pin 2

---------14:43----------
is enable so here's what I'm gonna be

---------14:45----------
interested in here do I have power on

---------14:48----------
pin 2 and 1 if I voltage on pin 1 that

---------14:51----------
chip is receiving power it needs to work

---------14:53----------
if I'm getting power on pin 2 that means

---------14:54----------
it's being told to work so there's a

---------14:56----------
difference between receiving the power

---------14:58----------
you need to turn on and being told to

---------15:00----------
work so to give you an example with

---------15:02----------
something let's see if I have any damn

---------15:05----------
cord that's long enough all right so

---------15:06----------
this is my microscope camera right now

---------15:10----------
this is me giving it power on the VN pin

---------15:12----------
this is me giving a power on the VCC or

---------15:14----------
the VN pin I'm gonna take my adapter

---------15:16----------
with power and plug it in however it's

---------15:18----------
not being told to work it has power if I

---------15:21----------
want to use it but to actually use it I

---------15:23----------
have to do this I have to switch over to

---------15:25----------
the microscope camera

---------15:26----------
and then when I switch into the

---------15:27----------
microscope camera you'll be able to see

---------15:29----------
whatever I put under the microscope

---------15:31----------
camera look it's a little deer it's a

---------15:36----------
deer with a cross above his head

---------15:47----------
doesn't feel like 31% they represent

---------15:49----------
alcohol by volume that's the way that

---------15:53----------
works so we were to continue along here

---------16:02----------
I'm interested in what's on pin 1 and

---------16:04----------
pin 2 and I'm also interested in seeing

---------16:07----------
whether or not these feedback resistors

---------16:10----------
are broken the thing is a feedback was

---------16:11----------
missing we would see a low amount but I

---------16:13----------
don't think we would see nothing so I'm

---------16:15----------
not quite about to blame those just yet

---------16:16----------
but you never know so let's just do a

---------16:18----------
little bit of investigating we're gonna

---------16:19----------
find you 77 10 is gonna be is l8 0 0 9

---------16:23----------
let's try to find you 77 10 and see

---------16:26----------
what's going on in that area you 7 7 10

---------16:29----------
is right here let's take a look at an

---------16:31----------
area into the microscope and see if we

---------16:32----------
see anything that's particularly

---------16:33----------
interesting maybe we'll see another deer

---------16:35----------
you never know you never never know so

---------16:40----------
we're gonna browse over to that area and

---------16:45----------
oh seems like I'm not the first person

---------16:51----------
to be here that transistor on the left

---------16:54----------
is on a little bit crooked and yeah that

---------16:58----------
does not look like the original hmm

---------17:02----------
seems like somebody's been here first

---------17:06----------
I hate when somebody beats me to it but

---------17:09----------
it looks like somebody did indeed beat

---------17:11----------
me to it so we're gonna just measure

---------17:12----------
some of the things that I said we're

---------17:13----------
interested in over here which is gonna

---------17:14----------
be the voltage on pins 1 & 2 or

---------17:17----------
interested in both enable voltage and

---------17:19----------
also voltage in so let's take a look and

---------17:21----------
see what we have on voltage in and also

---------17:23----------
enable do keep in mind we need both of

---------17:25----------
these in order for anything to actually

---------17:26----------
function now let's see if I can get

---------17:28----------
these in camera can I get this in camera

---------17:31----------
yeah maybe kind of sort of maybe gotta

---------17:35----------
move the keyboard up do this and I know

---------17:40----------
yeah we go alright so pin 1 it's gonna

---------17:45----------
be power

---------17:50----------
3.3 volts and pin2 is going to be

---------17:53----------
enabled and we got both so we have

---------17:55----------
enable and we have power going into the

---------17:56----------
chip but it's not creating output now it

---------17:59----------
could be a feedback resist a problem or

---------18:00----------
it could be an actual chip problem and

---------18:03----------
I'm kind of inclined in this case to

---------18:04----------
blame it on the chip why because it

---------18:06----------
looks like it's been screwed with and

---------18:08----------
that that just that just tells me

---------18:10----------
everything so let's take a look here and

---------18:12----------
get ourselves another chip so I'm gonna

---------18:15----------
get myself another one of these chips

---------18:17----------
are gonna replace that we're gonna see

---------18:18----------
if that fixes our problem all right so

---------18:20----------
we got ourselves a replacement chip now

---------18:21----------
it's just time to turn on the fume

---------18:23----------
extractor turn on the soldering

---------18:25----------
equipment and let's get to work as

---------18:26----------
always if you're doing any of this type

---------18:27----------
of work you should be working with a

---------18:29----------
[Music]

---------18:34----------
with an iron that isn't annoying as hell

---------18:37----------
[Music]

---------18:39----------
the tip wasn't all the way in always

---------18:42----------
remember to insert your tip all the way

---------18:44----------
in

---------18:54----------
as always you should always be working

---------18:55----------
with a fume extractor you don't want to

---------18:57----------
breathe any of the shin and let's get to

---------19:04----------
work

---------19:04----------
so first thing we have to do is remove

---------19:06----------
this chip it's gonna require a little

---------19:07----------
bit of hot air now just to make it come

---------19:09----------
off just a little bit easier less heat

---------19:10----------
in the board we're gonna use some flux

---------19:12----------
over here just put some flux around this

---------19:14----------
IC itself and we're going to put my

---------19:17----------
nozzle on the JBC and remove this chip

---------19:20----------
from the board we do want to be careful

---------19:22----------
about heating the PCH because the PCH is

---------19:24----------
right next door to this chip as you can

---------19:26----------
see this over here is the chip that we

---------19:27----------
do not want to heat we do not want to

---------19:29----------
heat that yet it is right next to this

---------19:31----------
which can require some careful precision

---------19:34----------
so just gonna lower the air on the hot

---------19:36----------
air station and let's go in the first

---------19:40----------
thing we want to do just make this

---------19:41----------
process a little bit easier is preheat

---------19:43----------
the board soap reading the board is

---------19:45----------
gonna be an important aspect here we

---------19:46----------
want to preheat it the whole idea being

---------19:47----------
that we don't want to burn and boil the

---------19:51----------
chip and boil the first layer while the

---------19:53----------
rest of the layer is good man so it's

---------20:00----------
gonna preheat from a little farther away

---------20:02----------
before we move in on the board and I

---------20:04----------
would say we give them about 30 seconds

---------20:06----------
of that now you could easily go out

---------20:08----------
there and burn by a board pre heater you

---------20:10----------
could have a board pre heater do this

---------20:11----------
for you or if you're like me you can

---------20:13----------
simply heat the board from far away with

---------20:15----------
a hot air station for a little while

---------20:16----------
before you go in directly on the chip to

---------20:18----------
remove it it's up to you it is up to

---------20:20----------
personal preference what it is you want

---------20:22----------
to do and as always you should use what

---------20:24----------
works for you and allows you to get

---------20:26----------
things done quickly and efficiently I

---------20:28----------
personally find I don't want a pre

---------20:29----------
heater on my desk because I have a

---------20:30----------
tendency to never be honest today I have

---------20:33----------
a tendency to burn myself on it cuz I

---------20:34----------
forget it's there all the time and then

---------20:35----------
I just wind up cursing over and over

---------20:37----------
again so I tend to not use a pre heater

---------20:39----------
I just simply tend to preheat the board

---------20:40----------
for far away and then move in when I'm

---------20:43----------
close to the temperature I want to be

---------20:45----------
now the reason I'm doing the preheating

---------20:48----------
is let's say the board is 25 Celsius and

---------20:50----------
I need this to be 217 Celsius to melt if

---------20:53----------
I heat the board at 217 the board is

---------20:56----------
gonna constantly be absorbing the heat

---------20:58----------
away from the solder joints so I'm

---------21:00----------
probably gonna be at 100 or 150 Celsius

---------21:02----------
not 217 which means I got to raise the

---------21:04----------
temperature of the hot air at a for 300

---------21:06----------
or 400 or 500

---------21:07----------
so now I'm gonna be burning the chip to

---------21:09----------
get this the tooth to be burning the

---------21:12----------
chip to get the solder pads to 217

---------21:15----------
because the board is constantly

---------21:16----------
absorbing the heat so if the board

---------21:17----------
itself is saturated with heat to the

---------21:19----------
point where it cannot absorb more at a

---------21:21----------
lower temperature like 200 Celsius or

---------21:23----------
150 Celsius I don't have to use as much

---------21:26----------
heat to actually remove the chip or do

---------21:28----------
my soldering rework so you watch how

---------21:30----------
quick that's gonna come off after

---------21:31----------
preheating see that that's the power of

---------21:33----------
a preheated board now we're gonna do

---------21:35----------
this gonna clean up some of that solder

---------21:36----------
there cuz I'm not quite sure what

---------21:37----------
somebody did it looks like there was

---------21:39----------
worked on there before it looks like I

---------21:40----------
am not the first person to be here on

---------21:42----------
this board looks like I'm not the first

---------21:43----------
person to be replacing this chip perhaps

---------21:45----------
it failed because it was just it's time

---------21:47----------
to fail or perhaps it failed because it

---------21:50----------
was you know is heated too much or who

---------21:53----------
knows it did maybe it just fell because

---------21:54----------
it's it's it's something that's made by

---------21:56----------
Apple again you never you never know

---------22:00----------
let's just start from scratch here we're

---------22:02----------
just gonna wick away that old sod are we

---------22:04----------
gonna add our own solder in there and

---------22:05----------
solder in a nice and a chip there's a

---------22:09----------
nice happy nerd ship and a happy new pp1

---------22:12----------
v5s oh circuit or a happy board

---------22:17----------
everybody's happy happy happy happy

---------22:21----------
happy happy

---------22:26----------
happy deer that deer looks pretty happy

---------22:56----------
would be best to phase the micro pencil

---------22:58----------
for this but I think the micro pencil is

---------23:00----------
hiding on Jason's desk so I'll make this

---------23:03----------
work

---------23:08----------
this is a very very crowded area to be

---------23:10----------
using this now I'm to the center pad we

---------23:12----------
don't want too much solder on so I'm not

---------23:13----------
even gonna add a new solder to my iron

---------23:15----------
I'm just gonna use what's already there

---------23:17----------
okay now we're scent so what comes up

---------23:19----------
next is going to be getting a chip to

---------23:22----------
put on the board over here and we'll be

---------23:24----------
set so let's get ourselves a chip

---------23:35----------
I'm gonna get myself a chip

---------23:44----------
move the air filter over this over we're

---------23:48----------
gonna preheat a board the reason I don't

---------23:50----------
put this under the microscope is because

---------23:52----------
I don't want to have to put the chip

---------23:53----------
down when I'm done I don't want to put

---------23:56----------
the chip down on the desk because it

---------23:57----------
will disappear so I always keep the

---------23:58----------
board that I'm working on under the

---------24:00----------
microscope

---------24:20----------
come on

---------24:22----------
if I go to Mouser to buy this I find

---------24:24----------
chips that are similar to this but not

---------24:26----------
quite exactly the same so what are you

---------24:33----------
gonna do

---------24:49----------
now we need a lower temperature than

---------24:51----------
usual to actually solder a good one on

---------24:54----------
there I'll explain why in a second

---------25:07----------
since now I can only guess what happened

---------25:12----------
based on this thing drives me nuts and I

---------25:17----------
can only guess what happened based on

---------25:18----------
the hints and what I see here it looks

---------25:21----------
like that has been replaced before so

---------25:24----------
what I'm guessing is that the one that

---------25:26----------
was replaced failed and there are I can

---------25:30----------
only I can't I know it can't know

---------25:32----------
exactly why but I have to keep in mind

---------25:34----------
that maybe the chip is just very

---------25:35----------
sensitive to heat so perhaps when the

---------25:37----------
first individual replaced that chip they

---------25:39----------
use a little bit too much heat I yeah I

---------25:41----------
can only guess right

---------25:42----------
I can only only guess I don't know if

---------25:47----------
that's right but it doesn't hurt to

---------25:49----------
think about it so I'm gonna preheat from

---------25:50----------
far away same as before we're gonna

---------25:52----------
preheat our chip nice and gentle with it

---------25:54----------
take our time I don't care if it's

---------25:56----------
perfectly aligned just yet because we're

---------25:57----------
not in the stage of one an asado

---------25:58----------
directly on the board I'm just in the

---------26:00----------
stage of getting the board to be nice

---------26:02----------
and warm not hot just nice and warm

---------26:07----------
get the board to a nine hundred fifty

---------26:09----------
two hundred Celsius

---------26:10----------
not not hot just kind a little bit warm

---------26:12----------
you know some some comfortable

---------26:16----------
vacationing temperature

---------26:31----------
now eventually the flux is gonna kind of

---------26:33----------
blow itself away and once the flux has

---------26:35----------
blown itself away I'll go in closer on

---------26:37----------
the chip the flux is gonna kind of be in

---------26:39----------
my way of telling what the temperature

---------26:41----------
of the area is okay push down beautiful

---------26:53----------
got ourselves a nice happy little chip

---------26:55----------
and we're gonna wait for this to beep

---------27:04----------
beep beep beep very good good little

---------27:13----------
hackle

---------27:15----------
take minimal time touching up the joints

---------27:23----------
blow away some excess flux and while

---------27:27----------
it's still hot that is the time to clean

---------27:28----------
it again we usually do ultrasonic these

---------27:30----------
boards when we're done with them but

---------27:31----------
just for the mean time it's easy it's

---------27:33----------
best to get off as much flux as you can

---------27:34----------
while it's still hot so I'm just gonna

---------27:36----------
fight with the alcohol dispenser a

---------27:37----------
little as you can probably hear in the

---------27:38----------
background when I'm done fighting with

---------27:39----------
the alcohol dispenser will remove as

---------27:41----------
much as we can while it's still hot

---------27:43----------
again you can rub this in the ultrasonic

---------27:44----------
cleaner the ultrasonic cleaner does heat

---------27:46----------
up but the ultrasonic cleaner heats up

---------27:48----------
to you know eighty Celsius if you can

---------27:51----------
remove this stuff while the board is

---------27:52----------
still at 150 or 200 Celsius it makes the

---------27:55----------
job a lot easier for the ultrasonic

---------27:56----------
cleaner so we've done that now we're

---------28:00----------
gonna see if we actually fixed our

---------28:01----------
problem so the first thing I'm gonna do

---------28:02----------
is just let that area of the board cool

---------28:05----------
off a little bit and it's gonna continue

---------28:06----------
going over it with some nice cold

---------28:08----------
alcohol because we did spend some time

---------28:10----------
preheating it so the cold alcohol is

---------28:13----------
gonna be a nice way to not just clean

---------28:14----------
the board but also cool it off in the

---------28:16----------
alcohol as you can see is evaporating

---------28:18----------
very quickly

---------28:18----------
it's a 99% alcohol and also this board

---------28:21----------
is still bit warm

---------28:23----------
this is gonna cool off the board nicely

---------28:25----------
and then after that we're gonna turn try

---------28:26----------
turning it on and I'm going to turn it

---------28:28----------
on while it's in the microscope so that

---------28:30----------
you can actually see whether or not it

---------28:32----------
blows up again so let's just plug this

---------28:34----------
in and see if the chip actually blows up

---------28:37----------
on camera that would be pretty

---------28:38----------
interesting I think it doesn't blow up

---------28:44----------
but what's more interesting here as you

---------28:47----------
can see that we have a fan spinning well

---------28:51----------
you don't believe me with the microscope

---------28:52----------
picture as you can see here look oh you

---------28:56----------
hear that fan spinning it's beautiful

---------28:59----------
now let's see did that hmm beautiful so

---------29:07----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------29:09----------
you learned something and do come back

---------29:11----------
tomorrow for another episode of

---------29:12----------
component-level board repair
