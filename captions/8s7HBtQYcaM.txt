---------00:00----------
I'm guessing it's

---------00:05----------
hey everybody how's it going here we

---------00:08----------
have an a 1502 MacBook is not powering

---------00:10----------
on that's d coronis MacBook open it up

---------00:12----------
see if we can make it work again and

---------00:14----------
figure out why it's not powering on

---------00:15----------
first thing we do is spray it with

---------00:18----------
Corona

---------00:18----------
I mean anti Corona spray yeah we are

---------00:20----------
desperate of course I don't have Corona

---------00:22----------
in a bottle

---------00:23----------
I'm not producing Corona in a bottle man

---------00:27----------
this MacBook is really dirty these are

---------00:29----------
the types of Mac books that Corona comes

---------00:31----------
out of ok so here we have a 1502 MacBook

---------00:49----------
is an 8 to 0:34 76 board see how many

---------00:53----------
amps it takes 126 milliamps

---------01:00----------
I'm guessing it's

---------01:05----------
all of us power good issue let's see

---------01:09----------
take the board out of the case and see

---------01:11----------
what's going on with it

---------01:12----------
I bet corrosion by all says power good

---------01:14----------
transistor what do you all think oh this

---------01:21----------
needs us damn Phillips that I don't have

---------01:22----------
here I stole it from Kevin Eric I needs

---------01:27----------
to replace your keyboard so that I can

---------01:28----------
bring this back my films back

---------01:40----------
hmm what was i huh getting started on

---------01:43----------
the board

---------01:49----------
that's

---------01:58----------
okay beefy brush g3 hot is 1.5 volts do

---------02:03----------
we have a short to ground on the PP bus

---------02:04----------
perhaps that's what's causing this wait

---------02:08----------
a second twelve point fifty seven volts

---------02:10----------
on PV bus here

---------02:11----------
so there's twelve point fifty seven

---------02:13----------
volts on PP bus g3 hot on that side of

---------02:15----------
the board ah now twelve on the side of

---------02:19----------
the board interesting and now we're down

---------02:21----------
to 32 milliamps very strange because

---------02:23----------
before was taking about a hundred what

---------02:26----------
the hell is going on here what bump

---------02:29----------
[ __ ] is this okay let's go through

---------02:32----------
our list PP vide RTC g3 Hut three point

---------02:37----------
three volts 55 vs 5 5 volts PP 5 vs 0

---------02:48----------
volts hmm SMC zombie cuz we got 12.5

---------02:56----------
here you ho ha ha

---------03:03----------
I see it can any of you see it

---------03:17----------
p.m. sleep gtfo bye say hello to this

---------03:23----------
board p.m. sleep s4l you're coming back

---------04:03----------
I'm going to check and see what that cap

---------04:04----------
was for in a moment so in front of us is

---------04:08----------
an eight to zero thirty four seventy six

---------04:10----------
or eight to zero thirty-five thirty-six

---------04:12----------
same schematic doesn't make a difference

---------04:14----------
another thirty four seventy six is a bit

---------04:19----------
more difficult to schematic to come by

---------04:22----------
that's a cap on PB v ESL

---------04:37----------
yeah this isn't scraping

---------04:41----------
try to bring this pad back here

---------04:48----------
the pad is gone so there's not really

---------04:50----------
much I can do in terms of bringing the

---------04:52----------
pad back so I'm probably going to find a

---------04:54----------
way to solder to the trace after I rip

---------04:56----------
the Annett the enamel off of the trace

---------05:00----------
here

---------05:59----------
so that cap is gonna go from being a

---------06:02----------
horizontal cap to a vertical cap minor

---------06:06----------
remodel it's gonna do a little bit of

---------06:08----------
remodeling here some Eugene Eugene

---------06:13----------
Eugene

---------07:55----------
okay 33 milliamp we haven't changed

---------07:59----------
anything here so now I'm gonna have to

---------08:03----------
entertain the possibility that there's

---------08:04----------
still a short circuit on that rail wait

---------08:16----------
that's the ground side isn't it yeah 17

---------08:19----------
come home

---------08:21----------
so this chip is for CPU Vico oh god no

---------08:24----------
oh

---------08:27----------
womp-womp cpu vcore this means my cpu

---------08:38----------
got 5 volts but you know my CPU got 12

---------08:43----------
volts because this chip is controlling

---------08:45----------
these changes that's in travels to the

---------08:47----------
CPU all right so we're probably gonna

---------08:54----------
find some more liquid here

---------09:14----------
at least 12 volts is better than 15.6 I

---------09:22----------
should probably drink some water

---------09:24----------
actually yeah I'm the worst at social

---------09:29----------
media I don't have a Twitter I don't

---------09:31----------
have a Facebook I don't have an

---------09:33----------
Instagram I don't have a LinkedIn the

---------09:37----------
only place you could find me is here and

---------09:42----------
I recently stopped reading my comments

---------09:44----------
for the good of my sanity hmm I really

---------09:50----------
don't want to believe that p.m. sleep

---------09:52----------
s4l is still missing I kind of wanted to

---------09:54----------
believe that once I fixed this that

---------09:55----------
would be it I don't want to believe it

---------09:57----------
this sucks oh I just wiggled the charger

---------10:03----------
in about 200 milliamps hoho

---------10:05----------
are you serious I just all I did is

---------10:09----------
wiggle the charger and I'm at 290 Mel

---------10:10----------
laughs okay let's see is pp best present

---------10:16----------
hmm okay maybe it's getting into an Esso

---------10:20----------
state but not staying there because that

---------10:22----------
katrina thing to control the transistor

---------10:24----------
is damaged maybe that's what's going on

---------10:25----------
here

---------10:33----------
wait a second five volts is not going to

---------10:35----------
the chip because they ripped off the pad

---------10:38----------
oh you dumb [ __ ] I'm a [ __ ]

---------10:43----------
[ __ ] how did I not notice that Oh son

---------10:51----------
of a [ __ ] son of a [ __ ]

---------11:05----------
whoa that was really stupid see look

---------11:18----------
this is 5 PP 5 ESL it's coming down here

---------11:21----------
the pad was corroded so I scraped it but

---------11:24----------
without realizing that it's not that PP

---------11:26----------
5 vs I was going from here up there it's

---------11:29----------
going from up there and it down here how

---------11:32----------
is the chip supposed to get any power of

---------11:34----------
course it's not gonna turn on CPU V core

---------11:37----------
is not gonna be present because the chip

---------11:38----------
that is controlling the 5 the the

---------11:42----------
transistor that sends PP brush D through

---------11:44----------
Neha it's pulses to the CPU to give the

---------11:47----------
CPU one point 7 volts of CPU v core

---------11:49----------
didn't have any power to turn on of

---------11:51----------
course it's not gonna turn on Wow that's

---------11:54----------
total smooth brain moment I feel like a

---------11:57----------
koala that's trying to figure out what

---------11:59----------
to eat but the leaf is on the ground

---------12:02----------
rather than in the tree so he just kind

---------12:04----------
of cries and sits there until he starves

---------12:06----------
to death because he's too stupid to tell

---------12:07----------
then you could oMG man if I can fix max

---------12:16----------
I'm telling you I can fix a MacBook

---------12:18----------
anybody can

---------12:25----------
there's no excuse for geniuses to be

---------12:27----------
this incompetent yeah that's the sad

---------12:31----------
part - that's the really sad part it's

---------12:34----------
not like it's not like apples or pear

---------12:36----------
business model looks bad in contrast to

---------12:40----------
you know the Society of Engineers ie

---------12:44----------
you know Union electricians or some [ __ ]

---------12:49----------
dumbass that cuts a trace to a chip

---------12:52----------
that's needed for it to turn on doesn't

---------12:53----------
put it back on and then wonders why the

---------12:55----------
computer's not turning on the bar is not

---------12:58----------
high here the bar is not high yet Apple

---------13:03----------
still can't get it all right so we got a

---------13:06----------
nice little jumper wire in place that's

---------13:08----------
some enamel jumper wire I'll replace the

---------13:14----------
chip as well I'm not gonna reuse the old

---------13:16----------
one I shouldn't even be thinking about

---------13:19----------
reusing the old one

---------14:04----------
this seriously a cap under that there

---------14:08----------
was a freaking capacitor under there or

---------14:10----------
a piece of something what the hell

---------14:18----------
well there was a piece of molten junk

---------14:22----------
under there that wasn't melting

---------14:24----------
interesting

---------14:50----------
and then lower that wire a little bit so

---------14:56----------
he doesn't stick out stick up

---------15:02----------
get rid of the edge piece give it a sec

---------15:07----------
to cool down using rapid cool technology

---------15:14----------
this is a rapid cool technology my theme

---------15:17----------
extractor all right give me five hundred

---------15:26----------
fifty mil amps 550ml amps 550ml amps

---------15:33----------
haha again fixed fan spin alright let's

---------15:41----------
go over what was going on with this

---------15:42----------
machine so he had liquid damage on this

---------15:45----------
cap between PP 5 ESO and this chip now

---------15:48----------
there's a chance that that was shorting

---------15:49----------
it to ground but also this connection

---------15:51----------
being corroded here the cap was really a

---------15:53----------
red herring the cap most likely wasn't

---------15:55----------
my problem the problem is that the path

---------15:57----------
between PP 5 ESO and here was broken

---------16:00----------
this is a phase for CPU v core what do I

---------16:03----------
mean by phase great question if you zoom

---------16:05----------
out this over here is a control or chip

---------16:09----------
this is going to control these

---------16:11----------
transistors which are sending 12 volts

---------16:14----------
to the CPU so here is the output PPE

---------16:17----------
VCC SOC PU it says 1.85 volts but it's

---------16:21----------
input over here from these transistors

---------16:25----------
these transistors are going to be

---------16:27----------
outputting slices of pp bus s five high

---------16:30----------
side computing and PP bus s5 high sense

---------16:32----------
computing is also known as pp bus g3 hot

---------16:37----------
yeah I'll show you where I find that

---------16:39----------
yeah here we go yeah so pp bus g3 huh

---------16:42----------
goes through a current sense resistor to

---------16:45----------
become this that's why I use the terms

---------16:46----------
interchangeably

---------16:47----------
pbht three house also easier to say than

---------16:49----------
all this crap anyway if we go back to

---------16:51----------
where I was it's acute 7310 area if you

---------16:55----------
take a look what this does is it's going

---------16:58----------
to take slices of 12 volts and turn it

---------17:01----------
into 1.8 so these are transistors a

---------17:04----------
transistor is like a switch except the

---------17:05----------
transistor is a switch that you don't

---------17:07----------
flip with in your finger like a light

---------17:09----------
switch it's a switch that you flip by

---------17:11----------
sending electricity to it so if it sees

---------17:13----------
electricity on its gate it'll let stuff

---------17:16----------
through if it doesn't see electricity on

---------17:17----------
the gate it won't or if it's the

---------17:18----------
opposite type of transistor then it'll

---------17:20----------
work the opposite way but you get the

---------17:21----------
idea it's just a it's like a light

---------17:23----------
switch that is switched electronically

---------17:25----------
now the way a switching power supply is

---------17:27----------
going to work and the way

---------17:28----------
this entire section over here is going

---------17:29----------
to work is it's going to take slices of

---------17:33----------
TP bunch d3 hot which is twelve point

---------17:35----------
five volts cut it up into sections and

---------17:38----------
then send it off and then it's going to

---------17:40----------
get turn at one point eight so the way

---------17:41----------
this works is kind of like averaging so

---------17:43----------
if you have 12 volts and you want to

---------17:45----------
turn it into one volt what you do is you

---------17:47----------
send 12 a little bit of 12 volts then

---------17:49----------
you turn the transistor off and you send

---------17:51----------
a lot of 0 then you send a little bit of

---------17:53----------
12 volts then you send a lot of 0 then

---------17:55----------
you send a little bit of 12 volts then

---------17:56----------
you send a lot of 0 now the CPU is not

---------17:59----------
gonna want to get punched in the face

---------18:00----------
with 12 volts every time because if

---------18:02----------
you're getting like Oh 12 volts Oh 12

---------18:05----------
volts Oh 12 volts your CPU is dead what

---------18:07----------
you want to do is you want to even it

---------18:08----------
out and that's what's gonna happen with

---------18:10----------
this inductor over here so the inductor

---------18:12----------
is going to take all those pulses of 12

---------18:14----------
volts and when you have the inductor

---------18:16----------
over here that's going to smooth it out

---------18:18----------
then you have a bunch of capacitors to

---------18:19----------
ground which are also going to be

---------18:22----------
smoothing this out that's gonna be on

---------18:24----------
another page of the schematic then what

---------18:25----------
you wind up with it's instead of a bunch

---------18:27----------
of ow ow you wind up with a steady 1

---------18:32----------
volt which is just like because like

---------18:35----------
imagine you you're trying to fall asleep

---------18:37----------
in class like you know this you can do

---------18:39----------
steady low pressure rather than no

---------18:45----------
that's that that's the idea so this

---------18:48----------
transistor over here the set of

---------18:50----------
transistors is going to create one phase

---------18:52----------
but since the CPU is going to need a lot

---------18:55----------
of power

---------18:55----------
what you need is multiple phases so over

---------18:59----------
here this is going to be making one

---------19:00----------
point 85 volts but this may not be

---------19:03----------
making it at enough current you may need

---------19:05----------
more current than them so that's why you

---------19:06----------
have this over here this is going to be

---------19:08----------
phase two now on the older machines that

---------19:11----------
I remember the transistors were directly

---------19:13----------
controlled by the CPU v core controller

---------19:15----------
chip so what this chip over here is

---------19:16----------
gonna do is it's going to tell the

---------19:18----------
transistors when to turn on and off but

---------19:20----------
here it seems like you've got this as a

---------19:21----------
middleman so you have this chip which

---------19:23----------
speaks to this chip this chip is the CPU

---------19:25----------
v core controller the is l 9 v 8 to 6

---------19:30----------
that controls this and then this

---------19:33----------
controls that same thing here this chip

---------19:36----------
controls this trip this chip then

---------19:38----------
controls those transistors those

---------19:40----------
transistors send pulses of

---------19:41----------
twelve volts through this way the coil

---------19:43----------
is gonna then average that out and it's

---------19:45----------
gonna wind up being about 1.85 volts and

---------19:47----------
then somewhere down the line there's

---------19:49----------
gonna be a bunch of capacitors yeah if

---------19:51----------
you take a look on the schematic I mean

---------19:53----------
the board view over here you'll see that

---------19:55----------
there's a bunch of little capacitors

---------19:56----------
everywhere and that's gonna smooth it

---------19:58----------
out and you'll get a nice even happy 1.8

---------20:00----------
85 volts now only one of those phases is

---------20:03----------
working not too so the reason I was

---------20:05----------
probably getting two hundred fifty five

---------20:06----------
milliamps hundred twenty mill amps

---------20:08----------
before rather than the whole thing is it

---------20:10----------
actually was turning on but it was only

---------20:12----------
turning on half of its brain kind of

---------20:14----------
like after I got my concussion when I

---------20:16----------
was riding my bike two years ago and I

---------20:17----------
went over that stupid oily great I you

---------20:20----------
know half of my brain was on so I'm

---------20:22----------
still alive I'm still breathing but I

---------20:24----------
had no idea where I was that I went to

---------20:26----------
the gym that day same thing is true here

---------20:28----------
the reason that I was only taking a

---------20:31----------
hundred to 250 milliamps rather than the

---------20:32----------
entire five to six-hundred it because

---------20:34----------
only half of the CPU vcore phase was

---------20:36----------
working but now it's all working and

---------20:38----------
that is my scientific definition for the

---------20:41----------
day I hope you've enjoyed your class

---------20:43----------
with Professor Rossmann that's it for

---------20:44----------
today and as always I hope you learned

---------20:46----------
something I'm gonna take a break get

---------20:47----------
some food shoot my employees at some

---------20:49----------
nerf guns you know cuz why not and I'll

---------20:51----------
see you all in the next video thank you

---------20:53----------
for watching and as always I hope you

---------20:55----------
learned something by now
