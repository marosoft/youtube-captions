---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna go over

---------00:01----------
an eight to zero 3209 that doesn't turn

---------00:03----------
on so today I want to show you how it's

---------00:05----------
really important to know where the

---------00:06----------
original damage occurred so that you

---------00:08----------
could figure out problems that would

---------00:09----------
otherwise be a complete utter nightmare

---------00:12----------
so when you look at the actual machine

---------00:14----------
itself you're gonna see that there are

---------00:16----------
these little marks and they look like

---------00:17----------
pigeon little stains of pigeon that

---------00:20----------
you would see on the sidewalk and if you

---------00:22----------
look at it under the microscope you're

---------00:23----------
gonna see this this is gonna be really

---------00:24----------
helpful if the board is cleaned before

---------00:26----------
you look at it and you have no idea

---------00:27----------
where the original damage occurred so

---------00:29----------
when I look at it under the microscope

---------00:30----------
let's just get in focus so I have some

---------00:32----------
here and that's the pigeon looking

---------00:34----------
stuff that I'm talking about and then a

---------00:36----------
really main one I'm interested in is

---------00:37----------
this one right over here so what I do is

---------00:40----------
I look at the I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

---------00:42----------
look at the motherboard in those spots

---------00:44----------
so again this is a board that was fully

---------00:45----------
cleaned before I got it so I it's great

---------00:48----------
because I don't have to actually waste

---------00:49----------
time ultrasonic again and dealing with

---------00:51----------
all that but the downside is I

---------00:53----------
don't know where the actual problem is

---------00:54----------
and it's gonna take a lot of inspection

---------00:57----------
so but knowing where that was what I'm

---------00:59----------
gonna do is I'm gonna match up the

---------01:01----------
little spot of pigeon on the board

---------01:02----------
with this and what I see is this and you

---------01:05----------
can see you can you tell like it's this

---------01:07----------
is something that I would miss going

---------01:09----------
over the board with my eyes I'd probably

---------01:10----------
never ever see this but now it's really

---------01:13----------
obvious that there's a problem here with

---------01:16----------
this I see see that so what I'm gonna do

---------01:21----------
here is I'm gonna go over to the board

---------01:22----------
view software and we're gonna check out

---------01:24----------
on the board view software what that is

---------01:26----------
and what that does when I go to the

---------01:28----------
board view software what I see is let's

---------01:31----------
just get it back into view this board

---------01:33----------
view software is crap I'm sure any of

---------01:35----------
you who've been doing this you know

---------01:37----------
you're fully aware that this stuff is

---------01:38----------
garbage let's see I don't give a

---------01:42----------
about your birthday you so crap your

---------01:43----------
screens go away ah let's see okay here

---------01:46----------
we go so it's a burned piece I'm not as

---------01:53----------
good at pac-man this morning as I

---------01:54----------
usually am there you go so pin 20 have

---------01:56----------
you 70 100

---------02:02----------
damn this program is sucking more than

---------02:04----------
usual which is pp5 ESL on you 70 100 so

---------02:08----------
this chip use 70 100 here this chip is

---------02:11----------
responsible for creating an SL power

---------02:13----------
rail of PPV CCS a underscore s o

---------02:16----------
underscore rec so let's just see what

---------02:19----------
this is responsible for so this is

---------02:21----------
create about you 70 100 it is let's take

---------02:25----------
a look

---------02:27----------
it goes through our 71 42 no real idea

---------02:31----------
so let's see on here where that goes of

---------02:36----------
course it's not found it's probably

---------02:38----------
called something else on here alright of

---------02:44----------
course it's no me who we kidding okay so

---------02:46----------
the schematic says that you should find

---------02:49----------
it in our 71 40 so let's see what that

---------02:51----------
is over here so that looks like a

---------02:53----------
current sensing resistor for this okay

---------02:56----------
so they call it something different over

---------02:58----------
here go figure so yeah it looks

---------03:03----------
like something that goes to the CPU yeah

---------03:09----------
so you could see over here that this is

---------03:11----------
pretty much used for the CPU now the

---------03:14----------
problem here is that I have an SL rail

---------03:16----------
that's that I'm going to take a wild

---------03:17----------
guess that that SL rail is missing

---------03:19----------
because that chip is actually burned so

---------03:21----------
when we go back to you 7100 on the

---------03:23----------
schematic you'll see that you 7100 that

---------03:26----------
pin that pin that's burned is one of the

---------03:29----------
VCC pins over here that's required for

---------03:31----------
this chip to actually turn on and this

---------03:32----------
chip is used to control this buck

---------03:36----------
regulator which is going to take buck

---------03:38----------
converter technically which is going to

---------03:39----------
take this higher power over here pp VIN

---------03:41----------
sov si si si whatever and it's gonna

---------03:45----------
turn that into this PPV si si si s Oh

---------03:48----------
reg rail so let's just take a look at

---------03:51----------
where that comes from so this comes from

---------03:53----------
pp VIN bla bla computing I sense that

---------03:56----------
comes from pp bus g3 hot as you can see

---------03:58----------
so let's say we're it is to take this is

---------04:00----------
the rail that's a sub rail of this one

---------04:02----------
we take that rail and we see that that

---------04:04----------
rail is well you know it actually

---------04:08----------
doesn't listed as a sub rail of this one

---------04:10----------
does it pp bus s5 high side computing I

---------04:14----------
sense PP VIN

---------04:16----------
same it's it's it really is the

---------04:18----------
same like this is the same as this

---------04:20----------
which is the same as this so what this

---------04:21----------
thing does is it takes eight point four

---------04:23----------
volts takes eight point four volts and

---------04:24----------
turns it into the whatever voltage is

---------04:26----------
the CPU wants now again we can take a

---------04:28----------
wild guess at that power rail is missing

---------04:30----------
because pin 20 is the one that's burned

---------04:32----------
and that's a VCC pin as I've explained

---------04:34----------
in other videos the VCC pin the VDD pin

---------04:36----------
the V end pin whatever that is think of

---------04:38----------
that like the pins on the back of your

---------04:42----------
soldering station where you plug the IEC

---------04:44----------
cord into turn it on so this is where

---------04:45----------
you're expecting power input and power

---------04:47----------
and puts not there so the first thing I

---------04:49----------
want to do here is I want to see is the

---------04:50----------
board actually in in Essos state and

---------04:53----------
that's for state and there's five state

---------04:55----------
what power state is it in so Esso is you

---------04:58----------
know keep in mind all these core i5 i7

---------04:59----------
series MacBooks they're designed to turn

---------05:02----------
on from the second you put the charge

---------05:03----------
room so as soon as I plug this charger

---------05:05----------
in I should it should turn on the fan

---------05:07----------
should spin I should start seeing s oh

---------05:09----------
rails become present so I want to see

---------05:10----------
what state I'm gonna work my way down so

---------05:12----------
what I'm gonna do over here is I'm gonna

---------05:13----------
see if I have an S or L present so let's

---------05:15----------
just go back here and let's search for

---------05:17----------
let's search for PP five ESO and see

---------05:20----------
where that shows up because that is an S

---------05:21----------
or L PP 5e underscore SL let's see if

---------05:27----------
there's any easy places to measure on

---------05:29----------
this side not much in terms of easy

---------05:30----------
places to measure the software is just

---------05:36----------
downright awful alright so we're gonna

---------05:38----------
measure for PP 5 vs oh and here's a good

---------05:42----------
space to measure for it it's a good spot

---------05:44----------
to measure so

---------05:52----------
okay so we have the multimeter over here

---------05:54----------
so now the board is plugged in it's not

---------05:56----------
on you can see it's a much dad you know

---------05:59----------
you have a light but it's not actually

---------06:01----------
powering so what I'm going to do is I'm

---------06:02----------
going to measure the voltage on PP 5 vs

---------06:05----------
Oh

---------06:18----------
so pp5 es I was there I have five volts

---------06:21----------
so this means if the machine is here's

---------06:22----------
the good thing it's really hard to get

---------06:25----------
so those things like let's say p.m.

---------06:26----------
sleep s4l which is what Allah gets the

---------06:28----------
Machine you know to an s4 and s3 state

---------06:30----------
it's really hard to get stuff like that

---------06:31----------
going when it's not there that can be a

---------06:33----------
royal pain in the ass that can be a lot

---------06:35----------
of different things and it's very often

---------06:37----------
to be quite honest a total nightmare but

---------06:39----------
this it's 99% of it's already there you

---------06:42----------
have your green light the SMC is going

---------06:44----------
it's doing what it's supposed to you

---------06:45----------
have your steady s5 rails as three rails

---------06:48----------
and there so so again the machine is

---------06:50----------
gonna be in an s5 state then when you

---------06:51----------
it's gonna try to enter an s3 state

---------06:53----------
which is sleep or suspend then it's

---------06:54----------
gonna try to enter an Esso state which

---------06:56----------
is I'm on and I'm working if you don't

---------06:58----------
know what that is Google the power

---------06:59----------
states of a computer s5 is either off or

---------07:02----------
hibernate s3 is suspend sleeping like

---------07:05----------
when you send little white light

---------07:05----------
blinking on the front of your MacBook

---------07:07----------
after you close the lid it's it's not

---------07:08----------
off but it's not on either and then you

---------07:11----------
have SL which is when it's actually on

---------07:12----------
so 99% of the hard stuff here again it's

---------07:14----------
done I got a light I have my main power

---------07:16----------
rails are there all I'm missing is I'm

---------07:19----------
gonna take wild guess that the CPU one

---------07:21----------
is missing and again I'm not gonna do a

---------07:23----------
lot of research to figure it out I'm not

---------07:24----------
even gonna bother measuring the rail

---------07:25----------
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do the

---------07:27----------
things that I can do with my brain off

---------07:29----------
now one of the things I talk about is

---------07:32----------
knowing when to have your brain turned

---------07:34----------
off so that you could kind of save it

---------07:35----------
for the other stuff so you can use your

---------07:38----------
brain to kind of try to figure out

---------07:40----------
what's wrong with this and go through

---------07:41----------
every single rail in the sequence or you

---------07:42----------
could just go hmm there is a big blotch

---------07:45----------
of green stuff over here

---------07:46----------
use your brain just enough to try to

---------07:48----------
figure out that where that is on this

---------07:50----------
board look and see that there's a thing

---------07:52----------
on this board that's burned yeah let's

---------07:55----------
just go over what's burned and also what

---------07:58----------
that tells me since that PP 5es over a

---------08:00----------
pin is burned that means that anything

---------08:02----------
else that's gonna be on the PP 5e

---------08:03----------
underscore SL bus maybe burn so let's

---------08:06----------
say I replace that and they get that

---------08:07----------
rail but something else is wrong I'm

---------08:09----------
gonna look for things that are powered

---------08:10----------
off with a PP 5 es el bus what I can

---------08:12----------
assume here is that the PP 5 ESO went

---------08:14----------
high for a second so maybe instead of

---------08:16----------
being 5 volts it was 6 7 or 9 for a

---------08:18----------
split second and that's what caused that

---------08:19----------
to blow up as a result of the liquid so

---------08:21----------
let's start with this and if this

---------08:23----------
doesn't work we're gonna look at the

---------08:24----------
other things on the PP 5 ESO bus that

---------08:25----------
could be wrong

---------08:26----------
so that go into the microscope I'm going

---------08:29----------
to turn on the soldering station

---------08:31----------
turn the rework machine and let's get

---------08:34----------
started so this is my chip

---------08:47----------
so I'm just gonna get that thing heated

---------08:49----------
up it takes a second for the hot air to

---------08:52----------
heat up you know the fr you know one

---------08:53----------
isn't new anymore and I'm gonna get

---------08:56----------
myself a few donor boards one or two

---------08:59----------
just in case the one that I picked out

---------09:00----------
of the bin is missing anything that I

---------09:02----------
need

---------09:03----------
most of these donor boards are missing

---------09:06----------
everything that I need they've been

---------09:07----------
they've been thoroughly thoroughly

---------09:10----------
sodomized actually almost every single

---------09:23----------
one of them is missing the thing that I

---------09:24----------
need all right so the hot-air station

---------09:26----------
should be hot by now which means I could

---------09:27----------
turn on the fuel extractor one thing to

---------09:33----------
note if you're doing any of this type of

---------09:34----------
work I know it's annoying to have this

---------09:36----------
thing on it is very loud you can't hear

---------09:38----------
it in these videos because I use isotope

---------09:39----------
rx4 to remove a lot of the noise you can

---------09:42----------
hear a little bit of it but you can't

---------09:43----------
hear all of it and I also have a

---------09:44----------
microphone really close to my mouth so

---------09:46----------
the reason I have this mic really close

---------09:48----------
to my mouth is that you can hear just

---------09:50----------
how loud a lot of this stuff is so I can

---------09:51----------
actually provide an instruction during

---------09:54----------
the video but this thing is annoying as

---------09:56----------
hell but as annoying as it is the

---------09:59----------
alternative which is inhaling flux fumes

---------10:02----------
all day is really a really really bad

---------10:05----------
alternative

---------10:26----------
I'm gonna take that capacitor off too

---------10:29----------
because let's face it that's junk so

---------10:31----------
what I'm gonna try to do here is I'm

---------10:32----------
gonna try to tin the pads with my

---------10:33----------
standard iron and I'm also gonna try to

---------10:35----------
scratch away a lot of that corrosion

---------10:43----------
while I'm here I'm gonna try to do both

---------10:49----------
at the same time I got some quality

---------10:51----------
Ametek flux this is the mTEC NC the 5 v

---------10:56----------
9 v 2 TF and let's see what we can do

---------11:01----------
here so I'm gonna try to remove the old

---------11:03----------
move the old lead-free solder add let it

---------11:06----------
solder and also kind of scrape away at

---------11:08----------
the corrosion all at the same time so we

---------11:12----------
have a little bit of an ambitious task

---------11:13----------
here now I'm gonna use the other end of

---------11:19----------
the iron to kind of just bad Chan sound

---------11:23----------
a little gentle scraping but it seems

---------11:26----------
like the bottom of that pad is too far

---------11:28----------
burned for any gentle scraping to do

---------11:30----------
anything as you can see I've scraped

---------11:32----------
away at that entire trace and I haven't

---------11:34----------
made any progress at all on there so now

---------11:39----------
I'm gonna try scraping away with with

---------11:41----------
the micro pencil

---------12:04----------
you

---------12:14----------
okay so the micro pen the FX 9:51

---------12:17----------
 a little bit when you switch

---------12:18----------
from one iron to the other yeah there

---------12:20----------
was like four beeps in a row the whole

---------12:22----------
idea behind the four beeps in a row is

---------12:23----------
that it's pissed off that I didn't buy

---------12:25----------
the FM 203 and I understand that it's

---------12:28----------
pissed off that I didn't buy the FM two

---------12:30----------
or three I get that but I also but I

---------12:32----------
don't I don't give a you I'm

---------12:34----------
not giving hack all more money when I

---------12:36----------
can literally hang the stuff I got I get

---------12:38----------
right now I have a little screw it in my

---------12:40----------
wall or in the nail screw whatever and I

---------12:43----------
coil up my old art with the other iron

---------12:45----------
and I put it right behind me when it's

---------12:47----------
time to use this I plug it right in you

---------12:50----------
know as dumb as this is gonna sound

---------12:51----------
really dumb but the you know while it

---------12:53----------
was that practical board repair school

---------12:55----------
Jessa has the FM 203 and these other

---------12:57----------
irons where you switch one on and switch

---------12:59----------
one off and HECO doesn't really have

---------13:01----------
like a regular setup for it it says s

---------13:03----------
and D so one of the things I was talking

---------13:05----------
about my reviews of the other hacker

---------13:07----------
gear was how annoying

---------13:08----------
a lot of the interface is on a lot of

---------13:10----------
these products and you know again like

---------13:12----------
on this it's it you have this alarm

---------13:13----------
clock in 1980s alarm clock interface

---------13:15----------
that's really really really just not

---------13:18----------
user intuitive at all and she has one

---------13:20----------
where again it says SMD and like

---------13:23----------
sometimes you I don't know if you're

---------13:24----------
supposed to hold down the button to

---------13:26----------
switch between them I don't know if

---------13:27----------
you're supposed like if you hold down

---------13:30----------
the button or if you press it twice so

---------13:32----------
you press it once I can't tell when this

---------13:33----------
shit's on or off because again this is

---------13:35----------
one number on the screen is that for the

---------13:36----------
left eye and the right eye on who the

---------13:38----------
 knows the JBC station is very very

---------13:40----------
simple it shows you which iron what

---------13:43----------
temperature which iron is at you know it

---------13:45----------
makes sense the hakko one does not make

---------13:46----------
sense so what I do is and again the

---------13:51----------
thing is I could spend more money on the

---------13:53----------
hakko station that's dual-port for it to

---------13:55----------
not make sense or I could use my

---------13:58----------
existing station and do what works for

---------14:01----------
me which is to plug that you know

---------14:03----------
be under just uh plug the iron in and

---------14:05----------
then when I'm done with it I unplug that

---------14:07----------
iron and I plug my other iron in which

---------14:09----------
is hanging right behind it on the wall

---------14:10----------
the other benefit of this is that it

---------14:13----------
takes up a lot less space and you know

---------14:15----------
and where I work so again if I were to

---------14:17----------
show you where I work you know

---------14:19----------
look okay I'm gonna move the microscope

---------14:21----------
out of the way look when I move the

---------14:23----------
microscope this almost comes out the

---------14:24----------
table so this is my hot air station this

---------14:27----------
is my soldering iron this is my you know

---------14:31----------
this is my stand I don't have space for

---------14:33----------
two stands here if I put a stand here

---------14:34----------
when I move the microscope the bar is

---------14:36----------
gonna hit if I try to put another stand

---------14:38----------
here it's gonna fall off because hako

---------14:40----------
doesn't make gear flat anymore why they

---------14:41----------
don't make your flat anymore is beyond

---------14:43----------
me this thing being flat is if if I had

---------14:45----------
the new fr a 10 this station would not

---------14:47----------
work you have to understand that this

---------14:48----------
being flat and me being able to put this

---------14:50----------
on top of this is the only reason that

---------14:52----------
this works when you look at the hakko fr

---------14:54----------
810 the new one which I will never ever

---------14:55----------
recommend you buy just just based on the

---------14:57----------
fact that they've made it not flat

---------14:59----------
really that that it's that it's that

---------15:01----------
important like you can't stack I need my

---------15:04----------
workspace I have a 200 square foot

---------15:05----------
office when I do over here as you can

---------15:07----------
see is I having a little nail on the

---------15:08----------
wall so I'm just gonna move back so you

---------15:10----------
can see it and my iron is right behind

---------15:12----------
me so again when I want to switch none

---------15:15----------
of that paying an extra 1 or 2 or 300

---------15:16----------
bucks for a different station I

---------15:18----------
literally just I unplug and I plug it

---------15:20----------
back in and I know when it's on I know

---------15:23----------
what temperature it's at when it's on I

---------15:24----------
don't have to deal with the alarm clock

---------15:26----------
 to tell anyway it's small

---------15:28----------
detail from the actual video but back to

---------15:32----------
what our regularly scheduled programming

---------15:34----------
before I decided to about hack oh

---------15:36----------
and their interfaces better hair well so

---------15:41----------
anyway so what I did there as I just ran

---------15:42----------
the jumper wire because as you could see

---------15:44----------
the pad was there and the pad was

---------15:46----------
savable but the problem that the problem

---------15:48----------
with that pad is that it wasn't actually

---------15:49----------
connected to the trace so if I were to

---------15:52----------
solder that on I would have never gotten

---------15:53----------
pp5 DSL so what I did I did leave a

---------15:56----------
little bit of the pad there because

---------15:57----------
leaving a little bit of the pad there

---------15:58----------
means when I heat this end of the wire

---------15:59----------
to get rid of that little excess solder

---------16:01----------
that I see yeah I just clean the hair

---------16:06----------
off of them off of the flux the flux

---------16:09----------
dispenser what's gonna happen is it's

---------16:13----------
not gonna jump away from there see what

---------16:15----------
I just did there if that wasn't cited

---------16:16----------
over there that the wire would have just

---------16:18----------
came right off with it so now I'm ready

---------16:19----------
to put another chip on so I'm gonna go

---------16:21----------
to my donor board that actually still

---------16:23----------
has that chip

---------16:33----------
and the donor board that I took that

---------16:35----------
chip off of actually as a chip that is

---------16:37----------
more burns than the one that I'm

---------16:39----------
currently working with are you kidding

---------16:41----------
me

---------16:41----------
let's see what does it look like okay

---------16:46----------
see how it's missing half a pad

---------16:48----------
that that is this is yeah yeah

---------16:53----------
 that I'm not I'm not useless next

---------16:55----------
the sport has a hole in it and obviously

---------16:58----------
the reason it has a hole in it is

---------16:59----------
because somebody didn't know that they

---------17:01----------
could fix the Esso rail for the cpu the

---------17:03----------
amount of these boards that I look at

---------17:05----------
where like I it has a hole in it but I

---------17:08----------
know the original problem was fixable is

---------17:10----------
getting higher and higher

---------17:11----------
I mean well if this had been given to me

---------17:19----------
I would have fixed it these that's a

---------17:28----------
maybe seriously all the whole boards

---------17:31----------
have a destroyed CPU vcore circuit I

---------17:33----------
gotta find it

---------17:34----------
I gotta find these people and offer them

---------17:37----------
like maybe a group rate or something on

---------17:40----------
the on the training course Yesi these

---------17:43----------
people would be rich if they weren't

---------17:44----------
throwing this crap in the garbage I

---------17:46----------
don't understand why are you throwing

---------17:48----------
this away you're selling this crap for

---------17:51----------
fifteen to thirty bucks you selling it

---------17:54----------
for 169 or 250 or 450 bucks depending on

---------17:57----------
what model the board is Scott's

---------18:02----------
stupid so stupid what's really

---------18:07----------
stupid is putting the hole through it

---------18:08----------
cuz if you didn't put the hole through

---------18:09----------
it though this would be a problem to

---------18:10----------
begin with when you alright so let's

---------18:17----------
remove that chip from the donor board

---------18:21----------
let's move the fume extractor over put

---------18:24----------
some flux down there okay so the donor

---------18:30----------
board is gonna be over here on the desk

---------18:32----------
so I move the fume extractor right over

---------18:34----------
they have flux on it

---------18:59----------
now I move a fume extractor backed over

---------19:01----------
here pray that this chip doesn't run

---------19:04----------
away while I change open broadcast her

---------19:06----------
back to the microscope this chip it

---------19:12----------
better not fly into my air filter

---------19:34----------
ya see what I'm doing it has to be

---------19:36----------
pushed down on the board that's

---------19:37----------
important if it's not flatten the board

---------19:39----------
the do you know the more you won't make

---------19:41----------
contact and this one won't work so then

---------19:46----------
I'm gonna go around it with my micro

---------19:48----------
pencil and we're gonna make sure that

---------19:49----------
it's actually you sawed it on there

---------19:51----------
properly

---------19:52----------
I feel each individual joint as I go

---------20:13----------
those ones are gonna be a particular

---------20:14----------
interest to me obviously and now I have

---------20:23----------
to take but that capacitor down there

---------21:22----------
so much reflection

---------21:30----------
it'll become clearer to see once I use

---------21:32----------
the hot air and now I want to make sure

---------21:36----------
that my jumper is in place so I'm gonna

---------21:38----------
do is I'm gonna hold the jumper properly

---------21:41----------
so that it doesn't move away or stick to

---------21:43----------
my iron while I solder it directly to

---------21:46----------
the chipping and I really want to make

---------21:47----------
sure that that jumper is soldered

---------21:49----------
straight to my chip I want to know that

---------21:58----------
that ship is getting PP 5 eso

---------22:16----------
no reason to keep a little solder blob

---------22:18----------
on the side there you can get rid of

---------22:20----------
that

---------22:26----------
okay it's now first thing I want to do

---------22:28----------
is I want to see if there's any change

---------22:30----------
so what I remove that that issue and

---------22:33----------
let's see if I have any any any positive

---------22:37----------
results so you know plug in as you can

---------22:48----------
see my fan is spinning which you know

---------22:54----------
let's not let's not ruin the excitement

---------22:57----------
of the fun my cpu IM vp ton resist t

---------23:00----------
ohen for time on I like to call ton

---------23:02----------
resistor is looking good so I'm pretty

---------23:04----------
sure that that means I'll have V Corps

---------23:05----------
and yeah so let's just go over this

---------23:08----------
again so the whole idea here is that

---------23:10----------
when you look at the act this is why

---------23:12----------
having the whole computer is saying that

---------23:13----------
I really asked for from people sending

---------23:15----------
stuff here seeing the entire computer

---------23:17----------
allowed me to do this diagnosis have a

---------23:19----------
commentary while half asleep and and

---------23:23----------
still fix the board inside of what 20

---------23:25----------
something nuts whereas without that it

---------23:27----------
would have taken a lot longer if it took

---------23:28----------
a lot longer it would be lower priority

---------23:30----------
lower priority means longer turnaround

---------23:31----------
then it's just you know this makes

---------23:34----------
everything just that much easier it's

---------23:36----------
that much simpler so what a lot of

---------23:39----------
people think is genius is really just me

---------23:40----------
having some common sense and following

---------23:42----------
along and looking through to see what it

---------23:44----------
is that was wrong and just based on

---------23:46----------
where the damage was and then again I

---------23:48----------
can come up with a theory as to what

---------23:50----------
happened based on that so something like

---------23:52----------
this is kind of what tells me that in s

---------23:55----------
Oreille being not present will keep it

---------23:58----------
from turning on but it can still enter

---------24:00----------
an Esso state so like a few years ago

---------24:02----------
with this end of the knowledge base I

---------24:03----------
know that this board is internet it can

---------24:05----------
be in an SSL state even with around

---------24:07----------
missing it's not gonna just jump back to

---------24:09----------
an s3 state it's everything's gonna turn

---------24:10----------
on except for that one well you just

---------24:12----------
kind of learn this stuff just from just

---------24:13----------
just for poking around so I'm looking at

---------24:15----------
stuff that you otherwise wouldn't have

---------24:17----------
looked at but yeah okay so what I said

---------24:20----------
about how the fan spins so I should be

---------24:22----------
good to go right I completely missed the

---------24:26----------
entire backlight section of the

---------24:28----------
motherboard none of which was actually

---------24:30----------
working so let's just take a look here

---------24:33----------
and like so yeah so we have this this

---------24:36----------
switch trace

---------24:39----------
we have this line that comes here for

---------24:42----------
backlight enable this is what we

---------24:45----------
actually worked on the yeah here we go

---------24:49----------
that was for the CPU power we have it

---------24:53----------
gets it gets better so the LCD connector

---------24:55----------
was missing pins three and four they

---------24:57----------
usually burnt here they were actually

---------24:59----------
completely 100% missing so that was that

---------25:03----------
was that was some fun right there then

---------25:09----------
we had right over here so that's where

---------25:14----------
it's going to the backlight enable

---------25:15----------
resistors that is the new backlight fuse

---------25:18----------
that backlight fuse is going to this

---------25:20----------
resistor which was responsible for the

---------25:22----------
voltage divider that's going to send

---------25:23----------
power through the whole machine this

---------25:25----------
yeah this was this was and now it

---------25:29----------
is slightly less which which is a

---------25:32----------
good thing

---------25:34----------
hopefully this actually yes D&B good to

---------25:39----------
go because I know one thing's for

---------25:42----------
certain I am NOT spending another second

---------25:44----------
on this board
