---------00:00----------
today I'm going to be going over a

---------00:00----------
common problem on MacBook Airs which is

---------00:02----------
that on a DC power supply when you plug

---------00:04----------
it in it's only pulling between 2 to 250

---------00:07----------
milliamps so I take these MagSafe

---------00:09----------
adapters I always start with an 85 watt

---------00:11----------
because I want the tip to tell the

---------00:12----------
computer that it's 85 watt in case I'm

---------00:14----------
plugging it into a pro I always take

---------00:16----------
these adapters and what I do is I

---------00:18----------
snipped the tip off and then I plug it

---------00:20----------
into a DC power supply this way I'm not

---------00:22----------
always going through adapters and

---------00:24----------
killing them and I also get to see

---------00:26----------
exactly how much power that it's being

---------00:28----------
drawn from the DC power supply so if I

---------00:31----------
plug this in as you'll see it is dead

---------00:34----------
now if I go over to my DC power supply

---------00:36----------
over here just take my camera move it

---------00:39----------
around the store you'll see that well

---------00:44----------
the first thing you'll see is that

---------00:45----------
Paul's HDMI port got destroyed by me

---------00:48----------
trying to plug in the wrong cable but

---------00:50----------
the second thing you'll see here is that

---------00:52----------
I'm drawing about 200 milliamps anywhere

---------00:57----------
from 180 to 200 milliamps when I have it

---------00:59----------
set to 18 volt and it's dead over here

---------01:02----------
you'll see that we have a power rails

---------01:03----------
page and on this page of rails we have

---------01:06----------
suffix and prefix so the prefix is going

---------01:09----------
to tell us how many volts the power L is

---------01:12----------
typically so P P 3 V 4 - that's 3.42

---------01:14----------
volts pp 5 vs 5 PP 5 v 5 volts and the

---------01:21----------
suffix is going to tell us the state

---------01:23----------
that that rail will be on so s 5 means

---------01:25----------
be on while the machine is off s 4 that

---------01:29----------
power out should be present when the

---------01:30----------
machine is hibernating s oh that should

---------01:32----------
be present when the machine is on so s 5

---------01:35----------
is going to be when the machines off S 4

---------01:37----------
is gonna be when it's hibernating s 3 is

---------01:39----------
when it's in suspend as always going to

---------01:41----------
be when the machine is on and working

---------01:43----------
and the CPU and everything should be on

---------01:45----------
and working now the what this usually

---------01:48----------
means when we are taking about a hundred

---------01:49----------
80 milliamps on the airs to the 8 - 0 34

---------01:52----------
37 s and also the eight two zero zero

---------01:54----------
zero one six five s is that all the Esso

---------01:57----------
rails are going to be present it besides

---------01:59----------
one so let's see if that is the case

---------02:01----------
here so I'm going to get my camera zoom

---------02:04----------
down on my meter since I still haven't

---------02:06----------
gotten a multimeter that reliably works

---------02:10----------
with the machine in Windows

---------02:14----------
got to buy myself a new one since this

---------02:17----------
one's acting up so let's turn this thing

---------02:19----------
into voltage mode and see what we get if

---------02:24----------
I try to measure let's say PP 5 vs L so

---------02:27----------
PP 5 ESO is going to be present around

---------02:29----------
my fan connector over here so I could

---------02:32----------
just go over to my fan connector area

---------02:37----------
and let's take a look and see what it is

---------02:41----------
that I get so if I do this and I do this

---------02:46----------
as you'll see I do get 5 volts which

---------02:49----------
means that one of my SL rails is likely

---------02:51----------
missing now if I were to check for

---------02:53----------
something like let's say CPU v core

---------02:55----------
which is also an Esso rail the CPU is

---------02:57----------
supposed to turn on while the thing is

---------02:59----------
on if we move over here for CPU you'll

---------03:02----------
see that I'm getting 0 volts so let's

---------03:07----------
take a look through the board and see if

---------03:09----------
there's an obvious cause for us not

---------03:12----------
having our voltage so if we look through

---------03:18----------
it's furry this board is a furry it's

---------03:24----------
quite a fairy board and if you go to the

---------03:28----------
bottom of it

---------03:34----------
m-yeah gross

---------03:38----------
so let's see what this area the board is

---------03:41----------
for since that is fairly disgusting now

---------03:43----------
if you were to go over to our board view

---------03:45----------
software that is oh here we go

---------03:53----------
queue 8150 and queue 8150 is going to be

---------03:58----------
for the all sis power good circuit so

---------04:02----------
the way this works is most of the

---------04:04----------
primary power well shoot out a P good

---------04:06----------
signal as you can see here the so DDR

---------04:09----------
reg P good P 1 vo 5 s so P good P 5 vs 4

---------04:12----------
P good one v8 s 3 P good and so on and

---------04:17----------
so forth and if any one of those is

---------04:18----------
missing it'll pull the rail down and all

---------04:21----------
says power good is pulled up by p.m.

---------04:23----------
sleeve s 3 buff L on our 8167 so if any

---------04:27----------
one of those rails is missing we are

---------04:28----------
screwed now to be in an Esso state you

---------04:33----------
have to have all the rails below

---------04:34----------
so let's if we're in an S 4 state we can

---------04:36----------
immediately assume that all the S 5

---------04:37----------
rails are working if we're in an s3

---------04:39----------
state we can assume all the S 5 and his

---------04:41----------
four rails are working and if we're in

---------04:42----------
an Esso state we can assume that all the

---------04:44----------
s 5 s 4 and s 3 rails are working the s

---------04:47----------
o rails are going to be created by the

---------04:49----------
rails that came before it you cannot be

---------04:51----------
in an Esso State if you're missing S 4 S

---------04:53----------
5 rails that's and think of it like a

---------04:55----------
pyramid it's a hierarchy it has to work

---------04:57----------
that way and it has to progress in that

---------04:59----------
linear fashion all right so let's just

---------05:03----------
clean up this area over here a little

---------05:07----------
bit I'm just gonna add some of flux kick

---------05:12----------
on my fume extractor

---------05:18----------
and get to work so

---------05:24----------
we're just gonna do a little bit of a

---------05:26----------
cleanup job

---------05:41----------
if any of the joints are cracked they

---------05:43----------
should get fixed through this process

---------06:08----------
[Music]

---------06:15----------
you know I'm gonna take some solder and

---------06:17----------
make those resistors a little bit nicer

---------06:20----------
than they were before

---------06:27----------
and give it like filing your nails just

---------06:30----------
gently filing your nails like so now

---------06:37----------
that some of these resistors will be

---------06:39----------
fine some of them will be too far gone

---------06:42----------
and I don't want to see which ones those

---------06:44----------
are so for example something like that

---------06:48----------
while corroded can be made silver again

---------06:51----------
that one can be made shiny again but

---------06:55----------
some of these will not be made shiny

---------06:57----------
again and those are the ones that we're

---------07:01----------
going to be repealing and replacing with

---------07:05----------
better ones

---------07:28----------
there we go

---------07:32----------
get rid of some of the junk on that

---------07:34----------
joint

---------07:46----------
so much flux so reflective

---------07:56----------
I won't have a nice tiny small healthy

---------07:58----------
mound of solder on each and there I

---------08:01----------
think we have now it's time to grab a

---------08:04----------
nice resistant set from a nice-looking

---------08:07----------
donor board a pretty donor board that

---------08:11----------
doesn't have any corrosion on it a

---------08:14----------
fitter happier more productive donor do

---------08:20----------
we have that well it seems that we do

---------08:22----------
now one thing that I like to do here

---------08:24----------
that I talk about on stream a lot is I

---------08:27----------
don't put the board that I'm stealing

---------08:29----------
from under the microscope I put the

---------08:31----------
board that I'm working on under the

---------08:32----------
microscope and the reason for that is if

---------08:35----------
I pick up this component and then I try

---------08:37----------
to move this board under the microscope

---------08:38----------
whatever I have in my tweezers is gonna

---------08:40----------
fall down and it's also not efficient if

---------08:42----------
I'm stealing numerous components at a

---------08:44----------
time so I all right now I don't really

---------08:47----------
particularly care about accuracy or on

---------08:51----------
the donor board because I'm going to be

---------08:53----------
you know it's junk so if I happen to

---------08:56----------
knock something off on the donor I don't

---------08:58----------
particularly care that's something I

---------09:00----------
care about on the board that I am

---------09:01----------
soldering up but not so much on the

---------09:04----------
board that I'm stealing from so like

---------09:07----------
just for example there I just so happen

---------09:09----------
to knock something off because I wasn't

---------09:10----------
looking for the microscope but it's

---------09:13----------
broken anyway so I don't particularly

---------09:15----------
have to care so I can just grab another

---------09:18----------
one and do this

---------09:46----------
okay we put everything back we're gonna

---------09:49----------
use them grassman patented rapid cool

---------09:52----------
technology to cool off the board prior

---------09:54----------
to running any electricity through it so

---------09:59----------
there we go we got some rapid cool

---------10:00----------
technology going on BAM

---------10:04----------
beautiful mwah what a perfect looking

---------10:08----------
little board fitter happier more

---------10:14----------
productive sitter happier more

---------10:21----------
productive fitter happier more

---------10:26----------
productive

---------10:34----------
[Music]

---------10:36----------
and

---------10:41----------
yeah I should just replace that one -

---------10:43----------
shouldn't I alright alright oh please

---------10:50----------
you're right when you're right you're

---------10:53----------
right

---------10:53----------
and you're alright Tesla place

---------11:04----------
and that one's missing from this donor

---------11:08----------
okay

---------11:17----------
that's Karma for you

---------11:20----------
I lose a resistor and then I need a

---------11:22----------
resistor that's karma karma Holies all

---------11:39----------
right now let's go for another round of

---------11:40----------
the rapid cool technology

---------11:53----------
hmm

---------11:58----------
should have done that when there was

---------11:59----------
flux on the board the I suppose better

---------12:02----------
late than never make everything look a

---------12:05----------
little bit sexier all right now let's

---------12:11----------
see if we get a fan spin do you think

---------12:14----------
we're gonna have a fan spin oh yeah and

---------12:20----------
as we can see if we move my camera over

---------12:26----------
we're grabbing a nice healthy six to

---------12:29----------
seven hundred milliamps sometimes going

---------12:31----------
down a five hundred but still completely

---------12:33----------
healthy

---------12:34----------
so just to recap when we have the issue

---------12:41----------
where we're drawing about 180 to 220

---------12:44----------
milliamps that's typically an issue

---------12:46----------
where every Sol is present but the

---------12:48----------
Machine is not turning on this can be

---------12:50----------
caused by platform reset el being held

---------12:52----------
low which is a nightmare most of the

---------12:53----------
time it's simply being held low by an

---------12:55----------
issue in the all sister would circle or

---------12:57----------
it's being held low or it's being held

---------12:59----------
there because one of the SL rails is

---------13:02----------
missing and remember you need all the

---------13:03----------
Esso rails to work in order for the

---------13:05----------
machine to turn on if one of the Esso

---------13:07----------
rails is missing it's gonna do that

---------13:08----------
thing where you know it thinks it's on

---------13:10----------
but it's not really on and that's

---------13:12----------
something that you can tell by attaching

---------13:14----------
a MagSafe to a DC power supply and being

---------13:18----------
able to read the amount of amperage that

---------13:19----------
it's putting out I knew that I did not

---------13:21----------
have to check for p.m. sleep s4l missing

---------13:24----------
I know I didn't have to check for PP 5

---------13:25----------
es 5 missing I'm not gonna check PMDs W

---------13:28----------
power good I'm not gonna check anything

---------13:29----------
for the lower rails because this setup

---------13:32----------
has allowed me to tell instantaneously

---------13:34----------
where my issue likely lies and just like

---------13:37----------
with diode mode measurements where you

---------13:38----------
make a diode mode measurement to ground

---------13:40----------
on certain parts of the board so maybe

---------13:42----------
you've seen me do something like the red

---------13:44----------
probe on grounds and black probe on

---------13:47----------
backlight output and then diode mode the

---------13:49----------
same way that I can tell instantly if

---------13:51----------
it's the feedback trace blown 0.469 0.5

---------13:55----------
11 bad LED driver 0.2 to 0.3 bad switch

---------13:59----------
price point 2 to point 3 or broken LCD

---------14:02----------
connector 0.007 I can tell here very

---------14:06----------
quickly exactly what the issue is with

---------14:08----------
the board by writing down the amount of

---------14:11----------
amps that

---------14:12----------
using and then correlating that to the

---------14:14----------
problem once I figured it out so then

---------14:15----------
the important thing if you're doing

---------14:17----------
repairs day-in day-out same thing over

---------14:19----------
and over and over again is that you can

---------14:21----------
limit the amount of time that you spend

---------14:23----------
using your brain if you can go through

---------14:26----------
your day without having to use your

---------14:27----------
brain much on the repetitive problems

---------14:30----------
that means that you can use your brain

---------14:31----------
for the new problems and the money is

---------14:33----------
always going to be long-term in figuring

---------14:35----------
out those new problems and writing them

---------14:37----------
down and then coming up with a way to

---------14:39----------
allow others to follow in your footsteps

---------14:42----------
to figure it out the more you can create

---------14:45----------
a manual for yourself by using things

---------14:47----------
like a diode mode measurement so the

---------14:48----------
amperage readings from the power supply

---------14:50----------
the easier it is to train newbies who

---------14:53----------
may not know every single signature

---------14:54----------
fault like you do and as to how to do

---------14:57----------
this type of work and also the quicker

---------14:59----------
and more productive you can be so that's

---------15:00----------
it for today and as always I hope you

---------15:02----------
learned something and if this

---------15:03----------

---------15:19----------
books from 2008 to the present and also
