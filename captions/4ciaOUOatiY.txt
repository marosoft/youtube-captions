---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going we're gonna

---------00:02----------
get started today with yet another

---------00:03----------
macbook repair are we all excited hey

---------00:07----------
you still ticked off at those Bulgarians

---------00:09----------
you know I'm more pissed off at the fact

---------00:11----------
there when I google macbook logic board

---------00:14----------
repair Belgium the first [ __ ] result

---------00:16----------
that shows up is a bulgarian website see

---------00:19----------
that's what that's what i get though

---------00:20----------
from making myself for making that

---------00:22----------
goddamn video about google yesterday i

---------00:24----------
make a video about google and they made

---------00:26----------
me look like a [ __ ] idiot so for

---------00:28----------
those of you who are wondering I had

---------00:30----------
someone message me that said I am

---------00:32----------
looking for a macbook repair i am in

---------00:34----------
belgium do you know anybody and i

---------00:37----------
actually had a student a long time ago

---------00:39----------
from belgium but i forgot the exact name

---------00:42----------
of his website so i figured let me

---------00:43----------
Google so I googled macbook logic board

---------00:46----------
repair Belgium and I click on a bunch of

---------00:48----------
sites and the first one that showed up

---------00:51----------
like okay this looks a little familiar

---------00:53----------
fine whatever you copy the theme who

---------00:55----------
gives a [ __ ] like really who gives a

---------00:56----------
[ __ ] and like you straight up copied and

---------00:59----------
pasted my entire [ __ ] website it's not

---------01:03----------
like everything all of it and I'm not

---------01:07----------
one of those people that goes over

---------01:08----------
copyright and all that and says you used

---------01:10----------
a piece of my content like I'm not I'm

---------01:12----------
not gonna submit a copy that says [ __ ]

---------01:14----------
that's a [ __ ] waste of my time but I

---------01:16----------
think it's just I think it is a lame

---------01:20----------
thing to do for sure it's kind of like

---------01:22----------
what Roger Waters did when he figured

---------01:25----------
out that Andrew Lloyd Webber plagiarized

---------01:27----------
Phantom of the Opera from his echoes you

---------01:30----------
know he didn't sue Andrew Lloyd Webber

---------01:33----------
he just made a song in 1992 about a

---------01:36----------
piano that breaking his fingers you know

---------01:37----------
it's one of those things like I'm not

---------01:39----------
the type of person that's going on

---------01:40----------
that's gonna actually submit a [ __ ]

---------01:43----------
copyright complaint or any of that

---------01:44----------
horseshit it's just like what if you're

---------01:48----------
making a website right make a website

---------01:51----------
that tells me why I should use you what

---------01:55----------
makes you special what sets you apart

---------01:57----------
what you believe like type that [ __ ]

---------02:00----------
that that's dead that's your words that

---------02:02----------
that's your thoughts that's your ideas

---------02:04----------
that which that's what inspired you to

---------02:05----------
start a business you do you know type

---------02:07----------
you and someone said like you know the

---------02:10----------
guy typed that he admires you or

---------02:12----------
whatever and there

---------02:13----------
I don't care copy the failsafe it's not

---------02:17----------
even a business thing because I

---------02:19----------
explicitly tell people with

---------02:21----------
international dinner for international

---------02:23----------
stuff don't send it to me you're better

---------02:26----------
off finding someone in your country do

---------02:28----------
not deal with customs do not deal with

---------02:30----------
the expense of shipping back and forth

---------02:33----------
find someone your country it's not even

---------02:35----------
a stealing business thing it's just kind

---------02:36----------
of lame you know and yeah the other lame

---------02:38----------
thing is that I go Google got me there

---------02:40----------
they straight up

---------02:41----------
I didn't bother checking the address on

---------02:45----------
the website to see that it's Bulgaria I

---------02:47----------
figured that if I Google MacBook logic

---------02:49----------
board repair Belgium that the first

---------02:51----------
result that shows up on Google would

---------02:53----------
actually be in [ __ ] Belgium but then

---------02:55----------
again we're talking about a website that

---------02:56----------
allows DIC pill ads and human

---------02:58----------
trafficking ads but will not allow ads

---------03:00----------
for repair so what like oh clearly I put

---------03:04----------
a little bit more trust into Google than

---------03:06----------
I should be yeah I actually typed in the

---------03:09----------
end it's like give like a Belgium's

---------03:12----------
it must be Belgium's taxes are too high

---------03:14----------
you can't afford to hire a writer tongue

---------03:17----------
in cheek and it's like yeah it's in

---------03:18----------
Bulgaria yeah aren't you a [ __ ]

---------03:20----------
dumbass Lewis because I actually did

---------03:21----------
wind up looking it up in in my scheduler

---------03:24----------
and finding my students website and I

---------03:28----------
referred this customer to my old student

---------03:32----------
who was in Belgium because I you know

---------03:35----------
he's smart guy but yeah that was funny

---------03:39----------
all around that was funny all around

---------03:44----------
okay so what's wrong with this MacBook

---------03:50----------
so I'm gonna turn on my power supply

---------03:52----------
let's attach my power supply software

---------03:55----------
get that showing up on the screen do you

---------03:58----------
fix magic Mouse's I do not fix mice man

---------04:00----------
you kick you can buy a mouse online for

---------04:02----------
like 20 bucks I don't fix mice if you

---------04:06----------
can buy something for less than the cost

---------04:08----------
of lunch in New York City I don't fix it

---------04:10----------
I'll put it that way

---------04:12----------
- that [ __ ] over the table and if that

---------04:13----------
doesn't fix it then it's out the door

---------04:15----------
all right you got 18 milliamp so we got

---------04:17----------
no green light see that 18 million or

---------04:21----------
green light let's take the board out and

---------04:23----------
see what's going on with this MacBook

---------04:25----------
as Erica would call it she likes to see

---------04:27----------
me look she never says MacBook it's Emmy

---------04:31----------
she look at me and go I love my MacBook

---------04:37----------
kevro says taxation is theft

---------04:40----------
really extreme most of the time looks

---------04:43----------
like a lot of your videos the main

---------04:44----------
channel extreme recordings but I can't

---------04:45----------
find them on Twitter YouTube I stream to

---------04:49----------
this live channel on YouTube and every

---------04:51----------
now and then I will stream to twitch 1

---------04:53----------
restream that I always working but over

---------04:55----------
the past month 3 streamed IO has been

---------04:57----------
kind of up and down so the videos you

---------05:01----------
see on the main channel are edited

---------05:03----------
versions of live streams but it usually

---------05:07----------
takes me a while to get around to

---------05:08----------
editing them or to have hi-hi edit them

---------05:10----------
so you there's about probably a month

---------05:12----------
delay and what I try to trim as much of

---------05:15----------
the fat out of the stuff that I posted

---------05:18----------
the main channel as humanly possible I

---------05:19----------
have the main channel this channel split

---------05:21----------
because a lot of people said they do not

---------05:24----------
want to be there to watch you know an

---------05:26----------
hour and a half of me digging around or

---------05:28----------
speaking a chatter the stuff that

---------05:30----------
doesn't work first thing we have to do

---------05:32----------
when looking at a board like this that

---------05:34----------
has so much corrosion in so many areas

---------05:36----------
is we need to figure out what corrosion

---------05:39----------
is the relevant corrosion so this

---------05:41----------
doesn't have a green light in the

---------05:42----------
charger right so if I go through this

---------05:45----------
board you're gonna see multiple areas on

---------05:47----------
it are corroded we have and these areas

---------05:50----------
are all for different things now if

---------05:53----------
you're starting on this on this video is

---------05:56----------
one of your the first board to pair

---------05:57----------
videos you've watched for me

---------05:58----------
you really shouldn't because I'm not

---------05:59----------
gonna go over everything as in-depth as

---------06:02----------
usual I'm going to assume that you have

---------06:03----------
some prior knowledge which I usually

---------06:05----------
don't do when I think part of what makes

---------06:06----------
me a decent teacher so the first thing

---------06:08----------
we need to do is figure out what's

---------06:09----------
relevant so this is a we have a missing

---------06:11----------
green light right so the missing green

---------06:13----------
light so let's go over everything yeah

---------06:15----------
so we have thunderbolt and USB area has

---------06:19----------
corrosion do I care about Thunderbolt no

---------06:21----------
it doesn't turn on why would I care

---------06:22----------
about Thunderbolt that's a waste

---------06:24----------
we have corrosion over here by the

---------06:26----------
backlight circuit I care about backlight

---------06:27----------
doesn't turn on no corrosion by the BIOS

---------06:31----------
if it's not turning on once we fix the

---------06:33----------
green light issue I'll be concerned

---------06:34----------
about that corrosion by the is all 6259

---------06:39----------
that's something to be concerned about

---------06:40----------
because that deals with the charger

---------06:42----------
corrosion by the SMC absolutely

---------06:45----------
important because this is this chip is

---------06:47----------
going to speak to the charger to get us

---------06:49----------
a green light this chip over here this

---------06:51----------
is the SOC reset l yeah so let's be

---------06:57----------
honest you never care about thunder but

---------06:59----------
they don't I don't but yeah this is the

---------07:04----------
SMC reset L chip this is gonna turn the

---------07:06----------
SMC on do I care about this very much so

---------07:09----------
we are going to start working on the

---------07:11----------
sections that are we're gonna work on

---------07:13----------
this in order

---------07:14----------
so before Thunderbolt turns on you need

---------07:16----------
to get a green light for the computer to

---------07:17----------
turn off and before the computer can

---------07:19----------
turn on and each have a [ __ ] green

---------07:20----------
light and the charger so the charge is

---------07:21----------
activated so we're gonna focus in the

---------07:22----------
corrosion that is closest to the areas

---------07:25----------
that I need fixed because if those

---------07:27----------
things are not fixable then focusing on

---------07:28----------
the rest is a waste of my time so let's

---------07:30----------
see what we can do there

---------07:36----------
let's be honest you never care about

---------07:38----------
thunderbolt

---------07:44----------
amen never claimed I did never claimed I

---------07:48----------
did guilty as charged

---------08:15----------
your student in Western Florida fix my

---------08:17----------
map approach 2011 who is fixing MacBook

---------08:21----------
Pro 2011 tell me who he is so I can go

---------08:24----------
down there and toss him in a river my

---------08:29----------
map it probably 2013-15 jewelers many on

---------08:33----------
charge light is on but Orange even

---------08:34----------
though battery is connected that is

---------08:36----------
totally normal on all of the retina

---------08:38----------
machines the charger light turns on even

---------08:39----------
when there's no battery connected same

---------08:41----------
for the I think the same for just about

---------08:43----------
any Mac save to device I believe now

---------08:47----------
walk-ins are picking up and I am not

---------08:48----------
removing the wood because when they find

---------08:51----------
some technicality to let Derek Shelvin

---------08:53----------
go like oh the guy was already oh the

---------08:57----------
guy was on drugs or oh the guy had a you

---------09:00----------
know he already had heart issues and all

---------09:03----------
that other stuff well once they find a

---------09:05----------
technicality to let him go the world is

---------09:06----------
going to burn and when the world does

---------09:08----------
burn I would like at the very least for

---------09:10----------
my store to be mildly covered cuz I how

---------09:15----------
far can you live away from New York

---------09:16----------
without a car that depends on what type

---------09:19----------
of motor you have on your electric bike

---------09:21----------
and what your personal tolerances

---------09:31----------
someone says Thunderbolt is a pile of

---------09:34----------
[ __ ] kind of yeah what what could be the

---------09:39----------
problem that's so to be an [ __ ]

---------09:42----------
that's kind of like saying my car

---------09:44----------
doesn't start what's wrong with it

---------09:47----------
like I don't I don't know no I got about

---------09:52----------
a thousand videos out there that are

---------09:54----------
dedicated to showing you what it is that

---------09:57----------
you need to measure that you need to

---------09:58----------
look at so that you can figure that out

---------10:01----------
for like me for me figuring that out

---------10:03----------
right now my god I don't know I will

---------10:07----------
throw you an answer it is a component

---------10:10----------
probably a component no really I have no

---------10:13----------
idea I I have there's no information

---------10:16----------
there how many answers are taking I

---------10:18----------
don't know what voltages BP brush d3 HOD

---------10:21----------
I don't know it's p.m. sleep best for

---------10:22----------
all there I don't know I don't know my

---------10:27----------
psychic

---------10:28----------
do you need a burrito I can't get a

---------10:31----------
burrito those Toros has been closed for

---------10:34----------
weeks

---------10:35----------
can't even get a burrito people wonder

---------10:39----------
why I'm angry all right give the SMC a

---------10:47----------
mild reflow is your hardtail ebike

---------10:51----------
comfortable on new york city roads

---------10:57----------
am I happy paying a $20,000 a year

---------10:59----------
property tax is the Blasio a good mayor

---------11:04----------
is Cuomo a good governor does the NYPD

---------11:10----------
have a quality relationship with

---------11:12----------
minority communities in New York City

---------11:16----------
this Apple support right to repair this

---------11:23----------
Donald Trump put thought and effort into

---------11:25----------
his tweets does Joe Biden have all of

---------11:33----------
his marbles

---------11:36----------
our Fox and MSNBC unbiased

---------11:45----------
our East scooters superior to e-bikes

---------11:55----------
you see how I worked your donation

---------11:56----------
message into my rant there I hate these

---------12:01----------
scooters because they always go right

---------12:04----------
they always cut right in front of me and

---------12:06----------
then go at nineteen point nine miles an

---------12:08----------
hour but like actual nineteen point nine

---------12:10----------
not my nineteen point nine its man if

---------12:13----------
you're going to get if you're gonna cut

---------12:15----------
in front of me go my speed or go the

---------12:16----------
[ __ ] home I just pulled an Eli you know

---------12:25----------
what indeed I did indeed I did

---------12:43----------
are the average prices for lunch in New

---------12:45----------
York burgers / noodle boxes it's not

---------12:49----------
much beer something towards today's

---------12:50----------
lunch thank you very much mr. Marty

---------12:52----------
South if I wanted to get a delivery of

---------12:56----------
that burrito rather than pick it up I'm

---------12:58----------
not kidding you that place was like 30

---------12:59----------
[ __ ] dollars which is crazy that is

---------13:01----------
insane

---------13:02----------
they have a twenty dollar minimum but

---------13:04----------
then they have a four or five dollar

---------13:06----------
delivery fee and there is sales tax on

---------13:08----------
top of it so that by the time you get to

---------13:11----------
the brie though it's like 27 to 28 bucks

---------13:14----------
and then they want a tip so I usually

---------13:18----------
don't order the burrito

---------13:19----------
it's very rare if I ever do that I will

---------13:21----------
go and pick it up in person because

---------13:24----------
there's very there's no burrito on

---------13:26----------
planet earth that is worth $30 it does

---------13:30----------
it just know it doesn't exist my East

---------13:33----------
guta goes 40 miles an hour you know the

---------13:35----------
East I've tried to eat scooter before

---------13:37----------
and here's the thing I've been riding a

---------13:39----------
bicycle since I was 5 years old before

---------13:42----------
that I was riding a tricycle I think I

---------13:44----------
had my training wheels taken off when I

---------13:46----------
was about yeah I was about six and a

---------13:49----------
half years old when I had my training

---------13:50----------
wheels taken off with my bicycle so I

---------13:52----------
have a lot of experience with riding a

---------13:54----------
bike and so far knock on wood as I

---------13:57----------
dragged the parlor Leo today I've never

---------13:59----------
had avid Estrin it Paul's great surprise

---------14:02----------
so I'm really used to riding bicycle but

---------14:06----------
I am not used to riding a scooter I had

---------14:09----------
one of those little shitty razor

---------14:10----------
scooters that you could get from Toys R

---------14:11----------
Us for like 80 bucks back in the day

---------14:13----------
remember those remember the razor

---------14:14----------
scooter so I had one of those but it

---------14:17----------
wasn't really a scooter that I had I put

---------14:22----------
this it wasn't I wasn't going anywhere

---------14:24----------
near these types of speeds on it so I'd

---------14:27----------
have to kind of redo my framework for

---------14:29----------
what I'm comfortable with and relearn it

---------14:31----------
from scratch and I don't see where

---------14:32----------
there's a benefit in it because I don't

---------14:34----------
see where how the scooter is better than

---------14:37----------
the bicycle

---------14:40----------
especially if we're talking about long

---------14:42----------
distances like we're talking about going

---------14:44----------
20 or 30 miles I don't on a regular

---------14:47----------
basis no way in oma burritos were $30

---------14:53----------
yeah it's not it's that that's insanity

---------14:57----------
Sean Hannity

---------15:12----------
my cap flew and there's a strange liquid

---------15:15----------
that it sprayed up

---------15:24----------
maybe it's just excited to see you all

---------15:28----------
right now that is l6 two five nine since

---------15:30----------
that handles a high voltage and also

---------15:32----------
speaks with the SMC we are not going to

---------15:36----------
reuse that screw that because that could

---------15:38----------
send 18 volts to my SMC Sam you know I'm

---------15:42----------
not familiar with what he does and I'm

---------15:44----------
honestly not here's the thing I think

---------15:46----------
that if you're interviewing someone it

---------15:48----------
should be because you have a you express

---------15:50----------
a genuine interest in understanding on

---------15:51----------
what they do and I don't know who that

---------15:53----------
person is so if you know that person and

---------15:58----------
understand what they do innately and

---------16:00----------
have questions you would be able to do

---------16:02----------
an excellent interview whereas if I were

---------16:04----------
to do an interview it would probably

---------16:05----------
sound forced and not very interesting

---------16:08----------
because tip should not be used to

---------16:11----------
subsidize substandard wages

---------16:13----------
come on says

---------16:19----------
I think a big part of that is that it's

---------16:23----------
a way for businesses to try and figure

---------16:25----------
out how to lower one of their largest

---------16:29----------
costs in an industry where for lack of a

---------16:34----------
better way to put it I'm trying to find

---------16:35----------
a way to say this where I don't sound

---------16:36----------
like an idiot but I know I'm gonna sound

---------16:38----------
like an idiot this is the live chat not

---------16:39----------
the main one hi how you can edit this

---------16:41----------
out right so how about this

---------16:46----------
restaurants are one of those businesses

---------16:48----------
where it's ridiculously easy to lose all

---------16:51----------
of your money and go out of business and

---------16:52----------
like a lot of the restaurants that you

---------16:54----------
see that you think are profitable are

---------16:55----------
not actually profitable so this is a way

---------16:57----------
of hedging their bets where if the

---------17:00----------
restaurant is successful the employees

---------17:02----------
will make you know a [ __ ] ton of money

---------17:03----------
and you can get your four hundred bucks

---------17:07----------
a night or so in tips and if the

---------17:09----------
restaurant is not successful then

---------17:11----------
they're not as [ __ ] as they would be

---------17:14----------
otherwise whether or not this is a good

---------17:16----------
thing or not that is for all of you to

---------17:18----------
argue but in New York City having a

---------17:24----------
restaurant is an absolute [ __ ]

---------17:26----------
the rents that you will be charged is

---------17:27----------
gonna be virtually double on any space

---------17:30----------
even if it's about the same size like

---------17:31----------
from my old store I was paying I think

---------17:33----------
3,500 when I first got it at the exact

---------17:35----------
same time that the tenant next door was

---------17:37----------
paying about 6500 for the exact same

---------17:39----------
size [ __ ] space same general layout

---------17:42----------
it's just he was using it for food and I

---------17:44----------
wasn't there's it is a lot there's a lot

---------17:49----------
of red tape in New York City to open a

---------17:51----------
restaurant the rent is insane the cost

---------17:53----------
of living is insane all this [ __ ] is

---------17:55----------
insane and I mean none of that shit's

---------17:59----------
gonna get any better from kovat it's

---------18:00----------
just you know instead of having a low

---------18:02----------
wage that's subsidized by tips you're

---------18:05----------
now going to have no wage subsidized by

---------18:07----------
I don't know

---------18:12----------
Cuomo taxing the rest of us more

---------18:14----------
probably

---------18:17----------
but the other thing with restaurants is

---------18:19----------
that a lot of restaurants sleep is it

---------18:22----------
really your fault that they stock it

---------18:24----------
running a business kind of thing you

---------18:27----------
know I'm sympathetic to that argument to

---------18:28----------
an extent because I've had people say

---------18:29----------
you know if you can't afford this then

---------18:32----------
you should not be running a business and

---------18:39----------
it's it's it's not like it's kind of

---------18:41----------
annoying to hear that because when I

---------18:44----------
started my business I could not afford

---------18:46----------
jack-shit

---------18:47----------
I remember my one of my best friend's

---------18:50----------
Jake and I haven't spoken him in a while

---------18:52----------
I've actually been a really shitty

---------18:53----------
friend there I'm sorry Jake is listening

---------18:55----------
to this like I got to start being i jake

---------18:58----------
is kind of like me in that regard that

---------19:00----------
he's bad at keeping up with people when

---------19:02----------
he gets very busy and i'm very bad at

---------19:04----------
keeping up with people when i get very

---------19:06----------
busy we both get very tunnel visioned

---------19:07----------
and i'll work and i trying to keep up in

---------19:09----------
our individual hamster wheels but I

---------19:11----------
remember offering him I think a chicken

---------19:14----------
roll from Amadeus pizza back when I was

---------19:16----------
too broke to actually hire people and

---------19:18----------
pay them properly to help me with

---------19:20----------
shipping and I remember at that point in

---------19:22----------
time Jake was broke enough that he was

---------19:24----------
willing to be paid for his work in time

---------19:27----------
with and hungry with a chicken roll from

---------19:30----------
Amadeus Pizza on 30th Street so you know

---------19:34----------
now if I'm not allowed to hire someone

---------19:37----------
for a chicken role that means no chicken

---------19:38----------
role for Jake and if I'm not allowed to

---------19:42----------
have a business then I'm not you know

---------19:43----------
I'm not gonna have the thing that

---------19:44----------
eventually grows into this stream has

---------19:48----------
dropped off yeah speak to Susan Wojcicki

---------19:52----------
about that she will have she'll help you

---------19:55----------
out with that Susan Wojcicki will help

---------19:57----------
you out with that yeah one sec let me

---------19:59----------
just give you a personal phone number

---------20:01----------
see I remember like I remember being

---------20:04----------
behind on shipping this one day because

---------20:06----------
I had to write out everything manually

---------20:08----------
and the electricity had been turned off

---------20:10----------
in the building that I was in or at

---------20:12----------
least on the floor of the building that

---------20:13----------
I was in and so I needed everything done

---------20:16----------
quickly and I was broke like I often was

---------20:19----------
in the first year or two out of my

---------20:20----------
business my friend was also broke

---------20:22----------
because he couldn't do any [ __ ]

---------20:24----------
recording sessions because they didn't

---------20:25----------
have any electricity

---------20:28----------
I need to get everything done quickly I

---------20:30----------
had no money left and I said you know

---------20:31----------
help me wish you know you helped me with

---------20:33----------
the shipping I'll get you a chicken roll

---------20:35----------
from Amadeus and that was my first

---------20:37----------
employer right there

---------20:38----------
that was my first employee right there

---------20:41----------
throat people helping each other out

---------20:50----------
shoutout to Jake from Space Lab

---------20:52----------
recordings if he's watching this now

---------20:58----------
those are the [ __ ] days remember

---------21:03----------
working at a studio one by a cokehead

---------21:05----------
Jake remember that you remember that

---------21:07----------
remember oh man the [ __ ] that we both

---------21:14----------
went through to get where we are right

---------21:15----------
now [ __ ] that we both dealt with to get

---------21:21----------
where we are right now

---------22:06----------
[Music]

---------22:16----------
I get where people are coming from with

---------22:17----------
the argument that if you can't pay a

---------22:18----------
decent wage or you should that that you

---------22:20----------
shouldn't your job which shouldn't exist

---------22:22----------
but at the same time isn't something

---------22:26----------
better than nothing something is better

---------22:30----------
than nothing

---------22:31----------
I think the aggravation is not out of

---------22:33----------
that it's it's when people who clearly

---------22:36----------
have the means to do things like I don't

---------22:39----------
even mean you know mildly successful but

---------22:41----------
when people who are above and beyond

---------22:43----------
successful go out of their way to make

---------22:45----------
sure that you get the shittiest amount

---------22:47----------
possible like that that's what I think

---------22:49----------
that's where that type of rhetoric comes

---------22:50----------
from and I understand it but that what

---------22:55----------
it pisses me off when people go you

---------22:56----------
can't afford X or if you can't do that

---------22:58----------
you don't deserve to have a business

---------22:59----------
it's like [ __ ] you you just try starting

---------23:02----------
some [ __ ] from scratch see where you

---------23:04----------
with no money and no bank that wants the

---------23:07----------
finance you are no loan or anything

---------23:08----------
let's see what you do something beats

---------23:12----------
nothing

---------23:27----------
and like there's a lot of stuff that I

---------23:29----------
don't actually do because I know I would

---------23:31----------
not be able to afford to pay people

---------23:33----------
properly to be able to head of it but

---------23:35----------
there are certain services that I don't

---------23:37----------
offer because there's no way in hell

---------23:39----------
that I would be able to pay someone

---------23:40----------
something that is acceptable to do it

---------23:42----------
like when people will say why don't you

---------23:44----------
work on this I go you know it's too old

---------23:46----------
well and they'll get really [ __ ]

---------23:47----------
offended but if we say it's too old you

---------23:49----------
have to explain it and you know a

---------23:51----------
customer ball coddling ball tickling

---------23:53----------
kind of way that they don't want Staryu

---------23:55----------
but if you give me a device to work on

---------23:58----------
that is worth forty seven dollars I need

---------24:01----------
to charge you about thirty percent of

---------24:03----------
what the device is worth max so that

---------24:05----------
you'll want to fix it maybe fifty

---------24:06----------
percent so that gives me a budget of $20

---------24:08----------
so that means that the person who's

---------24:10----------
working on the device now keep in mind

---------24:12----------
we have a business when you have all the

---------24:14----------
overhead and all the other expenses of

---------24:15----------
running a business that means that you

---------24:17----------
you're gonna have to pay the employee

---------24:20----------
somewhere between 1/3 to 1/4 or so what

---------24:25----------
it is you charge the customer so oK

---------24:28----------
we've got we've already worked out that

---------24:30----------
we have about a 10 or 15 dollar budget

---------24:32----------
to fix this thing which means I got to

---------24:34----------
pay the employee about seven five to ten

---------24:36----------
dollars to fix it what they don't

---------24:40----------
realize is that the demand for that

---------24:42----------
salary to be low is not even directly

---------24:45----------
coming from the employer the employer is

---------24:47----------
just to being a middleman for the

---------24:48----------
customer there because the customer is

---------24:50----------
asking you to do so the customer is

---------24:51----------
essentially telling you fix my problem

---------24:54----------
for five or ten bucks when they bring

---------24:56----------
you a forty seven dollar device and say

---------24:58----------
fix it what they're saying is I

---------25:00----------
whoever's working on this is good I want

---------25:03----------
I need them to fix it for seven to ten

---------25:04----------
bucks and if it's a problem that is a

---------25:07----------
good chance of taking half an hour to an

---------25:08----------
hour well now you have a situation

---------25:11----------
whereby the person working on it would

---------25:13----------
have to be making [ __ ] seven or ten

---------25:15----------
bucks an hour probably less because

---------25:17----------
again there's going to be devices that

---------25:19----------
are not always fixable remember this is

---------25:22----------
a very this is a no fix No Fee business

---------25:27----------
but this is where things become

---------25:29----------
complicated

---------25:32----------
this is where things start to become

---------25:34----------
complicated where are things that sound

---------25:39----------
good where things that's you know where

---------25:42----------
a rhetoric that sounds fair and sounds

---------25:45----------
righteous wines have kind of fallen

---------25:46----------
apart so what I do as a business is I

---------25:52----------
just I find ways to say no to all this

---------25:55----------
[ __ ] that's gonna fall into that area

---------25:56----------
where in order to do it properly I would

---------26:01----------
have to under pay someone or rip you off

---------26:06----------
because here's the way I see it even if

---------26:09----------
I could actually find someone who's

---------26:11----------
willing to work for seven or ten bucks

---------26:12----------
an hour doing border pair let's say you

---------26:15----------
find someone that's willing to do that

---------26:17----------
how [ __ ] good are they going to be

---------26:19----------
they're gonna suck because the people

---------26:21----------
who were actually good at that job we're

---------26:23----------
gonna gets you know taken by someone

---------26:25----------
else like a lot of the people that I

---------26:27----------
have here that are employees that are

---------26:29----------
good I stole from someone that was under

---------26:31----------
paying them by the way this guy said

---------26:33----------
before it stopped turning on his sleep

---------26:35----------
was not working and you notice that we

---------26:36----------
have corrosion in our Hall sensor area

---------26:40----------
now it is economical to repair if

---------26:43----------
someone else is willing to work for Less

---------26:44----------
and here's where I direct you to the

---------26:47----------
free market yes that Evo free market go

---------26:50----------
on ebay right now search for like iPad

---------26:53----------
backlight fuse or [ __ ] like that you

---------26:56----------
will see $15 including shipping that

---------27:00----------
people not companies people are

---------27:03----------
volunteering to work below minimum wage

---------27:07----------
absolute [ __ ] insanity the shipping

---------27:11----------
the time to make the listing the time to

---------27:14----------
deal with the customer the time to

---------27:16----------
package it the time to open the [ __ ]

---------27:18----------
iPad close the [ __ ] iPad properly all

---------27:21----------
this [ __ ] 15 damn dollars at the end of

---------27:29----------
the day once you legislate that a

---------27:32----------
company can't pay a slave wage you'll

---------27:34----------
find people going on eBay and

---------27:37----------
she was enough fricken pay themselves

---------27:38----------
slave wages it said it really is I

---------27:41----------
remember back in 2011 when I was able to

---------27:45----------
undercut everyone on eBay in order to

---------27:48----------
get higher sales volume by offering

---------27:51----------
logic board repair for 159 now if you

---------27:54----------
offer a logical order pair on eBay for

---------27:56----------
159 you're probably considered part of

---------27:58----------
an aristocracy or something

---------28:07----------
unready find so many people posting

---------28:09----------
about entitled people wanting to pay

---------28:10----------
less than minimum wage for people to

---------28:11----------
watch their kids with experience I

---------28:13----------
wonder what people are attracted to

---------28:14----------
those offers and if I wanted those

---------28:15----------
people to close to my kids

---------28:33----------
but yet for me if you're personally

---------28:36----------
willing to work for like 7 or 10 bucks

---------28:38----------
an hour and do this job my concern at

---------28:42----------
that point is are you qualified like are

---------28:47----------
you actually going to do it

---------28:53----------
because greed goes both ways you know a

---------28:56----------
lot of people say that I am NOT greedy

---------28:58----------
because I pay people a better salary

---------29:00----------
than most other companies in the

---------29:02----------
industry in our little section of you

---------29:04----------
know consumer electronics repair some

---------29:05----------
burrito money for you thanks for the

---------29:07----------
content thank you come on but I'm not

---------29:09----------
I'm just greedy in the other direction

---------29:11----------
it's just people have this tendency to

---------29:12----------
paint me out to be so much nicer than I

---------29:14----------
am which I always push back against I

---------29:18----------
want the ability to demand the quality I

---------29:21----------
have high expectations I just happened

---------29:27----------
to

---------29:31----------
what I expect and demand of the people

---------29:33----------
that work here is quite a bit

---------29:48----------
but yeah when someone says like you know

---------29:50----------
if this is not when someone says you

---------29:54----------
can't pay someone this little to do this

---------29:57----------
then you have to keep in mind that there

---------29:59----------
is it's not just the employer it's the

---------30:00----------
customer who walks in the door with the

---------30:02----------
$47 device who doesn't want to pay $47

---------30:05----------
for another $47 device who then wants

---------30:07----------
you to perform open-ended

---------30:08----------
troubleshooting that there's more

---------30:11----------
involved in that transaction than you

---------30:12----------
see because they may not know that

---------30:18----------
that's what they're asking but that's

---------30:19----------
what they're asking

---------30:22----------
yeah they don't actually know that it's

---------30:24----------
gonna be that much of an issue but you

---------30:26----------
know

---------30:53----------
minimum wage tackles the issue from

---------30:55----------
wrong end issue is cost of living in

---------30:57----------
many areas like rendered politicians

---------30:59----------
that failed at resolving yeah you make a

---------31:04----------
point there because even if you make

---------31:06----------
minimum wage fifteen bucks an hour in

---------31:08----------
New York City who cares seriously who

---------31:10----------
cares you know I'm looking at houses and

---------31:15----------
I need to live all the way up at the end

---------31:18----------
of the city in order for a house to be

---------31:20----------
only seven hundred twenty thousand

---------31:22----------
dollars if your rent is 2,000 or 3,000 a

---------31:26----------
month okay you make fifteen bucks an

---------31:27----------
hour big [ __ ] look you know doesn't

---------31:29----------
really do anything now it's not gonna

---------31:32----------
solve anything

---------31:32----------
by the time we get a $15 an hour minimum

---------31:35----------
wage you're gonna need 30

---------31:45----------
my issue with minimum wage law right now

---------31:48----------
is that there is not a corresponding

---------31:52----------
piece of legislation regarding

---------31:54----------
internships that seem satisfactory to me

---------31:57----------
in order to be an intern you either need

---------31:59----------
to be doing it for college credit or

---------32:00----------
minimum wage and one of the ways that I

---------32:02----------
learned a lot of the stuff that I

---------32:04----------
learned here on how to deal with clients

---------32:06----------
when they're really pissed at you had it

---------32:08----------
get people to trust you how to do the

---------32:11----------
job properly he had how to heaven this

---------32:14----------
is the kind of diagnostic thought

---------32:16----------
process with electronics repair I

---------32:17----------
learned while working at a place called

---------32:19----------
avatar studios and I worked there for

---------32:21----------
zero dollars an hour in 2007 and then

---------32:24----------
eventually I got hired for 750 after a

---------32:26----------
three-month long internship that was was

---------32:28----------
not for college credit and it was not

---------32:31----------
for yeah no not for college credit and

---------32:34----------
it was not for money so that would have

---------32:37----------
technically been considered an illegal

---------32:39----------
internship it was not it was against

---------32:41----------
labor law however that arrangement is

---------32:43----------
the arrangement that allowed me when I

---------32:45----------
was what's you know 18 years old or so

---------32:48----------
just turned 18 I said I figured I put 17

---------32:51----------
or 18 but I was able at the time to work

---------32:54----------
with literally the best in the world you

---------32:56----------
know I got to work alongside the people

---------32:58----------
like Ricky vegan and Roy Hendrickson and

---------33:02----------
Phil Lipscomb and all these people who

---------33:04----------
were just really really good technicians

---------33:06----------
who really beat into me the you know

---------33:09----------
quality workmanship and how to do the

---------33:12----------
job and that gave me a leg up on

---------33:15----------
everybody else it allowed me to get

---------33:16----------
ahead and that place would have never

---------33:18----------
let me in the door if I was the man if I

---------33:20----------
cost money because if I had cost 15

---------33:22----------
bucks an hour 15 bucks an hour we don't

---------33:25----------
need to hire a [ __ ] idiot 17 year-old

---------33:26----------
that doesn't know anything we could get

---------33:28----------
somebody else the only way that I was

---------33:30----------
able to provide value in that situation

---------33:32----------
was the fact that for three months

---------33:34----------
straight I was willing to clean toilets

---------33:36----------
and clean phones in all this that you

---------33:40----------
know clean the ear sweat off of the

---------33:42----------
phones and clean the puke that when

---------33:45----------
musicians were throwing up all over the

---------33:47----------
roof while they were having their 30th

---------33:48----------
anniversary party that was the bargain I

---------33:51----------
don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing I am

---------33:53----------
clueless not only am i clueless in your

---------33:56----------
industry

---------33:56----------
I am 17 years old so I don't even have

---------33:59----------
tact probably gonna say [ __ ] that's

---------34:01----------
gonna get you in trouble there's a risk

---------34:03----------
of that but in exchange I will swipe

---------34:06----------
your floors and clean all this [ __ ] and

---------34:07----------
say yes sir thank you sir and get people

---------34:10----------
food and all I'm asking in return is the

---------34:13----------
ability to be around and learn and that

---------34:16----------
proposition got me where I am so for me

---------34:19----------
to be in favor of something that would

---------34:21----------
have essentially taken away my pathway

---------34:23----------
to where I am I feel like I'm betraying

---------34:25----------
my past self so there's got to be some

---------34:28----------
sort of balance if you want to have a 15

---------34:31----------
or 20 dollar minimum wage you do you but

---------34:34----------
there's got to be something in there

---------34:35----------
that allows someone like me to have

---------34:38----------
gotten where I got there has to be

---------34:41----------
something in there that allows someone

---------34:43----------
who is young uneducated unexperienced

---------34:45----------
with little to nothing to offer to be

---------34:48----------
able to walk in and make that type of

---------34:50----------
deal that I made so some sort of

---------34:53----------
reforming of the internship system may

---------34:56----------
be a reforming of the apprenticeship

---------34:57----------
system [ __ ] me that cap just flew into

---------34:59----------
the air fume extractors son of a [ __ ]

---------35:02----------
because I know there's got to be

---------35:04----------
something that keeps people from there's

---------35:07----------
got to be something there that's going

---------35:09----------
to keep employers from outright

---------35:10----------
exploiting people but at the same time

---------35:13----------
there's also got to be some way for me

---------35:15----------
to get on the bottom rung of all of a

---------35:18----------
ladder somewhere because working I got a

---------35:21----------
job working at mal Dell Sporting Goods

---------35:23----------
for six bucks an hour but that wasn't

---------35:24----------
really teaching me what I wanted to know

---------35:25----------
and places like this like I have no

---------35:28----------
reason to hire you for fifteen or twenty

---------35:30----------
bucks an hour if you don't know what

---------35:31----------
you're doing

---------35:31----------
there's no point in that there's no

---------35:34----------
reason for that and what you're gonna

---------35:37----------
wind up doing to try to get a job if you

---------35:38----------
can't get if nobody's gonna hire you at

---------35:41----------
an entry-level position you're probably

---------35:43----------
gonna go to you're probably gonna go to

---------35:44----------
some trade school and pay 30 or $40,000

---------35:47----------
to learn how to do something in the

---------35:49----------
hopes of getting a job because there's a

---------35:51----------
lot of trade schools I mean [ __ ] the

---------35:53----------
in the in the recording studio industry

---------35:55----------
oh my god there are so many rent seekers

---------35:58----------
there's a what if Full Sail FAs

---------36:02----------
II in IR there's all these [ __ ]

---------36:05----------
places that make it sound like there's

---------36:07----------
these great jobs that you can get if you

---------36:09----------
just give us ten a $40,000 first F Apple

---------36:13----------
if Adam price companies in general and F

---------36:14----------
apples BS yeah yeah there's so many

---------36:17----------
companies that are more than happy to

---------36:19----------
tell you

---------36:19----------
oh yeah just give us $40,000 and we'll

---------36:22----------
give you a little certificate that won't

---------36:24----------
get you a job but dare you get an

---------36:26----------
internship that doesn't pay you anything

---------36:28----------
for a month that's illegal

---------36:30----------
that's illegal but taking $40,000 from

---------36:33----------
someone to give them a certificate that

---------36:35----------
doesn't teach them jack [ __ ] that's okay

---------36:37----------
that's okay

---------36:42----------
ah I recently sent my 839 deed for a

---------36:49----------
pair by the Apple Store not an ASP they

---------36:51----------
charged me 334 a new top case assembly

---------36:53----------
battery and a new right-side i/o do you

---------36:56----------
think that was a reasonable repair cost

---------36:57----------
that is a [ __ ] steal that is a great

---------37:02----------
deal if you actually needed all of that

---------37:04----------
stuff that is yeah you've got they

---------37:08----------
treated you well cuz again and I'll be

---------37:10----------
I'll be real when you get treated well

---------37:12----------
or when you get treated poorly a lot of

---------37:14----------
the times Apple store treats people

---------37:15----------
poorly but what they gave you right

---------37:16----------
there that's a good deal that was

---------37:17----------
supporting you as a customer you had in

---------37:20----------
really old machine so that did not have

---------37:23----------
a known serious design flaw so there's

---------37:25----------
really no reason but then B giving you

---------37:26----------
free [ __ ] under warranty and they gave

---------37:28----------
you a very fair deal for a lot of money

---------37:30----------
I mean for a little mine I'm fine with

---------37:33----------
an internship but it should not be part

---------37:34----------
of the business model of free labor in

---------37:35----------
particular not if it does not include

---------37:37----------
the chance to get a job and make up for

---------37:38----------
the lost money it is that like places

---------37:42----------
like Avatar like you knew what they were

---------37:43----------
doing you knew what they were doing they

---------37:45----------
had a [ __ ] intern mill there for 30

---------37:47----------
years because avatar I knew that they

---------37:49----------
were a very highly coveted studio and

---------37:52----------
that there are people that would toss me

---------37:53----------
in front of the J train in his dick

---------37:55----------
would say for a chance to work there for

---------37:57----------
free and like you know they knew that

---------37:59----------
and I'm sure that they pinned to that as

---------38:01----------
much as they could

---------38:02----------
let's see if this turns on now so I

---------38:06----------
think that you know at some point there

---------38:08----------
was so much everything's a pendulum

---------38:11----------
what's your opinion on Apple moving away

---------38:12----------
from Intel I don't give a [ __ ] they can

---------38:14----------
do whatever they want I don't give a

---------38:16----------
[ __ ] I could care less I don't care I

---------38:20----------
don't care

---------38:23----------
not one bit it doesn't it's gonna be

---------38:27----------
more annoying to learn a new

---------38:28----------
architecture to fix those machines but

---------38:31----------
otherwise I don't really care it's not

---------38:33----------
high on the list for me so I think it's

---------38:37----------
kind of like a pendulum slug you know

---------38:38----------
super exploitation oh [ __ ] we need to

---------38:41----------
clamp down oh crap now there's no

---------38:43----------
opportunity oh crap now there's a bunch

---------38:45----------
of exploitation oh crap now there's no

---------38:47----------
opportunity oh yeah it's a pendulum and

---------38:49----------
I think at some point we got so far to

---------38:51----------
the exploitation section that now it's

---------38:54----------
it's gonna see it's going to

---------38:56----------
going back and forth again am I

---------38:58----------
personally said that if if a

---------39:01----------
seventeen-year-old comes to me and says

---------39:03----------
it's my last year of high school I want

---------39:05----------
to be able to learn how to do what you

---------39:07----------
do I have no idea what it is can I get

---------39:09----------
an internship with you I have to say no

---------39:10----------
yes that sucks that sucks that by doing

---------39:12----------
that by technically taking in that kid

---------39:14----------
as an intern I would be breaking the law

---------39:15----------
it makes me sick that the path to

---------39:18----------
success that I took that worked for me

---------39:20----------
is not a path that I can offer to

---------39:22----------
someone else because the visibility I

---------39:24----------
have as a business means that I cannot

---------39:26----------
do a legal [ __ ] like what avatar did

---------39:28----------
behind closed doors with those [ __ ]

---------39:30----------
shady internships and I'm also I cannot

---------39:34----------
pay you 15 or 20 bucks an hour if you

---------39:36----------
don't know anything about the business

---------39:37----------
I'm sorry I can't do it you know I'm not

---------39:40----------
I'm not [ __ ] moneybags here I don't

---------39:43----------
if you looked at the quality of homes

---------39:45----------
that I that I'm budgeting to be able to

---------39:48----------
buy you'd see I can't just hire people

---------39:51----------
willy-nilly at 15 or 20 bucks an hour

---------39:54----------
who have no ability to offer value so

---------39:57----------
what I do there is kind of a compromise

---------39:59----------
is I put out all the videos that I do in

---------40:01----------
the hopes that you can learn on your own

---------40:04----------
and then you can apply for a job here

---------40:06----------
and by the time you apply for the job

---------40:07----------
here maybe you'll have an idea how to

---------40:09----------
how to work on this stuff and you

---------40:11----------
actually will be worth the amount of

---------40:13----------
money that I am mandated to pay but yeah

---------40:16----------
I think it's not it's not a personal

---------40:20----------
thing it's not a me saying you're not

---------40:22----------
worth this as a person it's just to this

---------40:25----------
business you're not worth much like as a

---------40:26----------
home inspector

---------40:27----------
I'm not worth minimum wage as a home

---------40:30----------
inspector I'm actually worth negative I

---------40:31----------
will cost you money because I'm a

---------40:33----------
[ __ ] idiot in that regard you know

---------40:35----------
there's a so if someone comes here and

---------40:37----------
says I want to learn I don't know

---------40:38----------
anything I don't have anything to offer

---------40:39----------
you like what do I do it's it's a

---------40:42----------
difficult thing okay let's see what this

---------40:46----------
is taking at a curiosity I've been

---------40:48----------
talking away too much so it looks like

---------40:51----------
we're taking 500 milliamps here and it

---------40:54----------
looks like the fan is spinning as it

---------40:55----------
always does because I'm awesome and

---------40:57----------
amazing and great and the best ever

---------41:02----------
totally unbiased there let's see if you

---------41:04----------
have a backlight in the screen if we do

---------41:05----------
I'm gonna be putting this through an

---------41:06----------
ultrasonic cleaner perhaps giving it one

---------41:08----------
second pass through just to make sure

---------41:10----------
that there's nothing nasty that got

---------41:12----------
missed you always want to do that yeah

---------41:16----------
for me what I've done to eliminate my

---------41:20----------
aggravation with that issue is I just

---------41:22----------
put I put as much out there as I can for

---------41:25----------
free so that people can learn and

---------41:27----------
hopefully you're able to make something

---------41:29----------
of that but yeah that's the other thing

---------41:32----------
interns it's not even that it's like

---------41:34----------
free labor interns cost you money

---------41:35----------
because interns are gonna the thing is

---------41:37----------
if interns are gonna do stupid [ __ ] I

---------41:39----------
know the [ __ ] that I did as an intern I

---------41:41----------
know the stuff that my other interns did

---------41:43----------
when they were interns interns do stupid

---------41:45----------
[ __ ] they they do things that will cost

---------41:48----------
you money they're gonna say things the

---------41:50----------
customers that are gonna cost you money

---------41:51----------
they're gonna break [ __ ] while they're

---------41:53----------
learning interns cost considerable

---------41:56----------
amounts of money it's not even I mean

---------42:04----------
paying someone who's actually going to

---------42:06----------
cost me money for a good period of time

---------42:08----------
is just not something I can do

---------42:10----------
particularly especially here's the thing

---------42:11----------
there are interns that want to work to

---------42:13----------
get hired and then there are also

---------42:14----------
interns that want to work in exchange

---------42:17----------
for for knowledge to be able to build

---------42:20----------
their own place so like with recording

---------42:22----------
studios a lot of the people that

---------42:23----------
interned at these studios they weren't

---------42:25----------
even looking to get a job at the studio

---------42:26----------
they just wanted to learn so that they

---------42:27----------
could apply it to their own studio so

---------42:29----------
people will say well you're paying the

---------42:31----------
intern to learn but once they get are a

---------42:34----------
full employee then they'll work for you

---------42:35----------
a lot of people who ask for internships

---------42:38----------
are specifically asking for internships

---------42:40----------
because they want to learn how to

---------42:42----------
improve their skill sets that they can

---------42:44----------
have their own business so if you pay

---------42:46----------
the intern it's actually

---------42:47----------
counterproductive because you're

---------42:49----------
literally paying them to learn and once

---------42:51----------
they reach the point where they stop

---------42:52----------
costing you money where you can may

---------42:55----------
actually be able to recoup on the

---------42:56----------
investment they they leave which is

---------42:59----------
absolutely fine if they're working for

---------43:01----------
free that's absolutely fine if if that

---------43:03----------
is discussed and arranged upfront like I

---------43:07----------
wouldn't but it but it just makes zero

---------43:11----------
sense of the business transaction to pay

---------43:13----------
someone who has no ability to offer

---------43:16----------
value because they don't know how to do

---------43:18----------
any of what you do and after that you're

---------43:21----------
done with the two to three month

---------43:22----------
internship period like Oh

---------43:23----------
cool I learned everything thanks I'm

---------43:25----------
gonna go work for you no competitor but

---------43:28----------
I don't mind teaching people how to do

---------43:29----------
all this stuff I really don't mind

---------43:31----------
teaching people I actually I enjoy it a

---------43:33----------
lot I like seeing when people email me

---------43:35----------
pictures of their own little repair

---------43:36----------
shops they kind of styled and all that

---------43:38----------
stuff and it's just I don't want to pay

---------43:40----------
you for that process like that that's

---------43:42----------
what I know okay I've really just

---------43:46----------
repeated myself way too many times there

---------43:48----------
so I am going to plug this in and I'm

---------43:51----------
going to see if I get a picture on the

---------43:52----------
screen or smoke

---------43:53----------
hopefully not smoke except for Kevin

---------43:57----------
someone said no especially Kevin we love

---------43:59----------
Kevin here honestly Kevin went from a

---------44:02----------
person that I wanted to fire to a person

---------44:05----------
that does the job better than Steve and

---------44:08----------
I like if there was no coronavirus or

---------44:11----------
sexual harassment losses to worry about

---------44:13----------
I would go up to Kevin and give him a

---------44:14----------
bear hug he's I'm [ __ ] proud of that

---------44:16----------
guy he really he really understands

---------44:20----------
every element every subtlety of working

---------44:24----------
for us all the things that make it

---------44:25----------
difficult all the things that are how to

---------44:27----------
deal with a customer when they're

---------44:28----------
agitated how to de-escalate situations

---------44:31----------
how to arrange win-win scenarios of

---------44:34----------
people he is how to anticipate things

---------44:38----------
that will become issues before their

---------44:40----------
issues he is he has come so far and I'm

---------44:43----------
[ __ ] proud of him and I'm happy to

---------44:45----------
say that he's surpassed both Steve and I

---------44:47----------
and the ability to do that job I really

---------44:49----------
think it's awesome so shout out to Kevin

---------44:51----------
so this works this has a picture on the

---------44:53----------
screen this works that's it for today

---------44:55----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------44:57----------
something yeah yeah see you in the next

---------45:01----------
one
