---------00:00----------
hi today I'm gonna be going over a board

---------00:01----------
that was not turning on it had no power

---------00:03----------
at all and that was because CPU V core

---------00:05----------
was shorted to ground so I'm gonna go

---------00:07----------
over why I was doing that how I figured

---------00:09----------
it out and what I did to fix it and I'm

---------00:12----------
not gonna be doing this in real time

---------00:13----------
like I did with some of the other board

---------00:15----------
repairs because the other technician who

---------00:16----------
works here is out for two weeks on

---------00:18----------
surgically which means that in addition

---------00:20----------
are doing all of the board repairs from

---------00:21----------
my business all the boarder pairs for

---------00:23----------
every other business that sends me

---------00:24----------
boards I also have to fix every single

---------00:26----------
laptop that comes in for a walk-in

---------00:28----------
customer so I got my hands full for the

---------00:31----------
next two weeks but I still would like to

---------00:32----------
try to take a little bit of time out

---------00:34----------
just to be able to explain these and

---------00:35----------
just to keep the the series going as I

---------00:37----------
have so on this board again it's already

---------00:40----------
fixed what was happening was you'd get a

---------00:42----------
green light and you'd you'd see that one

---------00:45----------
point seven volts was showing up on P P

---------00:47----------
bus g3 hot but that's that's not twelve

---------00:49----------
point six you need twelve point six not

---------00:50----------
one point seven and when I put my

---------00:52----------
multimeter in diode mode what happened

---------00:54----------
is that it was shorted to ground

---------00:55----------
completely it was straight zero volts

---------00:56----------
now before I even got my short testers

---------00:59----------
power supply that I used to finding

---------01:00----------
shorts and a motherboard you could see

---------01:02----------
what I do with that in a previous video

---------01:03----------
how to find a short and a motherboard

---------01:04----------
without a $6,000 camera what I noticed

---------01:07----------
is that my CPU II think was getting hot

---------01:09----------
now the thing is the voltage was

---------01:11----------
actually being brought down the charger

---------01:12----------
assist gets kind of smart if there's a

---------01:13----------
short to ground that's not gonna keep

---------01:15----------
trying to create 12 volts into it it

---------01:16----------
lowers it to one point seven and at that

---------01:18----------
one point seven volts my heatsink was

---------01:20----------
getting hot which meant that my CPU had

---------01:22----------
something wrong with it so what I

---------01:23----------
noticed under the microscope is that

---------01:24----------
there was a little bit of corrosion in

---------01:25----------
that area now you're not still going to

---------01:27----------
be able to see any of this corrosion

---------01:28----------
because I actually I replaced the

---------01:31----------
components that were at fault and I also

---------01:34----------
ran it under the ultrasonic cleaner

---------01:37----------
after I did all of that and brushed it

---------01:39----------
all off but you could still see some red

---------01:41----------
probe points and that's going to be

---------01:42----------
what's what gives you a hint that there

---------01:44----------
was some kind of liquid damage so in

---------01:48----------
this area you could well you can't see

---------01:50----------
anything because I have light turned all

---------01:52----------
the way up there the camera doesn't like

---------01:54----------
light as much as I do yeah you could see

---------01:56----------
that there's a lot of red probe points

---------01:58----------
over here and this general vicinity

---------02:00----------
looked nasty now if this is the CPU

---------02:03----------
right down here right so I'm gonna show

---------02:06----------
you on the schematic why it is I thought

---------02:09----------
that CPU v core was the fault so let me

---------02:11----------
just open up the schematic here

---------02:13----------
and then switch over to it in open

---------02:15----------
broadcaster software so we're gonna get

---------02:19----------
come on PDF reader pretend that you're

---------02:22----------
running on a computer with SSDs and raid

---------02:23----------
zero come on just for a sec okay go go

---------02:37----------
okay so here we have the V chord circuit

---------02:40----------
now what the way this works is it takes

---------02:43----------
the power from P P bus underscore s v

---------02:46----------
underscore H s underscore computing

---------02:48----------
underscore I sense and if you want to

---------02:49----------
know what that is derived from if you

---------02:51----------
didn't know that that was derived from P

---------02:52----------
P bus g3 hot I'll show you how you can

---------02:55----------
figure that out so we got this and

---------03:03----------
alright so on the first page of the

---------03:05----------
schematic I believe I mentioned this in

---------03:06----------
the previous video it tells you what all

---------03:08----------
the power rails are well hopefully I'm

---------03:11----------
not taking my video out of Sanka

---------03:13----------
rendering this PDF like that

---------03:14----------
come on redrawing a PDF in 4k is a pain

---------03:19----------
in the ass from my computer alright so

---------03:21----------
see this pp bus g3 hot that's the power

---------03:23----------
line that's shorted to ground you have

---------03:24----------
twelve point eight and under it is this

---------03:27----------
and it says twelve point eight so it's a

---------03:29----------
derivative of this power over there now

---------03:31----------
let's go back to the page that I'm

---------03:32----------
interested in and show you what's going

---------03:34----------
on here

---------03:34----------
now I already explained in a previous

---------03:37----------
video how the CPU power circuit works

---------03:39----------
and I did that on a MacBook Air

---------03:41----------
motherboard so on this board it's not

---------03:44----------
two MOSFETs it's actually one it's two

---------03:47----------
in one so it's this this package over

---------03:49----------
here now the CPU is getting really hot

---------03:52----------
now what's going on here is instead of

---------03:54----------
this making spikes for the CPU one of

---------03:56----------
these MOSFETs has shorted so as I've

---------03:58----------
said I think of a transistor like a

---------04:00----------
variable resistor like a resistor whose

---------04:02----------
resistance you can change depending on

---------04:03----------
what you tell it so based on the signals

---------04:05----------
going here to this gate and this gate

---------04:07----------
that transistor and that little

---------04:09----------
transistor in there will decide to open

---------04:10----------
and the way this works is they open and

---------04:12----------
close open and close open and close open

---------04:13----------
and close and again I showed you this in

---------04:15----------
a previous video if you want to look

---------04:17----------
that up you can look up the air v core

---------04:18----------
video I'm gonna put it in the in the

---------04:20----------
annotations here so that you can click

---------04:21----------
it if you want to further explanation

---------04:23----------
the point is what's happened here is

---------04:24----------
instead of opening and closing opening

---------04:26----------
and closing

---------04:27----------
these has the street gotten destroyed

---------04:29----------
whether it's Q 7510 Q 7520 Q 7550

---------04:33----------
honestly I do not care one of those has

---------04:35----------
been blown and what's going on here is

---------04:37----------
instead of this only opening when the

---------04:39----------
controller tells it to its open all the

---------04:41----------
time so it's actually sending this 12

---------04:44----------
volts constantly so instead of been

---------04:45----------
sending a bunch of pulses the thing it

---------04:47----------
converted into one volt only when the

---------04:49----------
controller tells it to it's constantly

---------04:52----------
sending 12 volts in which by the way you

---------04:54----------
know it's a miracle that this

---------04:56----------
thing still has a working CPU because

---------04:57----------
again the CPU is seeing one point seven

---------05:00----------
volts instead of whatever it's supposed

---------05:01----------
to now that that's a big overclock I

---------05:03----------
yeah this is Ivy Bridge I honestly don't

---------05:05----------
know off the top of my head but if it

---------05:06----------
works on point nine and a 1/4 1.0 1.1

---------05:09----------
but why did I know one point seven volts

---------05:11----------
is way way above what this is supposed

---------05:14----------
to be working on and every time you

---------05:15----------
plugged it in and was sending that P P

---------05:17----------
bus G to be hot signal direct to the CPU

---------05:19----------
luckily the charger is a little smart

---------05:21----------
and knows to limit the power going in

---------05:22----------
here if you know if it sees that or the

---------05:24----------
P P bus g3 hot circuit is because if it

---------05:26----------
wasn't it would be sending 12 point 6

---------05:28----------
volts straight to there and that would

---------05:29----------
just be hell so one of these was shorted

---------05:32----------
to ground what not one of these

---------05:34----------
transistors was shorted so instead of it

---------05:36----------
being on all instead of it being on only

---------05:38----------
when the controller tells it to to send

---------05:40----------
those pulses it was in sending pulses

---------05:42----------
we're just sending a flat 12 volts

---------05:44----------
through so what I did is I don't

---------05:46----------
honestly don't care to figure out which

---------05:48----------
one it is again as I said these

---------05:49----------
motherboards these dead boards that I

---------05:50----------
get they they cost me like what 15 30

---------05:53----------
bucks I mean I don't care I'm gonna take

---------05:55----------
all those transistors off this is this

---------05:56----------
job's get paying 325 so you know I'm not

---------05:59----------
interested in like figuring the exact

---------06:01----------
transistor and then figuring out that

---------06:03----------
later it's another MOSFET that's

---------06:04----------
up but no anyway so I'm this this and

---------06:07----------
this then got replaced now here's a

---------06:10----------
really really important gotcha here's

---------06:12----------
something that you really got to be

---------06:13----------
aware of if you're dealing with these

---------06:15----------
type of but if you're dealing with any

---------06:17----------
type of buck regulator and one of your

---------06:19----------
the transistors in the buck regulator

---------06:20----------
dies so see this over here where it says

---------06:24----------
CPU I MVP phase this is this over here

---------06:28----------
right over here this is the gate or for

---------06:31----------
the high side MOSFET right so this is

---------06:34----------
telling this one to open this CPU I MVP

---------06:37----------
L gate this is the gate for the bottom

---------06:39----------
one so this is tell

---------06:40----------
this when to open so pretty much this

---------06:42----------
signal over here controls the resistance

---------06:45----------
of this variable resistor and this over

---------06:48----------
here controls the resistance of this

---------06:49----------
variable resistor now when this is going

---------06:53----------
like it's supposed to it's sending 12

---------06:54----------
volts through phase yeah viously it's

---------06:56----------
sending a bunch of 12 volt spikes

---------06:57----------
through phase that averages out into

---------06:59----------
about one volt and after this inductor

---------07:00----------
and the capacitors that all get smoothed

---------07:02----------
out into about a volt but when this

---------07:04----------
thing is shorted when this is shorted

---------07:06----------
and always on when it's always at no

---------07:09----------
resistance because the mosfet or the

---------07:10----------
transistor or whatever you'd like to

---------07:12----------
call it because people love to troll

---------07:13----------
when I say transistor instead of MOSFET

---------07:15----------
is is blown

---------07:16----------
then this phase over here is gonna have

---------07:18----------
12 volts permanently sent to it not 12

---------07:21----------
volt spikes that average one volt 12

---------07:22----------
volts permanently now where else does

---------07:24----------
that go to so CP UI MVP underscore phase

---------07:27----------
one watch this this is again this is

---------07:32----------
this is very very important because this

---------07:33----------
this this this is what I call part of

---------07:35----------
the rabbit hole to hell so the rabbit

---------07:36----------
hole the hell is the problem that you're

---------07:37----------
never ever gonna solve and this is that

---------07:39----------
this stuff people get themselves in some

---------07:40----------
serious so over here you see that

---------07:45----------
this is the controller for it this is

---------07:46----------
sending out the signals that tell those

---------07:48----------
transistors when to open but it also is

---------07:52----------
connected directly to that now if that

---------07:54----------
is used to being one volt and now

---------07:57----------
because a transistor blew it's 12 volts

---------08:00----------
don't you think that's going to screw

---------08:01----------
this chip a little bit it is so here's

---------08:03----------
here's how these let me explain how this

---------08:04----------
works the MOSFET died the MOSFET then

---------08:07----------
was sending 12 volts instead of sending

---------08:09----------
one since that goes directly back to the

---------08:11----------
controller now the controller that's

---------08:12----------
used to seeing one volt on that pin now

---------08:14----------
so at 12 which means that your

---------08:16----------
controller is dead so you replace the

---------08:17----------
MOSFET with a good one with a known

---------08:19----------
working one even whether it's off a dead

---------08:21----------
board or with you bought it from Mouser

---------08:22----------
comm you really think that you just

---------08:23----------
fixed your problem right wrong because

---------08:26----------
now you're gonna plug that MOSFET in

---------08:27----------
you're gonna solder that onto the board

---------08:28----------
but the dead controller trip that got

---------08:30----------
killed by the previous MOSFET is going

---------08:32----------
to tell that's a constantly be on so

---------08:34----------
even if that chip is not dead the signal

---------08:37----------
going to it is going to tell it to

---------08:38----------
always stay on to always have 12 volts

---------08:41----------
not pulses of 12 volts I mean just the

---------08:43----------
straight 12 volts so that little MOSFET

---------08:44----------
that's meant from one or two or three

---------08:46----------
volt circuit now it's 12 volts going

---------08:47----------
through it all the time which means it's

---------08:49----------
going to die then you think to yourself

---------08:51----------
you know what maybe it was the

---------08:53----------
controller after all maybe

---------08:54----------
wasn't the MOSFET I just replaced the

---------08:56----------
MOSFET so I know that a in it let me

---------08:58----------
replace the controller but your old

---------08:59----------
controller just killed your new MOSFETs

---------09:01----------
and now you're gonna put the new

---------09:02----------
controller and you're still gonna have

---------09:03----------
the same behavior this is one of those

---------09:05----------
things where if you don't know what

---------09:06----------
you're doing you could literally sit

---------09:07----------
down for 40 hours in a room just just

---------09:09----------
just wanting to cry and scream and throw

---------09:11----------
things at the wall because no matter

---------09:13----------
what you were plays it never

---------09:15----------
works the answer when he buck regulator

---------09:17----------
has any symptoms like this which it's

---------09:19----------
just directly shorted and instead of

---------09:21----------
making pulses it's just one static

---------09:23----------
voltage the only thing that you can do

---------09:25----------
here is change everything at the same

---------09:27----------
time so what I did over here and I'll

---------09:29----------
show you in them and the microscope is I

---------09:32----------
changed everything

---------09:33----------
at the same time so you shrink myself so

---------09:37----------
that you can see so this is Q 75 10 over

---------09:42----------
there

---------09:43----------
that's new that is Q 75 20 over there

---------09:49----------
that is new and yeah that capacitor got

---------09:54----------
shorted to it but apparently it's it's

---------09:57----------
it's all one plane so I get to not care

---------09:59----------
this over here is Q 75 50 that was

---------10:02----------
replaced not exactly my finest soldering

---------10:07----------
job I'll admit one of the things I've

---------10:08----------
always admitted on this channel is

---------10:09----------
everything I do is is kind of lopsided

---------10:12----------
because I don't have much in terms of

---------10:14----------
steady hands for putting anything or

---------10:16----------
placing anything but it's soldered there

---------10:18----------
well and it and I always say that I

---------10:20----------
clean these a lot of people say no you

---------10:22----------
don't you leave the mess on there but

---------10:24----------
really I actually do clean these like

---------10:25----------
after I'm done with it

---------10:26----------
it gets put in the ultrasonic cleaner it

---------10:28----------
stays in there for a little bit i

---------10:29----------
toothbrush the junk off and then it

---------10:31----------
stays in there a little more gets put in

---------10:33----------
the alcohol bath gets put in the oven

---------10:34----------
because again you don't want to send

---------10:36----------
boards back to people with flux all over

---------10:37----------
them it's just nasty

---------10:38----------
and I also replaced the buck Retton

---------10:41----------
controller I see and if you want to

---------10:43----------
troll me on you know like how not align

---------10:45----------
my soldering is you're welcome to

---------10:48----------
because again I'm not claiming to be the

---------10:51----------
best at it I am NOT a micro solder ER I

---------10:53----------
am a an electronics repair technician I

---------10:57----------
saw it or to get my job done as an

---------10:59----------
electronics repair technician I think

---------11:01----------
I'm a good electronics repair technician

---------11:03----------
but I will I will totally admit that me

---------11:05----------
Anna I'm not I'm not a soldering expert

---------11:08----------
anyway as I always say on this channel

---------11:09----------
if what I do does not work you should

---------11:11----------
not listen to me you should not follow

---------11:13----------
anything I do so the next step here

---------11:16----------
would be to prove that this thing

---------11:17----------
actually actually functions I have been

---------11:20----------
getting lazy in some of these like some

---------11:21----------
of these videos I see you know whether

---------11:22----------
it was dead or no power like I measure V

---------11:25----------
core I measure hey I show you the fan

---------11:26----------
spin and I go I'm done but I gotta I'm

---------11:30----------
gonna stop doing that even if it is kind

---------11:32----------
of busy so one of the things with this

---------11:34----------
board is when it has no CPU v core it

---------11:37----------
won't chime it will make a little when

---------11:40----------
it turns on but when it does it will

---------11:42----------
chime so now not only will you see that

---------11:45----------
it turns on you'll also be able to hear

---------11:47----------
edit Dung's

---------11:52----------
isn't that a pretty sound
