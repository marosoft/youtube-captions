---------00:00----------
and it looks like that because it's a

---------00:01----------
[ __ ] Apple product why would you

---------00:03----------
expect it to work without blowing up you

---------00:05----------
bought the wrong thing hello again how

---------00:07----------
are you all doing today so here we're

---------00:09----------
gonna be fixing a MacBook this is an a

---------00:11----------
1398 with no power and open up the

---------00:15----------
ticket the first thing we do before we

---------00:18----------
actually get started working on this

---------00:20----------
MacBook is kill its coronavirus die

---------00:23----------
corona die die corona die you know

---------00:29----------
there's gonna be a really interesting

---------00:30----------
experiments over the next couple of

---------00:32----------
weeks because if you noticed very few of

---------00:39----------
the rioters were wearing masks many

---------00:41----------
protesters were but there were also many

---------00:43----------
that were not and they were screaming

---------00:45----------
and they were very close to each other

---------00:47----------
and the difference between having a

---------00:49----------
conversation with someone and screaming

---------00:51----------
in a protest is there's a lot more

---------00:53----------
droplets when screaming so how potent is

---------00:57----------
corona virus when everybody is not

---------01:00----------
socially distancing is not wearing a

---------01:02----------
mask and is not locked down that is a

---------01:05----------
social experiments that we are about our

---------01:07----------
medical experiment perhaps yeah we were

---------01:09----------
about to see the results of over the

---------01:11----------
next few weeks because remember it takes

---------01:13----------
about two weeks for these cases to go

---------01:17----------
from being asymptomatic to symptomatic

---------01:19----------
and people who whose body doesn't

---------01:23----------
doesn't beat it before showing symptoms

---------01:25----------
so I'm very curious to see what happens

---------01:27----------
over the next two weeks you made it so

---------01:30----------
number six on the YouTube trending page

---------01:33----------
can you show me a screenshot because I

---------01:35----------
have never been YouTube trending and I

---------01:37----------
just don't believe it unless I see a

---------01:38----------
proof sorry alright so speak so let's

---------01:42----------
see what's wrong with this MacBook now

---------01:45----------
it says in the ticket device will not

---------01:47----------
turn on a charge sent to Apple to

---------01:48----------
replace the battery and Apple discovered

---------01:50----------
the logic board failed and needed

---------01:52----------
replacement or repair let's take a look

---------01:55----------
now what's going on inside of this oh we

---------01:58----------
are going to

---------01:59----------
[Music]

---------02:07----------
what the [ __ ] how there's no liquid

---------02:13----------
damage

---------02:14----------
none everybody say hi to the world's

---------02:18----------
best personal trainer in the chat Marty

---------02:20----------
dr. evil genius if any of you have been

---------02:22----------
putting on a coronavirus gut and you

---------02:25----------
live in New York City reach out to mr.

---------02:28----------
dr. evil genius if any of you have a

---------02:30----------
surgeon that suggests that a five to six

---------02:33----------
figure surgery to fix what could have

---------02:35----------
been fixed with some basic exercise

---------02:38----------
he's also worth a shout out when I plug

---------02:42----------
it in I get nothing on my taking 6 MLM

---------02:45----------
so I'm not taking much I wouldn't expect

---------02:46----------
to take much because when you look at my

---------02:48----------
board my board looks like this this

---------02:54----------
Apple product just smoked itself like

---------02:56----------
this this just straight up decided you

---------02:59----------
know it's time for the barbeque

---------03:00----------
where's the barbecue I'm ready I'm ready

---------03:04----------
what does this thing do what is this for

---------03:06----------
well that's an excellent question this

---------03:08----------
board is an eight to zero - zero zero

---------03:09----------
one six three so I'm gonna open up Paul

---------03:11----------
Daniels is software and pray that

---------03:12----------
doesn't freeze and use it to open the

---------03:15----------
board view for this model board eight -

---------03:19----------
zero - zero zero one six three someone

---------03:26----------
says you do have a right to protect your

---------03:28----------
property no I don't I live in New York

---------03:30----------
City no I don't okay so let's take a

---------03:34----------
look at what it is that was broken here

---------03:35----------
right so what it is that has blown up

---------03:38----------
appears to be this chip you 70-90 is a

---------03:42----------
chip that is be used to power PP 3 V 4

---------03:45----------
to underscore G 3 ha P V 3 V 4 to

---------03:47----------
underscore G 3 hot is the power rail

---------03:49----------
that is going to power the system

---------03:51----------
management controller in addition to

---------03:53----------
powering the system management

---------03:54----------
controller it's also going to power the

---------03:56----------
SMC so if I click on P P 3 V 4 to

---------03:58----------
underscore G 3 hot on the board you'll

---------04:00----------
see that it goes to the system

---------04:02----------
management controller and it also goes

---------04:04----------
to something called the one wire circuit

---------04:07----------
down here now what is the one wire

---------04:08----------
circuit well that's an excellent

---------04:09----------
question

---------04:10----------
the one wire circuit is a circuit that's

---------04:12----------
going to allow the charge to speak to

---------04:13----------
the system management control so this is

---------04:15----------
a Mac remember it's not like a normal

---------04:17----------
computer you just plug it in

---------04:19----------
his power this is complicated it always

---------04:21----------
has to be complicated like a German car

---------04:23----------
let's just over engineer it so it fails

---------04:25----------
in two to four years so let's take a

---------04:28----------
look over here so we have this

---------04:32----------
ridiculous setup of so adapter sense oh

---------04:36----------
yes the the adapter is not going to turn

---------04:38----------
on what it worked probably the computers

---------04:39----------
not going to work properly unless it

---------04:41----------
gets to have a conversation with the

---------04:42----------
charger it's not like you can just you

---------04:44----------
know immediately just plug in and blow

---------04:46----------
your load you need to take you need to

---------04:48----------
take her to dinner you take her to a

---------04:50----------
movie you need to talk about your dreams

---------04:52----------
in life you need to talk about your

---------04:53----------
goals back and forth conversation and

---------04:56----------
then you can plug your 18 volts into her

---------04:58----------
so over here that's gonna happen on the

---------05:01----------
adapter sense line so adapter sense is

---------05:03----------
gonna come from the charger now adapter

---------05:06----------
sense needs to speak to the system

---------05:08----------
management controller on this one wire

---------05:10----------
line right over here however there's a

---------05:13----------
chance that you're going to send 18

---------05:16----------
volts instead of 3 volt data line to

---------05:18----------
that sense line why because this is a

---------05:21----------
magnetic charger everything's next to

---------05:22----------
one another so you have adapter sense

---------05:24----------
which is a 3 volt data line but then you

---------05:25----------
have this 18 or 20 volt power line up

---------05:28----------
here and as you can see this charger has

---------05:30----------
all of them right next to one another so

---------05:33----------
since they're all right next to one

---------05:34----------
another it's very easy if someone's

---------05:37----------
drunk and going plug my macula begin

---------05:43----------
because the liquor store is essential

---------05:45----------
and staying open and getting everybody

---------05:48----------
wasted there just like that you're gonna

---------05:54----------
plug your 18 volts into your 3 volt line

---------05:56----------
so the way that you prevent that from

---------05:57----------
happening over here is you have this

---------06:01----------
chip that sits between the adapter and

---------06:04----------
the system management controller so if

---------06:07----------
it sees a two point nine volt data line

---------06:09----------
this chip says sure go ahead talk to the

---------06:11----------
system management controller have a good

---------06:13----------
day but if it sees 18 volt it says ah

---------06:15----------
[ __ ] you you're not getting through this

---------06:18----------
chip that does that job is powered by

---------06:20----------
this one this one is powered by pp 3

---------06:21----------
before 2 and PP 3 or 4 2 is not working

---------06:24----------
because it looks like this like this and

---------06:28----------
it looks like that because it's a

---------06:29----------
[ __ ] Apple product why would you

---------06:31----------
expect it to work without blow

---------06:33----------
you bought the wrong thing and so if we

---------06:35----------
take a look at the machine when we plug

---------06:38----------
it in you'll see that we don't get a

---------06:40----------
light in the charger and the reason we

---------06:42----------
don't get a light in the charger is

---------06:43----------
because that PP 3 4 to underscore g3 hot

---------06:45----------
is missing and the reason it's missing

---------06:48----------
is oh no blame Tim Cook so what we're

---------06:52----------
gonna do here is take all that stuff off

---------06:54----------
the board replace it with stuff that's

---------06:56----------
not burned reassemble this and then

---------06:59----------
collect some essential customer money

---------07:03----------
which I will feel 110% no guilty

---------07:09----------
conscious in doing so since for the last

---------07:11----------
seven years I've been telling you to buy

---------07:12----------
it think that no I'm not gonna buy

---------07:16----------
ThinkPad I want to keep giving Louis

---------07:17----------
money all right I'll take your money you

---------07:20----------
want to keep giving a canal keep takin

---------07:22----------
I'll keep taking more and more essential

---------07:28----------
you just keep becoming more and more

---------07:30----------
essential more max you buy the more

---------07:35----------
essential I become the more max you buy

---------07:39----------
the more essential I become

---------07:52----------
well Your Honor we need to postpone this

---------07:54----------
trial in - my client learns sign

---------07:56----------
language is he not here

---------08:09----------
why are you wearing a mask I am wearing

---------08:11----------
a mask because at any moment my

---------08:13----------
employees can walk in and with my luck I

---------08:15----------
will sneeze a cough on them as soon as

---------08:16----------
they walk in and with my luck I will

---------08:19----------
have also gotten coronavirus on my way

---------08:21----------
to the store and wearing this

---------08:24----------
piece-of-shit mask is a fairly simple

---------08:27----------
way to slightly lower the chances that

---------08:30----------
people get sick which is worth it today

---------08:37----------
speaking of giving Willis Monty has some

---------08:39----------
people for to copass stop that keep your

---------08:41----------
money

---------08:53----------
how much flux will you use today

---------08:57----------
an essential amount this is an essential

---------09:00----------
amount of flux right here Louis the

---------09:03----------
population of New York City loves you

---------09:05----------
maybe that's why I haven't gotten looted

---------09:06----------
yet and if you go between 26th and 27th

---------09:10----------
Street on on 6th Avenue it looks like a

---------09:13----------
war zone

---------09:19----------
a lot of these businesses that don't

---------09:21----------
have gates I really don't understand it

---------09:24----------
it's very arrogant I care so much about

---------09:27----------
my appearance that I'm willing to

---------09:28----------
completely give up any semblance of

---------09:31----------
security in order to look slightly nicer

---------09:34----------
oh good luck with that strategy when

---------09:40----------
[ __ ] hits the fan I wouldn't want them

---------09:41----------
to be responsible for that place

---------10:04----------
I manage we visit the man hence I can

---------10:06----------
stalk these protests this is copass

---------10:07----------
they're not protesters as rioters be

---------10:10----------
clear

---------10:11----------
protesters are people that peacefully

---------10:14----------
assemble advocate for a particular cause

---------10:16----------
and seek to change the world to make it

---------10:18----------
a better place which is a good thing to

---------10:20----------
do

---------10:21----------
rioters are [ __ ]

---------10:30----------
it's important to not conflate the two

---------10:37----------
like if people just decided to toss pipe

---------10:39----------
bombs into Apple stores and they wrote

---------10:42----------
right to repairing the pipe bomb I would

---------10:44----------
not call that a right to repair advocate

---------10:46----------
you know I wouldn't want my causes to be

---------10:49----------
slandered in such a way I wouldn't want

---------10:51----------
my business to be slandered in such a

---------10:52----------
way or to get marked in with other

---------10:55----------
people who were doing things that are

---------10:57----------
disgusting so I'm not gonna do that to

---------11:00----------
the people who are protesting for these

---------11:03----------
reasons in these causes

---------11:13----------
you need to be able to separate the

---------11:16----------
people who are actually looking to try

---------11:19----------
and make the world better with people

---------11:21----------
who are making the world worse under the

---------11:23----------
guise that we want to make the world

---------11:24----------
better there's a lot of people out there

---------11:27----------
there's a lot of well-meaning good

---------11:29----------
people out there that want to see the

---------11:30----------
world become better and they're working

---------11:31----------
and marching and trying to do it trying

---------11:33----------
to get there

---------11:41----------
the point one percent that decided to

---------11:43----------
destroy that little restaurant on the

---------11:46----------
corner that was already out of business

---------11:47----------
and already bankrupt it's like hey [ __ ]

---------11:50----------
you

---------11:50----------
[Applause]

---------12:00----------
I think I just killed him

---------12:06----------
I just murdered him

---------12:11----------
he's dead now

---------12:18----------
he's dead

---------12:36----------
my best friend she says the Union armed

---------12:38----------
security I think that may be a waste if

---------12:43----------
people actually manage to get past my

---------12:46----------
gate and everything else then that means

---------12:49----------
they probably have a forklift or a tank

---------12:52----------
or 500 people in which case the armed

---------12:55----------
security is useless and if they don't

---------12:57----------
get past it then they didn't get past

---------12:58----------
because I have thought about I have

---------13:00----------
thought about hiring a security company

---------13:01----------
but every single time I've seen that a

---------13:04----------
store or an office or a business hires

---------13:06----------
private security you know unless you're

---------13:08----------
a multi-millionaire you're getting the

---------13:10----------
you're getting the cops that couldn't

---------13:13----------
really pass the the tests anymore that

---------13:15----------
decided to retire early that you know

---------13:18----------
couldn't jump over three bricks on top

---------13:21----------
of each other it's like that's not gonna

---------13:22----------
do anything here that's not I think I'm

---------13:25----------
pretty set unless someone gets a

---------13:27----------
forklift because I saw that one with

---------13:29----------
this one video where there was someone

---------13:30----------
using a forklift to get in and like

---------13:32----------
that's not gonna hey I don't think

---------13:36----------
that's gonna happen here I don't think

---------13:37----------
we're at that point yet

---------13:43----------
when I saw a forklift being used to

---------13:46----------
break into stores the only thing I could

---------13:47----------
think at that point is a really which

---------13:48----------
Apple were the ones making the forklifts

---------13:51----------
then I could count on it not working

---------14:24----------
stop giving ideas so sorry tor

---------14:31----------
I'd be kind of curious to see what Apple

---------14:33----------
does is what makes us a forklift

---------15:16----------
these logitech track balls that I have

---------15:18----------
really only last a few months before

---------15:20----------
they stopped working and it's starting

---------15:21----------
to annoy me

---------15:46----------
you do the rotten apple one over the

---------15:49----------
shop in Norway yes I did and I don't

---------15:51----------
care I don't care for two reasons

---------15:54----------
watch my video titled why I was wrong

---------15:57----------
about the henrik who's be case then

---------15:59----------
watch my video why how journalists lose

---------16:02----------
the trust of their readers and you

---------16:03----------
should gain some good insight as to why

---------16:05----------
I do not care about the that case right

---------16:08----------
now

---------17:21----------
I'm feeling pretty essential right now

---------17:28----------
stand-up data but that I doubt that

---------17:37----------
[Music]

---------18:57----------
[Applause]

---------19:03----------
cheers from covert countries as Claudio

---------19:06----------
that's kind of [ __ ] up yeah

---------19:18----------
hello from Chile keep up the good work

---------19:19----------
for 1,000 claps

---------19:26----------
well let's see what happens here does

---------19:28----------
this thing turn on does this turn on do

---------19:31----------
we have pp3 before to underscore g3 hot

---------19:38----------
no we don't okay okay what the [ __ ]

---------19:46----------
happened

---------19:52----------
supergirl input

---------19:59----------
18 volts in 18 volts into the pp 3 V 4

---------20:04----------
to 18 volts of the diode point 2 volts

---------20:09----------
at output all right is the output

---------20:13----------
shorted is output shorted is output

---------20:16----------
shorted if it's not shorted those forget

---------20:20----------
to put a resistor there because he's a

---------20:21----------
[ __ ] let's see that Lewis forget to put

---------20:25----------
a resistor there because he's a [ __ ]

---------20:27----------
maybe probably I did I probably did so

---------20:33----------
remember this needs to be enabled and

---------20:35----------
the enable is gonna be when you get more

---------20:37----------
than 2 volts at this pin should'

---------20:39----------
shouldnt does not stand for I shouldn't

---------20:43----------
have opened a store location that was

---------20:46----------
larger in New York City at the same time

---------20:48----------
that a pandemic was struck in striking

---------20:50----------
along with riots it stands for shutdown

---------20:52----------
as in less than 2 volt there and it will

---------20:54----------
shut down so there is a resistor that I

---------20:58----------
forgot to put there because I'm a

---------20:59----------
dumbass I'm a dumbass and I forgot to

---------21:01----------
put that resistor over that resistor

---------21:04----------
needs to be there in order for it to

---------21:05----------
turn on and of course I didn't put the

---------21:08----------
resistor there I guess that's a good

---------21:12----------
argument for no right to repair you

---------21:16----------
don't want people like Lewis who forgot

---------21:18----------
to put this [ __ ] in resistor they're

---------21:20----------
working on your product now do you do

---------21:24----------
you do you know you don't know you don't

---------21:33----------
you don't want those filthy independent

---------21:38----------
repair people [ __ ] up your dings

---------21:56----------
oh yeah for stream lab as they do but I

---------21:59----------
would have to I have to stream labs

---------22:01----------
accounts one for the main channel one

---------22:02----------
for the other want live so I have to

---------22:05----------
check sign-in and sign-out it's a pain

---------22:07----------
in the dick um I want to fix my board I

---------22:12----------
fixed my board all right soldered got to

---------22:19----------
make sure the people from England are

---------22:20----------
happy that I use my pronouncement there

---------22:22----------
else solder it on there plugging in the

---------22:29----------
right in and there's an orange light an

---------22:32----------
amp is being taken and the fan is

---------22:34----------
spinning yeah that's it for today and as

---------22:45----------
always remember if you want to make sure

---------22:47----------
that businesses like mine are not

---------22:49----------
essential are you one of those many

---------22:51----------
thousands of people that message me

---------22:53----------
emailed me or said something really

---------22:54----------
nasty on a forum about the fact that I

---------22:55----------
stayed open throughout this whole thing

---------22:57----------
one of the best things that you could do

---------22:59----------
to ensure that my business is not

---------23:01----------
essential is stop buying this crap by a

---------23:05----------
think pet buying a thing pet is the

---------23:07----------
quickest way to ensure that I am no

---------23:09----------
longer essential that's it for today and

---------23:13----------
as always I hope you learned something

---------23:15----------
I'll see you all in the next video bye

---------23:18----------
now
