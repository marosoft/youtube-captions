---------00:00----------
random random MacBook all right we're

---------00:08----------
gonna take a look over this board and

---------00:09----------
see if we can figure out what's wrong

---------00:10----------
with it

---------00:18----------
hmm I wonder what this is over here

---------00:20----------
random random

---------00:49----------
don't trust him Hey look we do fight

---------01:07----------
looks like we own two capacitors with a

---------01:09----------
little bit of green buy them perhaps

---------01:15----------
this can be fixed by just blowing them

---------01:19----------
off the board

---------01:24----------
yes very difficult

---------01:51----------
all right so now that we've removed

---------01:53----------
those three caps they were along the PP

---------01:57----------
three before to underscore g3 hotline

---------01:59----------
we're gonna see if we still have a short

---------02:01----------
circuit to ground on PP three before -

---------02:04----------
lets get the meter on the screen going

---------02:07----------
to impedance mode and what do you know

---------02:11----------
the short circuit is gone green light

---------02:16----------
fan spin

---------02:17----------
so all this board had was a short to

---------02:20----------
ground on PP 3 V 4 to underscore g3 huh

---------02:23----------
and all it had we're just a couple

---------02:25----------
little caps right here that was it

---------02:28----------
this is all there was to it it's funny

---------02:31----------
change where you're sitting and now all

---------02:33----------
the boards that are coming in are so

---------02:34----------
much easier random random

---------02:54----------
[Music]

---------03:01----------
what's wrong with that one what's wrong

---------03:04----------
with that one yeah 2011-12 no it's a

---------03:11----------
turn-on no brainer just did the caps

---------03:14----------
don't really need to be there they're

---------03:15----------
not super important think of these caps

---------03:17----------
like no Sara's makeup like she thinks

---------03:21----------
she looks better with makeup but in

---------03:23----------
reality she might even look better

---------03:25----------
without it and it's not really necessary

---------03:27----------
but it kind of makes you feel better to

---------03:28----------
have it there so we're just gonna put

---------03:33----------
those caps back on there so the board

---------03:35----------
feels better about itself we won our

---------03:37----------
82000 165 Steph confidence

---------04:08----------
he was being used as a noun Mikey turned

---------04:14----------
you into a noun

---------04:18----------
check it out

---------04:19----------
green light fan spin no more short so

---------04:23----------
that was that all he had as a short two

---------04:25----------
grounds on PP 34 - and now this board

---------04:27----------
setting her to go so that's it for today

---------04:28----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------04:30----------
something when random

---------04:45----------
