---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're gonna get started working on an 8

---------00:02----------
1502 MacBook Pro that has no power let's

---------00:06----------
see if we can fix this MacBook and get

---------00:07----------
rid of its coronavirus lots of MacBooks

---------00:11----------
with coronavirus nowadays and we are

---------00:13----------
here to fix them and make them work

---------00:15----------
again I can't cure the real coronavirus

---------00:20----------
but I can cure the macbook virus so

---------00:22----------
let's see what's going on with this

---------00:24----------
MacBook here we're gonna plug this in

---------00:28----------
and see if it turns on alright so as you

---------00:30----------
can see we're taking 130 ml amps and we

---------00:33----------
have no light in the charger now this is

---------00:34----------
something I've never seen before I've

---------00:35----------
never seen 136 ml amps out of any a 1502

---------00:39----------
or even a 1398 machine so we're gonna do

---------00:42----------
here is we're gonna unplug everything

---------00:44----------
from the machine and see if there's

---------00:45----------
anything causing this particular problem

---------00:47----------
one thing I'm curious about is is pp 3 4

---------00:49----------
to underscore g3 hah present because as

---------00:51----------
you know we need PP 3 v 4 to underscore

---------00:54----------
g3 huh to be present in order for us to

---------00:56----------
get a light on the charger and we don't

---------00:59----------
have a light in the charger at the

---------01:00----------
moment now that could also be because

---------01:02----------
something that was plugged in was

---------01:03----------
stopping it like the keyboard of the

---------01:05----------
trackpad very often the case but as you

---------01:07----------
can see that's not it here since I

---------01:08----------
unplugged the keyboard in the trackpad

---------01:09----------
still no green light and still taking

---------01:12----------
130 milliamp

---------01:16----------
the way you've been sniffing over the

---------01:18----------
past couple of days I'm pretty sure

---------01:19----------
you've been in fact the two weeks ago

---------01:20----------
now I've had the sniffles ever since I

---------01:22----------
got back from from Maine in in January

---------01:26----------
actually around that at that time I had

---------01:28----------
it I've had allergies for a while so

---------01:31----------
that's not virus let's take a look on

---------01:32----------
the board and see if anything looks

---------01:33----------
funny [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] what the

---------01:38----------
[ __ ] is that what the [ __ ] is that

---------01:43----------
that's supposed to be an ISL 1659 and

---------01:47----------
it's a [ __ ] solder blob like what the

---------01:51----------
hell is this this isn't what the Shh

---------01:58----------
okay okay this is stupid this is stupid

---------02:03----------
who did this so the chip has a hole in

---------02:05----------
it but in addition to the chip having a

---------02:08----------
hole in it it's oh come on come on this

---------02:11----------
is dumb

---------02:12----------
this is dumb this is really dumb what

---------02:14----------
the [ __ ] okay so some somebody saw a

---------02:16----------
chip had a hole in it open the board and

---------02:18----------
decided to pour a layer of solder on top

---------02:21----------
of the chip that had a hole in it Wow I

---------02:24----------
wouldn't even expect a genius to do that

---------02:27----------
all right

---------02:28----------
so I'm going to replace this chip with

---------02:32----------
another one and see if this board works

---------02:34----------
again and get this back to some happy

---------02:36----------
person who cat least now we'll have

---------02:38----------
something to do during the quarantine I

---------02:40----------
think that my business is somewhat

---------02:42----------
essential if you're gonna ask people to

---------02:44----------
sit indoors all day Andrew and their

---------02:47----------
only method of communication

---------02:48----------
entertainment or information gathering

---------02:50----------
is this piece of [ __ ] machine they need

---------02:52----------
this thing to work and if Apple's gonna

---------02:54----------
be off if Apple's not gonna be at work

---------02:57----------
because of coronavirus that's fine I

---------02:59----------
will come to work I don't care if it is

---------03:02----------
10:44 at night and there is nobody at

---------03:05----------
the store besides me I will sit here by

---------03:07----------
myself so that nobody gets infected and

---------03:09----------
just fix MacBook because that's what

---------03:12----------
I've been doing for the past eight years

---------03:13----------
in high

---------03:14----------
I sit at the store really late at night

---------03:17----------
until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning

---------03:18----------
I ride my bicycle home on routes where

---------03:22----------
there's no people because sane people

---------03:24----------
are not riding their bicycle on the

---------03:27----------
street home at 3:00 in the morning

---------03:30----------
I've always been quarantined I insomnia

---------03:34----------
quarantine myself that's a type of

---------03:37----------
quarantine sit here me and my $800 air

---------03:45----------
air filter and I will after this is done

---------03:52----------
we're gonna alcohol off this entire

---------03:53----------
MacBook send it back to a customer and

---------03:56----------
hopefully they'll have something to do

---------03:59----------
somebody's got to do it

---------04:06----------
alright so there's a trace on the board

---------04:08----------
that got burned up I'm trying to push it

---------04:10----------
back down yeah okay I just pushed it

---------04:13----------
back down beautiful

---------04:33----------
Corona Corona Corona

---------04:54----------
Corona Corona

---------05:07----------
what do you think this Corona will do to

---------05:09----------
your shop I think we will figure out how

---------05:14----------
well we get along in times of strife how

---------05:18----------
does my business work in times of strife

---------05:20----------
what kind of you know have I treated the

---------05:24----------
people that work here well or not we're

---------05:26----------
gonna figure out cuz that's the thing

---------05:27----------
you figure out in times of great strife

---------05:29----------
if you've done the right things or not

---------05:30----------
you know there's times like this there's

---------05:33----------
a lot more than just don't get me wrong

---------05:35----------
money counts a lot my money does a lot

---------05:38----------
you know people will but at the same

---------05:42----------
time I think we'll figure out if I've if

---------05:44----------
I've created a good company or not if I

---------05:47----------
do get through this and I survive maybe

---------05:49----------
I created a decent company if everything

---------05:52----------
falls apart

---------05:53----------
then you know maybe my company shittier

---------05:56----------
than I think no way to really tell until

---------05:58----------
it's done you know wow I hate these

---------06:00----------
alcohol dispensers for anybody who

---------06:04----------
doesn't believe this by the way this is

---------06:06----------
[ __ ] alcohol dispenser right look see

---------06:08----------
us I'm trying to wet my q-tip one two

---------06:11----------
three four five there you go no now it

---------06:13----------
shoots out because I'm putting I put it

---------06:14----------
on camera that's the way that works it

---------06:16----------
only works when it's on camera

---------06:29----------
I don't know cheater

---------06:31----------
that's not really that's not a real

---------06:33----------
question that's not a real question

---------06:37----------
that's the problem as business knows we

---------06:40----------
dropped off yeah melons are still coming

---------06:43----------
in a lot less walking

---------06:51----------
the real problem here is with the lack

---------06:53----------
of ability to just pause because if we

---------06:55----------
were able to pause then it wouldn't be

---------06:57----------
that bad you know any sort of real

---------06:58----------
shutdown the problem is that the way

---------07:01----------
it's gonna work is I'm not gonna have

---------07:03----------
business for a while but I'm gonna have

---------07:06----------
to pay the staff and my landlord is

---------07:08----------
gonna want his money and I'm probably

---------07:11----------
gonna wind up getting nothing from from

---------07:14----------
government or anything like that so

---------07:15----------
that's that's where the real problem

---------07:16----------
comes from here is that oh there's a

---------07:19----------
it's a partial pause right because if it

---------07:21----------
was a full-on pause it wouldn't be too

---------07:23----------
awful but if it's a pause on customers

---------07:26----------
coming in a pause on the store being

---------07:28----------
open but no pause on on rent payroll

---------07:32----------
insurance you know alarm system bill all

---------07:35----------
this other [ __ ] and that that's where

---------07:37----------
the problem comes in because you know

---------07:40----------
it's not like people are are showing up

---------07:42----------
to work and doing all the things that

---------07:44----------
they're doing because they really want

---------07:46----------
to see other people get sick or because

---------07:47----------
they just love their job that much maybe

---------07:50----------
some crazy lunatics love their job that

---------07:53----------
much people that like seeing the green

---------07:56----------
light again some people will do anything

---------07:57----------
to see the green light again but it's

---------08:00----------
that it's it's not a real pause and

---------08:02----------
there's also a lack of trust in

---------08:04----------
government when it comes when they think

---------08:06----------
Cuomo or if it's a Blasio said something

---------08:08----------
like you know stay home now you'll worry

---------08:10----------
about the economy later it's easy for

---------08:12----------
you to say [ __ ] face something tells me

---------08:17----------
you have bigger coffers to pay your

---------08:19----------
twelve thousand five hundred dollars a

---------08:20----------
month in rent firm than I do you know

---------08:23----------
like it's easy for you to say worry

---------08:26----------
about the economics of it later you

---------08:28----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] face the only reason you're

---------08:31----------
even governor is because your dad was

---------08:32----------
governor you're a governor because your

---------08:35----------
dad was governor that's an easy job

---------08:41----------
why are you governor because my dad had

---------08:43----------
a bridge named after him [ __ ] out of

---------08:46----------
here parent so where was I hear what I

---------08:50----------
was did Apple releases it as Creed GPU

---------08:51----------
that's not gonna happen that's not gonna

---------08:54----------
happen they can't do that they're not

---------08:56----------
allowed I'm pretty sure there's a

---------08:58----------
regulation saying that Apple is not

---------08:59----------
allowed to release a discrete GPU it

---------09:01----------
would die in five days bear with me in

---------09:04----------
mind the hypothetical Mad Max world

---------09:06----------
would you grab your people a secure

---------09:07----------
resource in Hollywood you go out and try

---------09:09----------
to organize into civilization I can't

---------09:11----------
answer hypotheticals that are very dick

---------09:13----------
ulis because there's too many too much

---------09:18----------
is not accounted for there

---------09:21----------
that's like saying you've met a girl who

---------09:25----------
said she watched your videos what do you

---------09:28----------
do am i single or am i not single is she

---------09:31----------
interesting or is she boring is she

---------09:32----------
crazy or is she normal like is she cute

---------09:36----------
or is she not his she's this there's so

---------09:43----------
many things that are not read that you

---------09:44----------
need to know in order to answer a

---------09:45----------
question like that and that's just it's

---------09:48----------
a boring hypothetical I'm pretty sure I

---------09:52----------
was on the board like this and if it

---------09:53----------
wasn't then L will tell me

---------10:12----------
[Music]

---------10:16----------
uh yeah Tech loose I just use I'm using

---------10:18----------
a different one I'm using it I add

---------10:20----------
another transmitter so I have two

---------10:22----------
transmitters here just in case I wanted

---------10:23----------
to do interviews and stuff like that so

---------10:25----------
I have a spare for when one of them

---------10:27----------
[ __ ] up so I still have the other

---------10:30----------
broken one there I just don't use it

---------10:32----------
right now I don't feel like buying a new

---------10:35----------
one in three months if I still have a

---------10:40----------
business I will replace my wireless

---------10:43----------
transmitter I like this one not the

---------10:47----------
Sennheiser one when it works is nice to

---------10:50----------
be clear that's a big if I mean when

---------10:51----------
when it works it's nice when someone in

---------10:55----------
chat tell me why the Luas heats a bore

---------10:56----------
with hot air the same reason that you

---------10:59----------
cook a steak instead of eating just

---------11:01----------
eating the cow in front of you

---------11:08----------
same reason that you put gas in a car I

---------11:13----------
heat the board with hot air so that the

---------11:16----------
solder will melt and the chips will go

---------11:18----------
on and off what I need them to yeah like

---------11:26----------
that's a good one with bars so for

---------11:27----------
example so the city said you know shut

---------11:30----------
down your bar right okay cool fine I'm

---------11:32----------
forced to shut down my bar do I still

---------11:35----------
have to pay rent

---------11:36----------
because I think that's what's killing

---------11:37----------
bar owners you know if the bar was shut

---------11:39----------
down but they didn't have to pay rent in

---------11:41----------
the bar and then the company that owns

---------11:44----------
the building the bar was in didn't have

---------11:47----------
to pay property taxes to the state for

---------11:49----------
that month and they didn't have to pay

---------11:51----------
the mortgage on the bar for that month

---------11:53----------
fit on the bill in the bars in for that

---------11:54----------
month then pausing would be it would

---------11:56----------
work but pausing doesn't work if you say

---------11:58----------
bar you can't open but you got to pay

---------12:01----------
your insurance and your rands and more

---------12:03----------
get in bubble that doesn't work it's a

---------12:04----------
it's a half-measure okay and the problem

---------12:09----------
is you can't get everybody to

---------12:10----------
collectively pause at the same time

---------12:12----------
because everybody has different

---------12:13----------
incentives everybody there are too many

---------12:15----------
different industries that are

---------12:16----------
intertwined with one another so I'm very

---------12:19----------
curious how that's gonna be made to work

---------12:20----------
now as you can see after replacing our

---------12:23----------
ISO 65 9 chip which is responsible for

---------12:25----------
pbht 3 hot I get a green light than an

---------12:27----------
orange light and then a fan spin which

---------12:30----------
means this MacBook now works again this

---------12:35----------
MacBook now works again beautiful look

---------12:40----------
at that look at that the fan spinning

---------12:44----------
and that beautiful it works so what

---------12:49----------
happened here is the chip responsible

---------12:50----------
for creating pbht three heart well point

---------12:52----------
three to six more power rail called the

---------12:53----------
ISL 65:9 known in the schematic is used

---------12:55----------
7,000 u 7100 in schematics made after

---------12:58----------
2012 wound up have it dying it at a hole

---------13:00----------
in it and for some reason some crazy

---------13:02----------
sick lunatic probably [ __ ] JS $0.02

---------13:05----------
decided that instead of actually

---------13:06----------
replacing the chip I'm just gonna put a

---------13:08----------
bunch of solder on top of it this is why

---------13:11----------
you don't send your board to J's to

---------13:13----------
sense for him to fix it because that's

---------13:15----------
what he's gonna do to it and then it

---------13:18----------
didn't work

---------13:19----------
but we fix it by just finding the chip

---------13:22----------
in like bing-bang-boom and bamm bing

---------13:24----------
bang boom BAM that's pretty much it so

---------13:26----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------13:28----------
you learned something don't send your

---------13:29----------
board to J's two cents

---------13:39----------
you
