---------00:00----------
hi so today I wanted to address

---------00:01----------
something that's been showing up my

---------00:02----------
comment stream a lot lately and I want

---------00:04----------
to try to turn it around into something

---------00:06----------
positive so one of the things that you

---------00:08----------
may find with most people that do these

---------00:09----------
types of guides or educational videos

---------00:11----------
online is that they're often showing you

---------00:13----------
the best possible scenario of when

---------00:16----------
everything went right so those are ten

---------00:18----------
or twenty or thirty takes of something

---------00:19----------
and that's not something that I've ever

---------00:21----------
really believed in doing but there are

---------00:23----------
times where I don't even turn on the

---------00:25----------
camera because I just or I just don't

---------00:26----------
upload something because it's just I

---------00:28----------
know it probably won't make a good video

---------00:30----------
and something I've been noticing more

---------00:32----------
and more in the last few weeks I'm not

---------00:34----------
sure if it's something people are

---------00:36----------
noticing more or it's something that's

---------00:37----------
being that I'm doing more there's a lot

---------00:40----------
of the comments on the hand steadiness

---------00:42----------
of my hand shaking I get this like oh

---------00:45----------
are you on cocaine early onset

---------00:46----------
Parkinson's lol kind of stuff and I got

---------00:50----------
a you know I got a lot of it also for

---------00:51----------
that Michael Carvin interview because

---------00:53----------
people said you know oh it's not just

---------00:55----------
that you or you don't like sitting still

---------00:56----------
for an hour when reality I really just

---------00:59----------
don't like sitting still for an hour but

---------01:01----------
a lot of people were saying things like

---------01:02----------
you know all that like just some of it y

---------01:04----------
know is probably genuine concern some of

---------01:06----------
it is just silly trolling and rather

---------01:09----------
than take that the wrong way this may

---------01:11----------
surprise you but there are things I

---------01:12----------
don't feel like sharing with the

---------01:13----------
Internet but rather than take it the

---------01:15----------
wrong way I wanted to use it to address

---------01:17----------
another set of comments in my stream

---------01:18----------
which is that I probably can't do this

---------01:21----------
or I wish I had steady hands to do this

---------01:23----------
that or the other I don't have steady

---------01:24----------
hands so that's why I can't place the

---------01:26----------
component so rather than take it as a

---------01:27----------
negative I want to try to turn this

---------01:29----------
around and turn it into something

---------01:30----------
positive and encouraging which is that

---------01:33----------
yes I don't have steady hands no I don't

---------01:35----------
feel like publishing why that is on the

---------01:37----------
internet and but what I do want to do is

---------01:39----------
show you that yes you can do this stuff

---------01:41----------
even if you are a bit shaky or you're

---------01:44----------
not really good at making precise hand

---------01:47----------
movements or leg movements or whatever

---------01:48----------
anything like that so today is usually

---------01:50----------
one of the days where I wouldn't want to

---------01:51----------
film anything because I'm not feeling

---------01:53----------
particularly great in that area but I

---------01:55----------
thought it would actually be helpful if

---------01:56----------
I did film something today even though I

---------01:58----------
don't feel great in that regard because

---------02:00----------
you might actually become encouraged by

---------02:02----------
it so if you're somebody who's having

---------02:03----------
issues with soldering because your hands

---------02:06----------
don't stay very steady and you can't

---------02:08----------
place things properly I figured I would

---------02:10----------
show you me doing of what's supposed to

---------02:13----------
be of

---------02:13----------
very very simple job if you have steady

---------02:15----------
hands and something that a lot of people

---------02:17----------
think requires steady hands I just

---------02:19----------
figured I would show it to you on today

---------02:20----------
so we're gonna start with this LCD

---------02:23----------
connector over here okay so this is what

---------02:25----------
the board looks like over here and I

---------02:27----------
might as well get my regular camera in

---------02:28----------
view so that you can see the entire

---------02:30----------
thing since this is supposed to be

---------02:32----------
educational and encouraging experience

---------02:35----------
I'm gonna kick on the air filter there

---------02:37----------
is a little bit of solder that has to

---------02:39----------
get wikked on the side over here you can

---------02:42----------
see that this is also broken so this is

---------02:44----------
gonna require a wire get run to it see

---------02:47----------
this the trace between here where

---------02:49----------
backlight is and over here doesn't look

---------02:52----------
very good little wicking on and we grab

---------03:05----------
a connector

---------03:21----------
yeah now first thing that I like to do

---------03:24----------
here is add a lot of flux I think that's

---------03:28----------
the first time I actually said a lot

---------03:29----------
instead of a little because I feel I can

---------03:30----------
make the mistake in so many of these

---------03:39----------
I can't work with this guy okay

---------03:48----------
the first thing I'm going to do here is

---------03:50----------
I guess lower the exposure since you can

---------03:52----------
barely see there

---------04:00----------
the first thing I'm going to do is

---------04:02----------
solder one of these little anchors on

---------04:03----------
but that's not good enough as you can

---------04:05----------
see that's clearly not aligned all I did

---------04:08----------
is I just did it there so that I'd have

---------04:10----------
solder on the pad so that I can then do

---------04:11----------
this and move it around a little I don't

---------04:13----------
want to move it around too much because

---------04:14----------
if I move it around too much and I'll be

---------04:17----------
out of place that's exactly what I want

---------04:19----------
it to be and I have a little solder on

---------04:22----------
the top but I'll live with that it's not

---------04:24----------
gonna hurt anybody now we go over to the

---------04:26----------
other side and we're going to do the

---------04:28----------
same thing and the important thing here

---------04:29----------
is to have flux that's already there

---------04:32----------
because I'm burning the flux away on the

---------04:35----------
tip of the iron right now and you just

---------04:40----------
tap this down the most important thing

---------04:42----------
is that it be flat on the board although

---------04:44----------
the thing that the issue that I noticed

---------04:45----------
a lot of people have is that they're not

---------04:46----------
flat on the board as they work and then

---------04:49----------
it makes the entire process a complete

---------04:52----------
friggin nightmare so now that we're done

---------04:56----------
with those pins we're going to do these

---------04:58----------
ones over here

---------05:13----------
okay now we get this one over here don't

---------05:16----------
add too much cider you don't want it

---------05:18----------
going inside the connector it's easier

---------05:20----------
to get it inside the connector than you

---------05:22----------
think all right so now we're gonna go

---------05:24----------
over the regular legs of the chip

---------05:26----------
another chip of the bit to connect okay

---------05:36----------
so now we go over each individual pad in

---------05:40----------
each individual pin and you may think

---------05:44----------
your hands are not steady it's

---------05:45----------
impossible to do this yeah yeah my

---------05:49----------
sympathy for you is so high right now

---------05:52----------
now see what I'm gonna do here is I'm

---------05:54----------
gonna turn the ire and I'm not gonna use

---------05:56----------
this because I see a lot of people do

---------05:58----------
with something like this whoops whoops

---------06:01----------
whoops oh my hands not steady that's why

---------06:04----------
I can't do it and they make a big

---------06:05----------
 of everything it's technique

---------06:06----------
baby technique so see this see how the

---------06:09----------
iron over here that I'm using that you

---------06:11----------
can barely probably even see

---------06:12----------
right now as a tip that's the tip but

---------06:14----------
that's not what I'm interested in using

---------06:16----------
I'm interested in using the elbow see

---------06:18----------
the elbow which is kind of closer to

---------06:19----------
like here the elbow is going at touch

---------06:23----------
both the pin and the pad and it's gonna

---------06:26----------
let me do something like this ready

---------06:27----------
ready ready

---------06:29----------
look at that look at that

---------06:32----------
Factory BAM see that there's no way in

---------06:36----------
hell I'm doing this pin by pin they do

---------06:40----------
this this now that blob I'm gonna drag

---------06:44----------
the blob out to the two pins that are

---------06:46----------
supposed to be shorted together to begin

---------06:47----------
with and I'm going to run a wire so

---------06:53----------
we're gonna do this

---------07:28----------
the scrape off the insulation on the

---------07:31----------
wire

---------07:38----------
yeah now they have the way huh see

---------07:43----------
they're calling the complete I know no

---------07:53----------
trust me I am already with you on the

---------07:54----------
same page I know the small piece of the

---------07:58----------
conversation you overheard sounded

---------08:00----------
really mean but there's a company that

---------08:02----------
we set something up for and we'd be set

---------08:05----------
up everything and we pretty much said

---------08:06----------
okay here's the accounts here's a

---------08:08----------
username as your password and you need

---------08:11----------
if you may you know if you want to make

---------08:12----------
changes to it you have to make them here

---------08:14----------
so for example let's say that you get

---------08:16----------
rid of your old credit card that you're

---------08:18----------
using for billing you now have to change

---------08:21----------
it in here not only did they never set

---------08:23----------
up their own account not only did they

---------08:25----------
change their card not only did they

---------08:27----------
never contact us when they changed all

---------08:30----------
of it so that we could help them with it

---------08:31----------
but then they actively sought out to

---------08:34----------
 and blame us for the entire thing

---------08:36----------
like it's my fault that it's totally my

---------08:38----------
fault that you didn't tell me that you

---------08:40----------
changed your credit card and billing

---------08:41----------
information I don't get it I don't get

---------08:47----------
it

---------08:49----------
and that's the thing like these people

---------08:51----------
are so nice there's so nice when

---------08:55----------
you when you point it out but before you

---------08:57----------
point it out they are like it's your

---------08:59----------
fault how dare you I can't believe this

---------09:02----------
you guys are bad blah blah and it's like

---------09:04----------
seriously man seriously ah anyone that's

---------09:13----------
the connector it's one of those things

---------09:16----------
like okay make a mistake forget to pay

---------09:18----------
your bill don't give me the information

---------09:20----------
so that I can help you if you don't know

---------09:22----------
how to use your account never contact me

---------09:24----------
change your car do all that that's all

---------09:26----------
that's fine I'm okay with that I will

---------09:29----------
more than happily sit down and help you

---------09:31----------
out without charging you a dime for a

---------09:33----------
place that I have no support contract

---------09:37----------
with this because we set up your system

---------09:38----------
I will help you out not charge you a

---------09:40----------
dime but for sake don't call them

---------09:43----------
with that attitude like I added

---------09:45----------
something because I've done that before

---------09:48----------
I've done some stupid I remember I

---------09:49----------
actually wound up getting the con Edison

---------09:53----------
turned off here once and I like I didn't

---------09:56----------
call up con Edison going mom up like no

---------09:59----------
I know I didn't pay my I forgot to pay

---------10:01----------
my bill you know like you know when you

---------10:04----------
did something really stupid anyway ah

---------10:06----------
that is one sexy-looking connector I

---------10:09----------
love kit I love this one because it

---------10:11----------
looks like a middle finger right there

---------10:12----------
see that that is my middle finger you

---------10:14----------
know we're gonna plug in a screen and

---------10:17----------
see if we get a light but man it's so

---------10:21----------
great

---------10:22----------
it's so great to be on the same page

---------10:23----------
because I didn't answer the phone the

---------10:24----------
other person answered the phone I knew

---------10:26----------
from hearing three letters three words

---------10:29----------
exactly what it was gonna be and I just

---------10:31----------
look at him and say balance low and he

---------10:35----------
knew exactly what to say there's no back

---------10:36----------
and forth or anything it's good you know

---------10:38----------
people that that's one thing about tech

---------10:39----------
people are gonna try to catch you off

---------10:41----------
guard at this type of stuff like

---------10:42----------
everything becomes your fault it's all

---------10:45----------
on you and then you get and then you get

---------10:50----------
humbled

---------10:59----------
so now I'm getting a call because they

---------11:01----------
they want you know why isn't it back on

---------11:03----------
yeah and it's like you know I know you

---------11:05----------
know when you you that you don't freak

---------11:07----------
pay your cable bill and you then you pay

---------11:08----------
your cable bill but you still got to

---------11:10----------
wait 45 minutes for your cable to turn

---------11:11----------
back on yep that's that type of thing

---------11:16----------
all right so let's see what again

---------11:32----------
I get a light I think I bridged pins

---------11:35----------
four and three though because I saw the

---------11:37----------
I saw the screen the Inc activate before

---------11:39----------
it should have let me just take a look

---------11:41----------
and make sure I didn't bridge pins those

---------11:43----------
pins let's see did I did I did I know I

---------11:51----------
didn't that's just that that's me being

---------11:53----------
a lunatic alright so yeah that's that it

---------11:57----------
worked and again as always you're not

---------11:59----------
that I want you to really get this with

---------12:01----------
this channel you're not always gonna be

---------12:03----------
perfect you're not always gonna get

---------12:04----------
everything a hundred percent right and

---------12:05----------
if you wait until you can get things a

---------12:07----------
hundred percent right you're never going

---------12:09----------
to get anything done and I'm not saying

---------12:12----------
that you should start working on

---------12:13----------
customer devices before you know what

---------12:15----------
you're doing I'm not saying that you

---------12:16----------
should work on things that belong other

---------12:18----------
people when you don't know how to use

---------12:19----------
any of the equipment that's not what I'm

---------12:20----------
saying all I'm saying is I'm trying to

---------12:23----------
give you an encouraging message I'm not

---------12:24----------
encouraging you to go nuts the first

---------12:27----------
time you use this without any knowledge

---------12:28----------
of how it works but I don't want you to

---------12:30----------
be discouraged from trying at all just

---------12:32----------
because you may not be as perfect as a

---------12:34----------
video you see on the internet you know

---------12:36----------
it just it's just all about practice and

---------12:39----------
with time you'll find ways of overcoming

---------12:41----------
your deficiency so for example I know

---------12:43----------
that I am very very good at tracing down

---------12:46----------
faults I'm good at learning how you know

---------12:48----------
what the sequence of something is and

---------12:50----------
tracing down faults I'm really good at

---------12:52----------
that but I know that I suck when it

---------12:53----------
comes to like you know like all those

---------12:56----------
little precise hand movements I am like

---------12:58----------
I had my earwax removed this morning and

---------13:00----------
just of the proficiency with which this

---------13:01----------
person was like I using a little stick

---------13:03----------
to go into my ear and pull out little

---------13:05----------
pieces without piercing my ear drum you

---------13:07----------
know I probably would if I had the job

---------13:09----------
of doing that I probably would take out

---------13:10----------
somebody's brain like that that's an

---------13:12----------
amazing level of proficiency I know I'm

---------13:14----------
not gonna have that proficiency so how

---------13:16----------
can I get around it so that I can still

---------13:17----------
get my job done even if I don't have

---------13:19----------
that level of proficiency and what I do

---------13:21----------
is this little tactic with the iron

---------13:22----------
where annoying you know so what I do is

---------13:28----------
this little tactic with the iron where

---------13:29----------
I'm using the elbow rather than tip so

---------13:32----------
even if somebody is ten times more

---------13:34----------
proficient than I am with hand movements

---------13:36----------
they may not be able to get the job done

---------13:38----------
because they're using a silly technique

---------13:41----------
and as time goes on you are going to

---------13:43----------
come up with techniques that allow you

---------13:45----------
to get around

---------13:46----------
whatever deficiencies you have as you go

---------13:48----------
over the course of doing your job so

---------13:50----------
here hopefully I managed to take a

---------13:52----------
negative and and turn it into a positive

---------13:55----------
and hopefully you learned something and

---------13:57----------
hopefully this has encouraged you a

---------13:58----------
little
