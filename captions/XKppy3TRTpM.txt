---------00:00----------
all right next up is in a 1502 that

---------00:03----------
claims it has no power let's try and

---------00:05----------
figure out what's wrong with this a 1502

---------00:06----------
that has no power by opening it up I've

---------00:08----------
opened up the a 1502 is no power now

---------00:10----------
we're going to plug it in and see what

---------00:12----------
happens it's the M&E amps this thing

---------00:13----------
uses if any this uses 70 milliamps but

---------00:17----------
doesn't turn on wonder if we have a

---------00:19----------
similar Alice's power good problem to

---------00:20----------
what we had before so this board is an 8

---------00:22----------
to 0 4924 where as high I would call it

---------00:25----------
a Texas Instruments graphing calculator

---------00:27----------
let's see what's wrong with this MacBook

---------00:28----------
let's go and check out our power rails

---------00:30----------
first thing we're going to check is our

---------00:33----------
pp bus all aboard the pp bus twelve

---------00:36----------
point six volts on PP bus good let's

---------00:39----------
check some other rails keep you 5vs5

---------00:42----------
it's five point two volts let's see what

---------00:45----------
we get on something like PP 5es for five

---------00:47----------
point two volts let's see what we get on

---------00:49----------
something like GP five ESO five point

---------00:53----------
two volts so it seems like we're in a

---------00:54----------
similar situation as to where we were

---------00:56----------
with that MacBook Air Board previously

---------00:57----------
we are in an Esso state if we're in an

---------01:00----------
Esso state that means all of our s 3 S 4

---------01:02----------
S 5 and G 3 hot rails are present which

---------01:04----------
bees been off the waste time checking

---------01:05----------
everything on this list because that

---------01:06----------
would be quite a bit of time so what

---------01:07----------
we're gonna do now is we're only going

---------01:09----------
to check s o rails and I'm also gonna

---------01:11----------
check the all says powered good signal

---------01:12----------
to see if that's present because when

---------01:14----------
all of our Sol rails are present all

---------01:15----------
says power good is supposed to come high

---------01:16----------
and when that comes I were supposed to

---------01:18----------
be getting CPU v core so let's take a

---------01:19----------
look or else's power good in our

---------01:21----------
schematic now you'll see that Q 8150

---------01:23----------
here is very similar to the air of the

---------01:25----------
same year it's actually the same chip in

---------01:27----------
virtually the same circuit let's see

---------01:28----------
what's going on with our else's power

---------01:29----------
good and see if my systems power is

---------01:32----------
actually all good let's get the

---------01:33----------
microscope open roll over to the AUSA's

---------01:35----------
power good area and we're missing all

---------01:39----------
this power good bosses power good is 0.1

---------01:41----------
volts no good let's go through all the

---------01:44----------
rails required so we check PP 5 ESO now

---------01:47----------
we're gonna check up the 350th tow Wow

---------01:50----------
pepper through the 3s oh is almost

---------01:51----------
everywhere pepper 3 v 3s Oh is 0.6 volts

---------01:55----------
that's

---------01:55----------
good point 6 volts I'm Peppa 3v3

---------01:58----------
yourself so now what I'm gonna do is I'm

---------01:59----------
gonna see if there's a shorter grounds

---------02:00----------
I'm Peppa through the three or so no

---------02:02----------
short to ground to kilohms that looks

---------02:04----------
fine so now we're gonna search down on

---------02:07----------
our list of rails is Pepe 3 4 3 s 3

---------02:08----------
there's pep 2 3 B 3 s floor there's pep

---------02:11----------
2 3 4 3 s 5 there and so on and so forth

---------02:14----------
now my guess is that pepper 3 4 3 s 5 is

---------02:16----------
there because pepti 3 2 3 s 5 is gonna

---------02:17----------
be used for all those PCH signals like

---------02:20----------
p.m. sleeve s4l p.m. sleep s 3o and so

---------02:22----------
on and so forth that are required to get

---------02:23----------
all the other s 4 and s 3 and s o rails

---------02:25----------
so I'm not even gonna probably not even

---------02:27----------
gonna bother to check that all right

---------02:28----------
what I am interested in is pepper 3 3 3

---------02:29----------
s for pepper 3 3 3 s 3 and what's going

---------02:32----------
on from there now just to be complete

---------02:34----------
with everything so I don't get trolled

---------02:35----------
even though I know pepper 3 B 3 is 5 is

---------02:37----------
there I'm gonna check that 2 3 B 3 s 5

---------02:38----------
just to make sure as I said I'm not

---------02:40----------
being trolled you never know when

---------02:42----------
trolling is occurring especially when

---------02:43----------
punching sweet is in your chat so we are

---------02:45----------
getting 4 pepper 3 B 3 s 5 3.30 5 volts

---------02:48----------
now we're gonna check up to 3 B 3 s for

---------02:52----------
3.3 now we're gonna eject pepper 3 over

---------02:54----------
3 s 3 epithelia s 3 can be found up here

---------02:57----------
pepper 3 V 3 s 3 is there I actually

---------03:00----------
kind of started to like the RGB started

---------03:02----------
to grow on me RGB RGB RG e

---------03:12----------
makes me happy what we need to do here

---------03:14----------
is figure out where Peppa 3b 3sl comes

---------03:16----------
from so we have to find out where it's

---------03:18----------
created so that means going through the

---------03:19----------
entire schematic piece by piece and

---------03:22----------
searching now this is where people 3 as

---------03:25----------
I was going into something not

---------03:26----------
interested in that not interested in

---------03:29----------
that all the things I'm clicking past

---------03:31----------
right now is our P P 3 P 3 s o is going

---------03:33----------
into something I want to see what P P 3

---------03:35----------
V 3 s I was coming out of so that I can

---------03:37----------
see what's creating it I understand

---------03:40----------
here we go 3 V 3 s so switch this is

---------03:42----------
gonna be what allows Peppa 3 V 3 s o to

---------03:44----------
be created so when you have a signal

---------03:46----------
here at the on pin pepper 3 V 3 s o is

---------03:49----------
gonna turn off let's take a look at what

---------03:50----------
you a t30 looks like on this board it's

---------03:52----------
gonna be right in the middle section

---------03:53----------
over here

---------03:54----------
this thing over here is gonna be

---------03:55----------
responsible for creating pepper through

---------03:57----------
the three SS so what we need to do here

---------03:58----------
is see if we're getting pepper 3 B 3 s

---------04:00----------
Oh enabled the signal that tells it to

---------04:01----------
turn on so that can be measured right

---------04:03----------
under the chip on this capacitor over

---------04:05----------
here let's measure it on that capacitor

---------04:10----------
hmm 3.3 volts so it's being told to

---------04:14----------
create it but it's not creating it very

---------04:16----------
interesting now the voltage pound ep 3 V

---------04:19----------
3 s 5 goes in and then keep these 3 v 3s

---------04:21----------
o FET is supposed to come out but it

---------04:24----------
doesn't which means that most likely our

---------04:25----------
issue is with this little chip does it

---------04:28----------
look bad at all

---------05:51----------
by the way if you're watching this video

---------05:53----------
on Vimeo you may notice that the quality

---------05:55----------
it looks better than it does on YouTube

---------05:56----------
check out her junior comm / Ross group

---------05:59----------
or you can go to boards dot Rossman

---------06:00----------
group comm we can browse through every

---------06:03----------
single one of our logical order pair

---------06:04----------
videos by either the model number of the

---------06:06----------
board or the type of the problem don't

---------06:08----------
delay check us out at Boyd's dot Rossman

---------06:11----------
recom today to find our videos without

---------06:15----------
ads and higher video quality

---------06:22----------
bye-bye little chip

---------06:29----------
you bastard

---------06:34----------
stay you bastard

---------07:00----------
flux that's so good we'll post noid

---------07:02----------
steals it every time you've a it's

---------07:03----------
chipped alright so we're gonna plug this

---------07:05----------
thing in let's see what we get on output

---------07:06----------
PP 33 s o is 3.3 volts beautiful all sis

---------07:10----------
is 3.3 volts beautiful the final test

---------07:15----------
this is how we know that this is

---------07:17----------
actually done fan spin so it seems like

---------07:21----------
we were grabbing 70 to 90 ml amps which

---------07:23----------
is common when you're missing one of the

---------07:24----------
Esso rails but the other SL rails are

---------07:26----------
present that's been a pattern that I've

---------07:27----------
talked about in many of the soo rails

---------07:29----------
missing videos I've talked about how it

---------07:31----------
is you can hook up the DC power supply

---------07:32----------
to the machine you could just look at my

---------07:33----------
video on how to hook up a macbook

---------07:35----------
charger to a DC power supply this way

---------07:37----------
you can read exactly how many amps are

---------07:39----------
being used it's helpful in

---------07:40----------
troubleshooting and I went to alters

---------07:42----------
power good and I noticed that all the

---------07:43----------
rails were present besides one and that

---------07:45----------
also power grid was missing we then

---------07:46----------
traced back so P P 3 P 3s I was missing

---------07:49----------
P V 3 V 3 s5 is present P P 3 P 3 S 4

---------07:51----------
and 3 or present VP 3 V 3 s our current

---------07:54----------
was not so we checked for a short

---------07:55----------
circuit to ground there was no short

---------07:56----------
circuit to ground meaning the rail was

---------07:58----------
just likely not being created so when we

---------07:59----------
look at the schematic this is gonna be

---------08:01----------
the junction at which P P 3 V 3 s 5 is

---------08:04----------
going to turn to pp 3 V 3 s up now we

---------08:08----------
had to see if this chip is being told to

---------08:09----------
turn on thank you very much UK Ross NATO

---------08:11----------
it's very kind you we saw that this

---------08:12----------
enable was present so it says P 3 B 3 s

---------08:15----------
Oh enable that's going to the on pin of

---------08:17----------
the chip which is gonna be that

---------08:18----------
obviously the pin that turns it on you

---------08:20----------
don't got to be an electronics engineer

---------08:21----------
to figure that one out

---------08:22----------
and you a t30 over here was broken even

---------08:25----------
though it didn't look broken it was

---------08:27----------
broken and when we replaced it we got

---------08:28----------
fan spins as they have fan spin we can

---------08:30----------
be guaranteed that this works without

---------08:31----------
any sort of further testing and quality

---------08:33----------
assurance and if you want to watch these

---------08:34----------
videos in higher quality check out the

---------08:37----------
vimeo.com slash Rossman group where you

---------08:38----------
can watch them with no pre-roll or post

---------08:41----------
roll or banner ads on the video itself

---------08:43----------
higher bit rates better streaming and

---------08:45----------
above all you can see onboard Strassman

---------08:48----------
group comm where all these videos

---------08:50----------
including the last 5 years in the

---------08:51----------
archive are not only sorted by board

---------08:53----------
model number they're also sorted by

---------08:55----------
board problem type and their hosts are

---------08:57----------
they're just the case YouTube decides to

---------08:59----------
be a fuck-boy and do something screwy so

---------09:01----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------09:03----------
you learned something
