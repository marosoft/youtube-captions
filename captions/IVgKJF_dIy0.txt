---------00:00----------
hi today I'm going to go over a MacBook

---------00:01----------
Air that wasn't turning on I'm not going

---------00:03----------
to do it in real time because I was busy

---------00:06----------
and I also had more as video

---------00:08----------
problems which I'm pretty excited that

---------00:09----------
I've solved I've switched over from

---------00:11----------
using ffmpeg to VLC so it doesn't

---------00:14----------
there's some issue with video for Linux

---------00:16----------
drivers with ffmpeg again god bless

---------00:18----------
ffmpeg god bless the fact that it is

---------00:20----------
free and that is a bunch of cool

---------00:22----------
but it doesn't always work so moving on

---------00:26----------
so this is not going to be real time but

---------00:28----------
I am going to walk you through the

---------00:29----------
things that I did the troubleshooting

---------00:31----------
steps that I took one of the first

---------00:32----------
things you should look for if the

---------00:33----------
computer charges the battery and it

---------00:35----------
seems to charge the battery it doesn't

---------00:37----------
seem like it's really that liquid

---------00:39----------
damaged it seems like everything is in

---------00:40----------
good condition but it doesn't turn on is

---------00:43----------
do I have a working 5 volt rail so there

---------00:47----------
are different power rails in the machine

---------00:48----------
this SOS 3s 5 and these are power States

---------00:51----------
so you have s 5 which is all if you have

---------00:53----------
s 3 which is sleeping in you have SL

---------00:55----------
which is on so even if you do have your

---------00:58----------
5 volt rail and your 3.3 volt rail do

---------01:01----------
you have s o versions of those so you

---------01:04----------
have this sleeping version of that rail

---------01:06----------
but then when the computer actually is

---------01:07----------
time to turn on and the fans that's been

---------01:09----------
in the CPU to work there's a separate

---------01:11----------
version of that rail that gets derived

---------01:13----------
from the original S 5 rail so you'll

---------01:15----------
have the S 5 rail which is pretty much

---------01:17----------
the 5 volts of the 3 volts that's

---------01:18----------
showing up while it's off or sleeping

---------01:20----------
and then from that rail there's a little

---------01:22----------
switch that gets clicked that says ok

---------01:24----------
now it's time for the s o version of

---------01:26----------
that to turn on and the S o version is

---------01:27----------
what's going to send power to the CPU

---------01:29----------
and all the other stuff so that the

---------01:30----------
computer can actually start computing

---------01:32----------
and working now in this case there was 5

---------01:33----------
volts but there was not 5 volts for the

---------01:36----------
s o rail and I'm going to go through a

---------01:38----------
little bit of the troubleshooting

---------01:39----------
process and what I did to figure out

---------01:41----------
what was wrong so let's turn over to the

---------01:44----------
schematic here I have to do the video

---------01:48----------
all the way over there or else you won't

---------01:49----------
see me because the light is so

---------01:50----------
ridiculously blinding from my table that

---------01:53----------
when I'm next to it in regular light you

---------01:55----------
practically can't see me alright

---------02:04----------
so now I had pp5 es3 this is let's

---------02:10----------
search for that

---------02:25----------
let me open the boy view so I can

---------02:27----------
actually find out where that I was

---------02:29----------
coming from so I can show you that okay

---------02:35----------
so you 7501 okay okay so here is where

---------02:49----------
the pp 5vs5 comes from right here you

---------02:52----------
can't see that zoom via reg 5 PP 5vs5

---------02:58----------
so I have that voltage that voltage is

---------03:00----------
there but I don't have PP 5 ESL I mean

---------03:03----------
if PP 5 ESO is what's going to get bits

---------03:06----------
it's powering all these different

---------03:08----------
components in the machine look again

---------03:09----------
keyboard backlight you need you you

---------03:12----------
don't need that to be on when the

---------03:14----------
computer is off that's why there's

---------03:15----------
different power rails for the different

---------03:16----------
power states to the Machine again do you

---------03:18----------
want your keyboard backlight on when

---------03:20----------
your computer is off no which is why

---------03:22----------
there's a separate PP 5 vs o and PP 5 es

---------03:25----------
5 so let's keep scrolling down here to

---------03:27----------
see where PP 5 vs o comes from if we

---------03:30----------
scroll down eventually we'll find it by

---------03:32----------
the way if you want to know what how I

---------03:34----------
know what power voltages need to be here

---------03:36----------
what voltages need to be where there's a

---------03:37----------
list so see this list over here all this

---------03:39----------
crap this is literally just a list of

---------03:41----------
the different power lines that are in

---------03:44----------
the machine so you can see if they're

---------03:46----------
there like it starts with the important

---------03:47----------
1 PP but G 3 ha which is what everything

---------03:49----------
winds up coming from in the machine you

---------03:51----------
check that and you can just go down the

---------03:53----------
line here checking that all these

---------03:54----------
voltages are here so what you're going

---------03:55----------
to do is you can hit ctrl F you're going

---------03:57----------
to type this in here you're going to see

---------03:59----------
what component it's hanging off of and

---------04:01----------
then you go to the board view and then

---------04:03----------
you see what where that is and then you

---------04:05----------
measure for it so that's pretty much

---------04:07----------
that

---------04:07----------
so let's so for example let's say you

---------04:11----------
want it to see if P P 3 V 4 to

---------04:12----------
underscore g3 hottest there let's just

---------04:14----------
see P 3 V 4 to underscore g3 hot right

---------04:18----------
just going to enter in

---------04:22----------
and eventually you'll find something

---------04:25----------
that is hanging off so again you can do

---------04:27----------
this really with anything well let's

---------04:28----------
just let's just check in at you

---------04:31----------
nineteen fifty right I'm just choosing

---------04:34----------
any point so you go here you see you

---------04:36----------
nineteen fifty okay that's this little

---------04:40----------
piece of crap over here alright and then

---------04:45----------
you find out which tab of it has pp

---------04:48----------
three okay so it's this tab now you

---------04:50----------
don't know this because it's not in

---------04:52----------
front of you but this small component

---------04:53----------
actually is not going to have the it's

---------04:56----------
not going to have pro legs that you can

---------04:59----------
see so you'll have to find a pro point

---------05:01----------
now in this program on the bottom over

---------05:02----------
here it's going to show you the probe

---------05:04----------
points let me just lift this up a little

---------05:05----------
so you can see so right over here it

---------05:07----------
says probe 853 you can't see that but

---------05:09----------
hopefully you trust me that I'm not

---------05:10----------
bullshitting you and you do this and

---------05:13----------
it's going to show you where that probe

---------05:14----------
point is so I can go over here where

---------05:16----------
it's red and lit up like this over here

---------05:19----------
and then I can just measure here and go

---------05:21----------
is pp 3 V 4 2 g 3 H there is three point

---------05:24----------
42 volts over here and if it is there

---------05:26----------
great that's a power supply can check

---------05:27----------
off my list if it's not there then I

---------05:29----------
know that that's what I got to start

---------05:30----------
trough troubleshooting and or you can

---------05:33----------
just do this this is a cool thing with

---------05:34----------
this program you go P P 3 V 4 2 G 3 8

---------05:38----------
it'll actually show you every place on

---------05:40----------
the board where this pops up so you'll

---------05:42----------
see it in green and cool you know it's

---------05:44----------
pretty cool so that's by the SMC where

---------05:46----------
there's a lot of three point 42 volts

---------05:48----------
and yeah that's that's that so alright

---------05:51----------
again Adam sell these I don't

---------05:53----------
redistribute them in any way I simply

---------05:55----------
purchase them off of places on the

---------05:57----------
internet where it's available to any Tom

---------05:59----------
Dick or Harry with a PayPal account and

---------06:01----------
then I just use them for the educational

---------06:05----------
and again I I don't redistribute these

---------06:08----------
in any way shape or form do not ask for

---------06:10----------
them I do not redistribute them I simply

---------06:12----------
purchase them off of the internet you

---------06:13----------
can simply google for a schematic and

---------06:16----------
there are places where any Tom Dick or

---------06:18----------
Harry could spend 20 bucks and they send

---------06:21----------
you the schematic and the board view so

---------06:22----------
that you can use them and in this case

---------06:24----------
I'm using this for the educational

---------06:26----------
purpose of teaching you how to

---------06:27----------
troubleshoot a dead board so back to my

---------06:29----------
PP 5 ESO so I had PP 5 es 5 and measure

---------06:32----------
that and then all the places PP 5 ESL

---------06:35----------
was supposed to be I didn't get it one

---------06:37----------
of the places that I measure for pp5 ESO

---------06:39----------
on this machine is actually on the fan

---------06:40----------
connector because it's just the first

---------06:41----------
thing that pops into my head as soon as

---------06:43----------
you plug the newer airs in they turn on

---------06:45----------
so the cool thing about the newer air ii

---------06:47----------
you plug the power adapter in you don't

---------06:49----------
have to go around trying to find

---------06:50----------
the two pads too short to turn it on or

---------06:52----------
you get a keyboard the thing about these

---------06:54----------
airs is that they turn on and the second

---------06:56----------
power is attached so if you attach power

---------06:58----------
the second you attach this magazine if

---------07:00----------
it knows switch me to s ou turn the

---------07:02----------
on and so if I don't have power in the

---------07:05----------
fan connector at that point I know that

---------07:07----------
this is something wrong so let's see

---------07:11----------
where PP five ESO gets started

---------07:14----------
now one of the things you should know

---------07:16----------
about most of these chips is that they

---------07:17----------
have something called enable pen zone

---------07:19----------
let me show you what that means all

---------07:23----------
right let me show you something so right

---------07:26----------
over here where it says en si this stuff

---------07:28----------
right over your en 1 en tu usually

---------07:31----------
there's 3.3 volt with these enable pins

---------07:33----------
there's usually 3.3 volts that enable

---------07:35----------
pin that's going to tell to turn on

---------07:37----------
sometimes it's a lower voltage sometimes

---------07:38----------
it's a higher voltage it really just

---------07:40----------
depends on the chip that you're using

---------07:41----------
and what you're doing is making sure I'm

---------07:42----------
still recording because I don't trust

---------07:44----------
this computer and that's pretty much

---------07:47----------
that

---------07:47----------
so if you're not getting a voltage one

---------07:48----------
of the things that you should do is see

---------07:50----------
if it's actually enabled so one of the

---------07:53----------
things I was doing once is looking for

---------07:56----------
PP 5 ESO the first thing I want to do is

---------07:57----------
see how it is created where it comes

---------07:59----------
from so let's find that alright

---------08:12----------
yawn yawn yawn this is a finding all the

---------08:20----------
stuff that pp5 ESO is powered off of but

---------08:23----------
I'm not finding where it comes from okay

---------08:25----------
here we go okay see this 5v esos which

---------08:28----------
you see what I was talking about so I

---------08:30----------
have power I have power when it's in the

---------08:32----------
s5 state which is not on but I don't

---------08:35----------
have any power in the esos state when

---------08:36----------
it's off that's no good that's worthless

---------08:38----------
that's useless to me so I need the S Oh

---------08:40----------
so here is P p5 ESO out right we zoom in

---------08:44----------
a little more because I know that the

---------08:45----------
setup sucks balls for showing you stuff

---------08:47----------
on the screen

---------08:48----------
pp five es up this is fed by also I had

---------08:55----------
voltage here right

---------08:56----------
I had pp 5v underscore s 4 RS 3 so this

---------09:00----------
was actually sure this crap of showing

---------09:02----------
up wasn't showing up as this p5 vs o

---------09:05----------
underscore again remember what I said

---------09:07----------
you should always look for these enable

---------09:08----------
tabs so if you have a certain voltage

---------09:10----------
that's not showing up see what's

---------09:12----------
producing that voltage enough for the

---------09:13----------
chip that's producing that voltage has

---------09:14----------
an en tab or even if an on tab or

---------09:17----------
something like that like you know turn

---------09:19----------
on use your common sense and say maybe I

---------09:21----------
want this is not working

---------09:22----------
maybe there's no voltage at the enable

---------09:24----------
tab at the on 10 and again he sometimes

---------09:26----------
it's called en sometimes it's called on

---------09:28----------
the reason I know this is because it

---------09:30----------
says over here this voltage going in

---------09:31----------
says en so even if I didn't suddenly

---------09:34----------
realize that Oh N means on like turn on

---------09:36----------
vs. turn off I could simply look over

---------09:39----------
here and see that the voltage here is

---------09:41----------
says en so that's what the signal is for

---------09:43----------
it's to enable and again if you truly

---------09:45----------
don't understand what this means see

---------09:47----------
this number over here the great thing

---------09:49----------
about Google the great thing about

---------09:50----------
Google on the internet is that you can

---------09:52----------
find and answer to almost anything again

---------09:53----------
just like I found this schematic - by

---------09:55----------
doing a simple Google search I can also

---------09:57----------
for a lot of these chips find data

---------09:59----------
sheets on them now you when you get a

---------10:01----------
data sheet for these chips you're going

---------10:02----------
to get some 70-page nightmare of

---------10:06----------
information that you probably are not

---------10:08----------
going to know anything about unless

---------10:09----------
you're a damn PhD in engineering but you

---------10:12----------
don't need that what I look for is the

---------10:14----------
description of what the pins do so I'll

---------10:15----------
go to the pin out and we'll describe but

---------10:17----------
each pin does at a tab so if I go let's

---------10:19----------
say pin 2 on and it goes when this goes

---------10:22----------
to 3.3 volts it enables the chip

---------10:25----------
you know I learned something so again if

---------10:27----------
you don't know what this does hit ctrl K

---------10:29----------
you can again I was trying to figure out

---------10:31----------
how to use VLC to do some of the things

---------10:33----------
I want and I have some form questions

---------10:34----------
and the answers weren't really helping

---------10:36----------
me so I used I use this I went ctrl C

---------10:41----------
and I typed in something and I Google

---------10:43----------
then I found information and again you

---------10:44----------
have the same power so long as you have

---------10:46----------
an internet connection so let's follow

---------10:49----------
the rabbit hole this is what I call

---------10:50----------
going down the rabbit hole you have a

---------10:51----------
problem and you just kind of dig down to

---------10:54----------
find and down deeper and deeper and

---------10:56----------
deeper to try to find out what to do so

---------11:00----------
P P P v vs o underscore yet what creates

---------11:06----------
that signal okay and you have all these

---------11:10----------
rails that you're going to need not

---------11:12----------
turning on and they're all coming off of

---------11:14----------
here so this is coming off of here to

---------11:16----------
create the so this is coming off of here

---------11:20----------
to create the 5-volt enable this is

---------11:22----------
coming off of here to make the three

---------11:23----------
volt enable this is coming off here to

---------11:25----------
make the 1.5 volt enable voltage and

---------11:28----------
again these are all going to be going to

---------11:29----------
their respective ICS and telling them

---------11:31----------
turn the on and start making power

---------11:33----------
it's all coming from here and when I

---------11:35----------
measured over here

---------11:36----------
I got 0 I got nothing on the output and

---------11:39----------
they also had nothing over here on this

---------11:41----------
input of p.m. sleep s3 this resistor was

---------11:44----------
good all of these resistors I measured

---------11:46----------
they were just fine and dandy so and now

---------11:49----------
this chip is powered off of 3.3 volts

---------11:51----------
and since most enables our work off of

---------11:53----------
3.3 volts my best guess as to what this

---------11:55----------
does again I'm guessing because I have

---------11:58----------
no idea what you eight 180 does I don't

---------12:00----------
and I googled and I looked and I

---------12:02----------
couldn't find anything my guess is that

---------12:04----------
when a certain input signal comes in it

---------12:05----------
takes that 3.3 volts and just sends it

---------12:07----------
this way or this power just allows the

---------12:11----------
chip to tell it to send this this way

---------12:13----------
whatever whatever the it does I

---------12:14----------
honestly don't even know I don't really

---------12:16----------
give a what I thought I could do

---------12:18----------
since the enables on all these pins of

---------12:20----------
3.3 volts is short this to this very

---------12:22----------
very high tech repair again right now

---------12:24----------
I'm the proper thing to do the proper

---------12:27----------
thing to do is figure out why this sleep

---------12:29----------
signal why this is the widest hole

---------12:30----------
is not working why when I plug the

---------12:32----------
 power in why it doesn't send the

---------12:34----------
Esso enables and why doesn't turn on

---------12:36----------
that's the right thing to do

---------12:37----------
the wrong thing to do

---------12:39----------
the wrong thing to do is the short that

---------12:41----------
3.3 volts over here so that all these SM

---------12:44----------
enables our on/off time

---------12:50----------
so yeah I want them doing

---------12:53----------
and that's what I wound up doing because

---------12:56----------
again I need the machine to turn on I

---------12:57----------
need to do something because when I

---------12:59----------
follow further down the rabbit hole here

---------13:00----------
and I go p.m. sleep s3l let's see so

---------13:06----------
that input signal that comes in here

---------13:08----------
comes from the CPU let me tell you I

---------13:11----------
don't want to troubleshoot why my CPU is

---------13:13----------
not putting out a sleep signal that's

---------13:15----------
not really how I want to start my day I

---------13:17----------
don't know I'm I'm again I don't I'm not

---------13:20----------
gonna remove the CPU I don't plan on

---------13:22----------
balling the see battle I don't I don't

---------13:24----------
want misery I want to figure out what

---------13:26----------
the actual problem is here first so what

---------13:28----------
I did I just again I just wanted to see

---------13:30----------
where I stand at this point I want to

---------13:32----------
figure out how much time am I going to

---------13:33----------
waste on this motherboard how miserable

---------13:35----------
is this board going to make me so what I

---------13:37----------
decided to do was short these two

---------13:40----------
together so that the machine would

---------13:42----------
always be on so it doesn't matter it

---------13:44----------
doesn't matter if you want to be asleep

---------13:45----------
it doesn't matter if you want to

---------13:46----------
hibernate it doesn't matter if you want

---------13:48----------
to take a nap or go on a low-power mode

---------13:50----------
 you you're staying on SO all the

---------13:52----------
time so I shorted that 3.3 volts to here

---------13:54----------
and it turned on as soon as I hit the

---------13:57----------
power button which is gray which is

---------13:58----------
beautiful which is amazing but it would

---------14:01----------
turn on and boot and then turn off then

---------14:03----------
turn on then turn off then turn on then

---------14:06----------
finally stay on so we're doing that

---------14:08----------
thing where we turn on turn off turn on

---------14:10----------
turn off and then it finally turn on and

---------14:12----------
stay on and everything worked I tried it

---------14:14----------
it truly did work beautifully but again

---------14:17----------
it's on SO all the time so I had it so I

---------14:20----------
charged it to 100% battery I let the

---------14:22----------
thing sleep on my table let's go back to

---------14:25----------
this view here oh so yeah I let it

---------14:29----------
charge overnight I let it sleep on my

---------14:30----------
table and what do you think happened

---------14:32----------
when I came back it was at 18 percent

---------14:34----------
battery so I had this thing asleep on my

---------14:36----------
table all night in a sleep on my table

---------14:38----------
all night I came back 18 percent battery

---------14:41----------
which is just complete poor so it

---------14:43----------
could give us again SOS it's always in s

---------14:46----------
oh all those SLE power rails are always

---------14:48----------
on and always being used so the battery

---------14:50----------
ran out completely almost completely

---------14:52----------
then I decided let me reset the

---------14:54----------
parameters for the help let me try

---------14:55----------
resetting P Ram I reset the P Ram and

---------14:57----------
instead of doing that were

---------14:58----------
aboot 'add into in a loop it like would

---------15:00----------
boot and stop the boot them stopped boot

---------15:02----------
did stop it would just boot instantly

---------15:04----------
and after I reset the PRM I figured

---------15:06----------
me let's see if that helped with the

---------15:08----------
whole sleep signal crap I removed that

---------15:10----------
little solder blob that he saw and it

---------15:12----------
worked

---------15:13----------
did a little rebooting thing I've reset

---------15:15----------
PRM again and it worked now here's the

---------15:17----------
thing

---------15:17----------
resetting PRM is what I needed to do to

---------15:19----------
fix this problem but how do I reset the

---------15:21----------
PRM on a computer that doesn't turn on

---------15:23----------
so that's why I forced it to turn on so

---------15:25----------
I forced it to turn on it you

---------15:27----------
you're getting s o power whether you

---------15:28----------
like it or not I turned it on I reset

---------15:31----------
the P Ram then after I recent appear and

---------15:33----------
I remove that solder blob because again

---------15:35----------
this computer is going to have

---------15:36----------
battery life if it's in soo all the time

---------15:38----------
like the computer is sitting there off

---------15:39----------
and the SL power rails are working

---------15:41----------
that's no good and now it works

---------15:44----------
beautifully and again this is why you

---------15:45----------
really this is why you got to use your

---------15:47----------
brain this is why I'm always trolling

---------15:48----------
and saying use your brain because you

---------15:50----------
know that I have so many people saying

---------15:52----------
like I don't have 5 volts what is the

---------15:54----------
vault that I see that creates 5 volts

---------15:56----------
again I showed you the IC that creates 5

---------15:58----------
volts it's fine it works great it's not

---------16:00----------
the IC that creates 5 volts that was a

---------16:02----------
fault I shown you the chip that takes

---------16:05----------
that sleep signal and sends it on to

---------16:06----------
create those enable voltages that turn

---------16:08----------
all these chips on that wasn't at fault

---------16:10----------
none of those resistors around were at

---------16:11----------
fault you know people like they get this

---------16:13----------
tunnel vision mindset where it's like

---------16:15----------
you know this creates 5 volts and

---------16:18----------
there's no 5 volts here so the thing

---------16:20----------
behind it must be the thing that's

---------16:21----------
broken no no no it's not that easy it

---------16:23----------
doesn't it's not that easy it's almost

---------16:25----------
never that easy you don't get for the

---------16:26----------
problem to be that easy don't do these

---------16:28----------
monkey-see monkey-do tricks this you

---------16:30----------
know like I saw this person fixed their

---------16:33----------
computer for not turning on that way so

---------16:34----------
I'm going to do the same thing but don't

---------16:36----------
apply somebody else's solution to your

---------16:37----------
problem you may have a different problem

---------16:40----------
with me but what I mean what I'm trying

---------16:41----------
to do with this channel is I'm trying to

---------16:42----------
encourage you to go down the rabbit hole

---------16:44----------
and figure out your specific problem

---------16:46----------
rather than simply read some silly guide

---------16:48----------
or somebody else's post and how to do

---------16:50----------
something if you want a great example of

---------16:52----------
a complete [ __ ] go to MacRumors

---------16:54----------
and read the SMC troubleshooting thread

---------16:56----------
again god bless the people in this

---------16:58----------
thread truly god bless the people in

---------16:59----------
this thread that are helping people that

---------17:02----------
are giving the way their information for

---------17:03----------
free and trying to make the world a

---------17:04----------
better place through having more fixed

---------17:06----------
computers I support that but at the same

---------17:08----------
time it's like 90 people all screaming

---------17:11----------
at once

---------17:12----------
you know asking questions that and then

---------17:15----------
they're getting answered by other

---------17:16----------
questions and then they're trying stuff

---------17:19----------
that other people tried like I don't

---------17:20----------
have three volts because our 50 was 57

---------17:23----------
was bad and then they change our 57 and

---------17:26----------
then you know it still doesn't work

---------17:27----------
because our 57 was was their problem

---------17:29----------
like not yours you need to solve your

---------17:31----------
problem I can't tell you like it very

---------17:33----------
often I'm not replacing chips to solve

---------17:35----------
these problems most of the time I'm not

---------17:36----------
replacing a chip to solve problems

---------17:39----------
because the chips themselves very often

---------17:41----------
are just fine

---------17:42----------
the problem is somewhere else and it's

---------17:44----------
just it's your job to go down the rabbit

---------17:46----------
hole and find it
