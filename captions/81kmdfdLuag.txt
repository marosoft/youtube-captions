---------00:00----------
okay today we're going over an 820 3115

---------00:03----------
board that was totally dead it had no

---------00:04----------
green light in the charger no voltage

---------00:06----------
anywhere on the board and what we found

---------00:07----------
was that it was because of a short to

---------00:09----------
ground on the main DC and rail so just

---------00:11----------
they go over here to the computer and

---------00:13----------
the PDF reader so that I can show you

---------00:14----------
what was wrong let's switch over here so

---------00:17----------
over here on the power system

---------00:18----------
architecture for an 820 3115 the AC

---------00:21----------
adapter comes in and then goes to f6 905

---------00:23----------
now on this side right over here on the

---------00:26----------
other side of F 6 9 05 there was a zero

---------00:28----------
ohm short to ground so I did what I tell

---------00:31----------
you guys to do when there's a short to

---------00:32----------
ground and I put power in the board from

---------00:34----------
the power supply so I attached the

---------00:35----------
positive probe of this to that fuse and

---------00:39----------
I attached the negative end or the

---------00:40----------
ground and to a screw hole in the board

---------00:42----------
and what I notice is regardless of how

---------00:44----------
much power I put in the Boyd never got

---------00:46----------
hot in none of the components got hot

---------00:48----------
which meant this the grid short to

---------00:50----------
ground is not on the component it was

---------00:52----------
actually inside of the motherboard and

---------00:54----------
that's no good so let me show you what

---------00:56----------
it is we did to get around that so this

---------00:58----------
rail so let's go to the board view so

---------01:01----------
you can see the board view here now on

---------01:09----------
the board view what I did is I just did

---------01:11----------
this and it's going to show me

---------01:13----------
everywhere in the board that shows up so

---------01:15----------
that shows up first at the dcn board

---------01:18----------
fuse if you aren't good at pac man in

---------01:23----------
the 80s you're not going to be good at

---------01:24----------
navigating this board view software so

---------01:26----------
it shows up on f6 905 then it goes down

---------01:29----------
here to the input of the pp 3 V 4 2

---------01:31----------
power supply by our 6990 then it goes

---------01:35----------
over here to the ISL 6259 circuit to

---------01:39----------
provide 16 volts over here it goes to

---------01:41----------
this FET that provides the 16 volts from

---------01:43----------
the charger through the buck converter

---------01:45----------
that the ISL 6259 is controlling it goes

---------01:48----------
over here to the voltage divider that

---------01:50----------
feeds the gate of this of this of this

---------01:54----------
MOSFET over here and it goes to this

---------01:57----------
diode DC 7005 which feeds 70 r70 10

---------02:04----------
which is for charger ACN and it also

---------02:07----------
goes to the SMC DC and sense which

---------02:09----------
senses the amount of voltage on the DC

---------02:11----------
and rail so let's just show you that in

---------02:13----------
the PD

---------02:13----------
Oh is I just doing Oh what was I

---------02:32----------
Oh short to ground all right so short to

---------02:34----------
ground over here so this is PPD CNG

---------02:37----------
three hot from the charger this was

---------02:38----------
short it's a ground and over here that

---------02:40----------
feeds this voltage divider with our 7010

---------02:43----------
and our 7011 that goes to the charger AC

---------02:45----------
and pin now you it needs to see four

---------02:47----------
vaults here before the ISL 6259 will

---------02:50----------
shoot at smc bc AC okay which is needed

---------02:52----------
for the one wire circuit to work if

---------02:53----------
you're kind of confuses what the one

---------02:55----------
wire circuit does you can check the out

---------02:56----------
the one wire circuit videos on this

---------02:58----------
channel so if you guys watch that video

---------03:01----------
on the no backlight because of the

---------03:04----------
backlight shorted to ground inside the

---------03:05----------
board you probably have an idea of what

---------03:07----------
i'm going to do at this point and here

---------03:09----------
is what i did so we took all the stuff

---------03:12----------
that was running along that line so from

---------03:15----------
here that were short it's a ground then

---------03:16----------
we decided to create a new path for it

---------03:17----------
so this here is where the fuse was for

---------03:22----------
dcn that little wire goes around here

---------03:28----------
and to the fuse which is professionally

---------03:31----------
mounted on the fan the fuse then goes to

---------03:35----------
the inrush limiter which is also

---------03:38----------
professionally mounted on the fan that

---------03:41----------
then goes over to the ISL circuit area

---------03:44----------
over here so this is where the voltage

---------03:47----------
divider is for the gate of that limiter

---------03:49----------
to turn it on so this is going to be for

---------03:51----------
the gate of that mosfet over there it

---------03:53----------
also goes to this diode over here so you

---------03:55----------
have the fuse going to the diode where

---------03:57----------
that's going to be going to the voltage

---------03:59----------
divider of this resistor and i believe

---------04:01----------
the one right next to it for charger ACN

---------04:04----------
now that is also going to smc DC and I

---------04:08----------
sense over here for the scent of so that

---------04:12----------
the smc can tell the exact voltage on

---------04:13----------
the DCM board and that's also going to

---------04:15----------
the other side of the board where the

---------04:17----------
input to the pp 3 V 4 2 circuit is right

---------04:20----------
here

---------04:26----------
and let's see what the result of that is

---------04:28----------
do you think that my Frankenstein board

---------04:30----------
works one way to find out so we have a

---------04:32----------
ram stick plugged in there we have a

---------04:35----------
speaker we have these en bord a fan and

---------04:40----------
a screen so let's plug it in and see

---------04:43----------
what we get so we have a green light

---------04:53----------
give a fan spinning we have a nice long

---------04:57----------
dong now we have a screen which pretty

---------05:00----------
much means that this is good obviously

---------05:02----------
yeah you have to run a SD and all that

---------05:04----------
other good stuff but just seeing the

---------05:06----------
naughty before you even get the dong and

---------05:08----------
before you even get the screen just

---------05:09----------
seeing a fan spin on a board that looks

---------05:11----------
like this is pretty fun and I will

---------05:14----------
follow up with some high resolution

---------05:15----------
pictures to put in the video because

---------05:17----------
this is definitely one that's going in

---------05:18----------
on the wall so let's just get the let's

---------05:25----------
get the focus going here

---------05:35----------
you

---------05:48----------
now one thing to note about this is that

---------05:51----------
the fan is no longer a customer or

---------05:54----------
technician serviceable part and I'm

---------05:57----------
totally okay with that because that's

---------05:58----------
the direction that Apple has actually

---------05:59----------
been asking that we all head and I feel

---------06:01----------
like I'm just kind of stepping ahead or

---------06:03----------
just a little bit ahead of them in

---------06:05----------
following their lead so first the

---------06:07----------
battery was not user removable then they

---------06:09----------
made the drive not user replaceable by

---------06:11----------
making it a proprietary type of drive

---------06:12----------
instead of using the standard PCI

---------06:13----------
Express m2 slot then they decided that

---------06:16----------
oh the keyboards going to be riveted

---------06:17----------
into the machine so you can't replace it

---------06:19----------
then they decided to make the battery

---------06:21----------
glued into the machine to the riveted

---------06:22----------
keyboard under the trackpad so that you

---------06:24----------
can't replace the battery the keyboard

---------06:26----------
the trackpad then the screen instead of

---------06:28----------
having a screen that screws into the

---------06:29----------
computer they have that'd he's the one

---------06:30----------
then they made even one step worse the

---------06:32----------
retina so you know what I'm doing I'm

---------06:33----------
step I've taken a step in the right

---------06:35----------
direction here this fan is no longer

---------06:37----------
user replaceable which actually puts me

---------06:40----------
ahead of where they are with the rent in

---------06:42----------
the new air because in those models the

---------06:44----------
fan is user replaceable but here you

---------06:46----------
want that fan replaced good luck
