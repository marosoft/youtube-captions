---------00:00----------
hi today we're gonna fix yet another

---------00:03----------
dead MacBook here we have an a 1706

---------00:06----------
macbook pro touch bar that's not turning

---------00:08----------
on this is one of those machines that

---------00:10----------
has USB C ports in the side of the

---------00:11----------
machine it's known for things like it's

---------00:13----------
soldered on SSD sending 52 volts of the

---------00:15----------
CPU because the CPU data line is right

---------00:17----------
next to the backlight power line and the

---------00:19----------
keyboard dying for no reason as well as

---------00:21----------
being one of the only laptops made in

---------00:23----------
modern times that was recalled because

---------00:25----------
opening and closing the machine will

---------00:28----------
kill it

---------00:28----------
one of Apple's best works let's open it

---------00:31----------
up and see what's wrong with it okay

---------00:41----------
let's see how many amps this thing is

---------00:46----------
taking

---------00:53----------
it's taking 20 mil amps at 20 volts so

---------00:58----------
the cd32 15 is do appear to be

---------01:00----------
communicating but it's not turning on

---------01:03----------
now the next thing that I would do at

---------01:05----------
this point is check one of the primary

---------01:07----------
voltages which would just so happen to

---------01:09----------
be our pp bus now remember these that

---------01:12----------
thing is not going to show you the

---------01:13----------
amperage taken because the power supply

---------01:15----------
is not actually being used here and so

---------01:16----------
I'm just gonna close that program since

---------01:18----------
having it open is pointless if I don't

---------01:20----------
have the power supply attached to the

---------01:21----------
USBC cable because that that takes that

---------01:24----------
that's too confusing for me so I use

---------01:26----------
this little USB C ammeter with an apple

---------01:28----------
charger

---------01:30----------
one of the few Apple products I own

---------01:32----------
makes me sick to my stomach you know it

---------01:35----------
looks like our pp bus is 12 volts and it

---------01:41----------
also looks like somebody has arrived

---------01:42----------
that may have my food is that a man with

---------01:48----------
my food it looks like our pp bus is

---------01:52----------
indeed short-circuit it's a ground so

---------01:54----------
what do I mean when I say pp bus well if

---------01:57----------
we open up a schematic for the 8 to 0-0

---------02:00----------
0 to 3 9 board for the a 1706 MacBook

---------02:04----------
Pro you'll see that there's a bunch of

---------02:06----------
power rails pp bus is the voltage that

---------02:09----------
comes from the battery it's all the

---------02:10----------
voltage that goes to the battery now if

---------02:12----------
we take a look at just the PDF you'll

---------02:14----------
see that there's a page on the schematic

---------02:15----------
that has the list of power rails now

---------02:18----------
since I had my since while I turned the

---------02:21----------
when I plugged the charger in it was

---------02:23----------
giving me 20 volts I know that the main

---------02:27----------
rail that I need for this to work

---------02:28----------
PP 3v3 underscore g3 hot is go on

---------02:31----------
because if that rail was not on the cd32

---------02:34----------
15 would not be able to negotiate with

---------02:36----------
the charger that tell the charger to put

---------02:37----------
out 20 volts rather than 5 volts and I

---------02:39----------
talked about that in my prior videos

---------02:41----------
where I talked about the importance of

---------02:42----------
pp 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot that's that

---------02:45----------
set so the next rail after that is going

---------02:47----------
to be our pp bus and our PV bus is 0.4

---------02:49----------
volts it's also about 9 to 10 on short

---------02:51----------
to ground now this may be similar to one

---------02:53----------
of the videos that high probably has in

---------02:55----------
his editing queue right now most likely

---------02:57----------
on this board what winds up happening is

---------02:59----------
one of those little tantalum capacitors

---------03:00----------
decides to itself and explode and

---------03:02----------
we're gonna see if the same thing has

---------03:04----------
happened

---------03:04----------
you don't really even need a thermal

---------03:06----------
camera to find these shorts because they

---------03:07----------
wind up being so damn obvious pilot

---------03:20----------
pilot pilot where are we flying

---------03:44----------
all right let's see if we can find the

---------03:45----------
cause of the short circuit on this

---------03:46----------
MacBook over here

---------04:30----------
what's different read our main two to

---------04:32----------
three and NC five five nine and see five

---------04:34----------
five nine is what cool people use and

---------04:36----------
our ma two to three is what squares use

---------04:39----------
are you a square square be a bro

---------04:59----------
see this is something that's really

---------05:00----------
interesting about these machines now the

---------05:02----------
a 1706 in particular is a lot of the

---------05:06----------
dead boards on these are not really

---------05:08----------
water at this point they're just like

---------05:10----------
just sodomized capacitors and look at

---------05:14----------
this what is that what this this is

---------05:20----------
happening regularly on live streams now

---------05:22----------
so this is a cap a PV bus s5 CPU yeah

---------05:28----------
this is a polymer tantalum see what's

---------05:31----------
going on with this this thing 33

---------05:40----------
microfarad 16 volt and slim paulo so

---------05:43----------
this cap is made for 16 volts pp bus on

---------05:46----------
this machine is 12 volts and think

---------05:47----------
there's no water damage here I mean you

---------05:49----------
may tell me that this stuff here is

---------05:51----------
water but it's not this is just this

---------05:53----------
capacitor exploding I mean look at this

---------05:57----------
this is the machine that looks like it's

---------05:59----------
been treated pretty well on the outside

---------06:01----------
it looks nice on the inside it looks

---------06:03----------
nice you know there's no corrosion no

---------06:05----------
liquid no bugs what is this stuff houses

---------06:17----------
I mean I'm not gonna continue looking

---------06:20----------
through the board because that would be

---------06:21----------
a total waste of time how often does

---------06:25----------
this happen to your ThinkPad hi hi

---------06:28----------
how often do is open up your think pad

---------06:30----------
and it looks like this Hey

---------06:35----------
okay I did this to your USB port I sent

---------06:39----------
48 volts the high is USB port but we

---------06:42----------
don't talk about that

---------06:44----------
[Music]

---------06:53----------
on the desk I'm sitting in the worst

---------06:55----------
possible spot because that little noise

---------06:57----------
that the iron makes the speaker's

---------07:00----------
pointing right at my ear that are you

---------07:05----------
yeah this thing looks like it was welded

---------07:06----------
onto the board

---------07:07----------
Jesus well you can get this thing off

---------07:12----------
without using too much hotter there

---------07:14----------
can't we all right yeah give a little

---------07:21----------
bit of flux a little bit of wick this is

---------07:24----------
an e 1706 13.3 inch macbook pro touch

---------07:30----------
bar from 2016 with an 8 to 0-0 0 to 3 9

---------07:36----------
board but the SSD soldered onto the

---------07:41----------
board

---------07:42----------
[Music]

---------08:04----------
[Music]

---------08:49----------
now I don't move the q-tip I'm not gonna

---------08:53----------
shove it back and forth I like to roll

---------08:55----------
it so that the fibers if the fibers

---------08:56----------
happen to come off

---------08:57----------
I want the fibers to wind up wrapping

---------09:00----------
themselves around the q-tip rather than

---------09:01----------
going into the board that's my strategy

---------09:04----------
here

---------09:26----------
and dry that off

---------09:29----------
you notice the heat of the iron makes

---------09:32----------
[Music]

---------09:33----------
make it melt

---------09:38----------
now this is a really dangerous place to

---------09:41----------
use hot air it's right next to the

---------09:42----------
screen cable and everything

---------09:44----------
[Music]

---------09:56----------
[Music]

---------10:02----------
[Music]

---------10:05----------
Blair's a cleaning lady that comes once

---------10:07----------
a week you know I used to have a

---------10:10----------
cleaning lady and I came regularly I

---------10:13----------
haven't even had time to schedule but I

---------10:15----------
do need to do that because my place is

---------10:17----------
starting to look a little holy from

---------10:19----------
all the time at work

---------10:24----------
[Music]

---------10:26----------
I'm working with someone on getting my

---------10:28----------
training manual in order they can go

---------10:31----------
back to the good ol work-life balance

---------10:32----------
thing we have you know person I used to

---------10:40----------
do the customer service has been fairly

---------10:42----------
reluctant to put into we're writing what

---------10:44----------
there is to do

---------11:09----------
[Music]

---------11:16----------
[Music]

---------11:57----------
[Music]

---------12:12----------
you see if this thing turns on in a

---------12:14----------
moment just gonna have it wrap it cool

---------12:43----------
hey now if we plug in the USB si amp

---------12:48----------
meter we're getting nine hundred

---------12:52----------
milliamps which means that it is indeed

---------12:55----------
booting it's working and if we check our

---------12:58----------
PP bus the most important things you

---------13:01----------
should check every single day when you

---------13:02----------
wake up you'll see that our pp bus

---------13:07----------
voltage is a happy 13 volts so what was

---------13:11----------
wrong with this math book well this

---------13:14----------
MacBook decided to spontaneously combust

---------13:16----------
perhaps it was sick and tired of being a

---------13:18----------
MacBook and did the honorable thing but

---------13:22----------
we did drag it kicking and screaming

---------13:24----------
back to life now it works and that's the

---------13:27----------
issue this is something that I see

---------13:28----------
happening more and more with these a

---------13:30----------
1706 --is no liquid damage no drop no

---------13:34----------
scratching no scuffs just and it's

---------13:37----------
really interesting how the caps in that

---------13:39----------
specific circuits it's always the same

---------13:40----------
ones it's always one of the ones that's

---------13:42----------
either over here or over here it's

---------13:47----------
always the same - and it's interesting

---------13:50----------
that's always the same area I'm kind of

---------13:51----------
curious to figure out why

---------13:54----------
especially when it's you know just not

---------13:57----------
no liquid no nothing just poof I got a

---------14:03----------
lot of renovations that I have to do

---------14:04----------
around this place mic transmitter

---------14:07----------
doesn't work anymore how to get myself a

---------14:09----------
new air conditioner I have to make the

---------14:13----------
wall over here look a little bit nicer

---------14:15----------
change up the customer area a little bit

---------14:17----------
get a table for the zamo redo the

---------14:20----------
basement maybe eventually rent a larger

---------14:24----------
space once they're available all these

---------14:26----------
things require money but as long as

---------14:28----------
Apple is in business as long as they

---------14:31----------
design stuff like this I've got nothing

---------14:35----------
to worry about

---------14:35----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------14:38----------
you learned something
