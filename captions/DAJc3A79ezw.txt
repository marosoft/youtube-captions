---------00:00----------
all right white is eight to zero thirty

---------00:02----------
three thirty not charged first gonna do

---------00:04----------
is see how many amps it's taking so I

---------00:06----------
plug it in and there's a battery already

---------00:08----------
in this MacBook and it's taking point

---------00:12----------
one amps point one amps is not even

---------00:15----------
enough to turn the damn thing on much

---------00:16----------
less charge it alright the first thing

---------00:20----------
I'd like to do is check my pp bus what

---------00:23----------
voltage is my pp bus is my pp bus g3 hot

---------00:27----------
or g3 not this is why I couldn't get a

---------00:31----------
real TV show with Vice so I can measure

---------00:34----------
my pp bus here on r6 905 for the input

---------00:38----------
of the Pepe 3v for two circuit now we

---------00:40----------
have one point to bolts on my PP buzz

---------00:43----------
that's no good see what do I get on DC n

---------00:46----------
kind of curious what I get there okay so

---------00:49----------
the DC and is 18 volts but the pp bus is

---------00:52----------
1.2 now the first thing we're gonna do

---------00:54----------
is let's see if we have a short to

---------00:55----------
ground on the pp bus six point twenty

---------01:01----------
three million ohms there's no short to

---------01:03----------
ground but our pp bus is not there so

---------01:06----------
let's take a look at the chip that's

---------01:07----------
gonna create our pp bus the chip that's

---------01:09----------
gonna create our pp bus is going to be u

---------01:13----------
7,000 so this is where pp bus g3 hot is

---------01:16----------
created where u 7000 it's gonna take the

---------01:19----------
18 volts from the adapter and send it to

---------01:22----------
the system it's going to take that 18

---------01:24----------
volts these transistors will turn on and

---------01:26----------
then off and then on and then off as the

---------01:29----------
u 7,000 tells them to so you'll get a

---------01:32----------
spike of 18 and then 0 spike of 18 and 0

---------01:34----------
spike of 18 and 0 and through this

---------01:36----------
magical coil and with these capacitors

---------01:40----------
to ground over here what you get is an

---------01:42----------
average down 12 point 56 volts but let's

---------01:46----------
take a look at what are you 7,000 looks

---------01:48----------
like u 7,000 can be found over here on

---------01:50----------
the board you 7,000 can also be found by

---------01:53----------
heading to our website ad store dot

---------02:40----------
and if you buy in quantity you'll even

---------02:42----------
save over here at a list of compatible

---------02:44----------
boards it'll tell you what the chip is

---------02:46----------
for and we have high quality photos you

---------02:49----------
can compare it to what's on your

---------02:50----------
motherboard don't delay buy today with

---------02:53----------
that let's go back and see what it looks

---------02:55----------
like on our board that chip looks fine

---------02:58----------
nothing looks wrong with that chip it's

---------03:00----------
a lovely looking little chip why don't

---------03:02----------
you work why don't you work much sadness

---------03:06----------
well the first thing we have to do is

---------03:09----------
check out the current sensing circuit we

---------03:11----------
have to see the current sensing circuit

---------03:14----------
which is pretty cool the resistance

---------03:17----------
between pins 27 and 28 and pins 17 and

---------03:20----------
18 is what I would expect it to be given

---------03:23----------
the resistances in those areas this is a

---------03:24----------
current sensing resistor it's gonna be a

---------03:26----------
small voltage drop across at the ISL

---------03:28----------
65:9 is gonna read the drop across but

---------03:31----------
it's only gonna read the drop across it

---------03:32----------
if the pathway between the current

---------03:33----------
sensing resistors and the chip are

---------03:37----------
intact so let's check that out

---------03:39----------
good twice right yeah

---------03:45----------
sleepy pin 27 and 28 I want to go home

---------03:52----------
and see my kitty but I can't go home and

---------03:57----------
see my kitty I have to work and fix

---------04:01----------
MacBook

---------04:05----------
Masaya 3.2 all right so the current

---------04:09----------
sensing circuit is working as its

---------04:11----------
supposed to

---------04:12----------
what if it let's check everything else

---------04:15----------
around this chip alright so the first

---------04:17----------
thing I'm gonna do let's see if we're

---------04:18----------
getting the charger DC in on pin two you

---------04:24----------
get a green light

---------04:25----------
what's that green light it's not

---------04:27----------
producing anything pin two is gonna be

---------04:35----------
over here

---------04:42----------
and we get 15 volts that's actually

---------04:45----------
pretty low that's quite a bit of drop

---------04:48----------
from the 18 point 5 volts to my power

---------04:51----------
supply should be putting out so we got a

---------04:53----------
couple of options here so I was checking

---------04:56----------
for PP DC charger DC n this is where the

---------05:00----------
charger up here from adapter is going to

---------05:05----------
go to my is L to power it now that's 15

---------05:10----------
volts is a 2000 resistor and a diode

---------05:14----------
supposed to cause a drop of three and a

---------05:16----------
half volts I don't think so is my

---------05:18----------
resistor dead is my is L six two five

---------05:21----------
nine shorting nut to ground because my

---------05:22----------
is L is dead one way to find out we're

---------05:25----------
gonna check on our seven zero zero five

---------05:27----------
which can be found over here and see if

---------05:30----------
that's actually the 20 ohms that expect

---------05:32----------
to and it is and we're gonna send the

---------05:38----------
diodes probably good because the diodes

---------05:40----------
always good which means the chip may be

---------05:43----------
pulling it down let's remove that chip

---------05:46----------
that might be pulling our results down

---------05:47----------
and see if we can fix it with the new is

everything son of a [ __ ] bastard

---------06:55----------
 god damn it ah that sucks

---------06:59----------
 me what the mother piece of

---------07:09----------
 [ __ ] bastard

---------07:11----------
I knocked everything off on the bottom

---------07:17----------
don't chill while you're soldering

---------07:21----------
anymore

---------07:22----------
no shelling with soldering at the same

---------07:24----------
time son of a [ __ ]

---------08:11----------
yeah

---------09:40----------
I love my kitty my kitty is so cute it's

---------09:48----------
a kind kitty as well

---------09:55----------
okay we got some nice flux there so I

---------09:57----------
can do that now that one resistor that I

---------10:00----------
forgot about

---------10:29----------
[Music]

---------10:51----------
[Music]

---------11:01----------
and as you can see peepee bus is now g3

---------11:06----------
hot and we have a fan that's spinning I

---------11:09----------
were to measure my peepee bus my peepee

---------11:13----------
bus is gonna be a happy twelve point 56

---------11:15----------
volts look at that

---------11:18----------
12 point 55 volts and our pee pee bus so

---------11:22----------
what was going on was that we were

---------11:23----------
missing pee pee bus g3 Han the customer

---------11:25----------
said the computer would work off a

---------11:26----------
battery but it would not charge the

---------11:28----------
battery and when the battery was

---------11:29----------
discharged it would no longer work but

---------11:31----------
it would not charge a new battery so

---------11:32----------
what do we do well if it worked off a

---------11:35----------
battery PP bunch d3 hot which is applied

---------11:37----------
by the battery if the charges not

---------11:38----------
plugged in can't be shorted to ground so

---------11:40----------
we ruled that out as possibility and we

---------11:42----------
did check for a short to ground just in

---------11:43----------
case but I that wasn't gonna be the case

---------11:45----------
we check the current sensing circuitry

---------11:47----------
around the ISL six two five nine chip

---------11:49----------
aka you 7000 which is required in order

---------11:51----------
for the ISL six two five nine to create

---------11:53----------
our PP best g3 hot and that wasn't at a

---------11:56----------
wack so it wasn't the resistors of the

---------11:57----------
traces we then checked charger DC in

---------11:59----------
which with the charger is gonna be

---------12:00----------
supplying power to the ISL six two five

---------12:03----------
nine through a resistor called our

---------12:05----------
seventy twenty which is a resistor that

---------12:07----------
is going to limit the current that goes

---------12:10----------
to the ISL six two five nine on the

---------12:12----------
other side of that resistor we had a

---------12:13----------
voltage dropped from eighteen point five

---------12:15----------
volts to 15 volts which meant either a

---------12:18----------
the resistor was dead or being the ISL

---------12:20----------
sixty five and I was pulling it down

---------12:21----------
after taking a careful look the UH the

---------12:24----------
resistor was twenty ohms but the ISL six

---------12:26----------
two five nine appeared to be pulling

---------12:27----------
down that voltage and as a result of a

---------12:29----------
pull and it was pulling down that

---------12:30----------
voltage because was bad we replaced it

---------12:32----------
with one and it worked so if you need an

---------12:35----------
ISL six two five nine you can buy it at

---------12:38----------
store dot Rosman group.com don't delay

---------12:43----------
by today and we're moving on to the next

---------12:48----------
motherboard so next motherboard in our

---------12:50----------
list and go from there
