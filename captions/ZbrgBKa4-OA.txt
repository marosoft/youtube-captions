---------00:00----------
why hello it's been a while

---------00:03----------
let's fix another macbook here we have a

---------00:05----------
macbook

---------00:06----------
that needs to be fixed this is a macbook

---------00:09----------
air

---------00:09----------
this macbook air has liquid damage let's

---------00:12----------
take a look at the board

---------00:14----------
you get an idea of what's going on with

---------00:15----------
this little macbook looks like we have

---------00:17----------
some fairly obvious liquid damage up

---------00:19----------
here

---------00:22----------
you gotta say i'm loving this new lens

---------00:24----------
it does show how unsteady everything is

---------00:26----------
including my hand also sorry that i

---------00:30----------
haven't been

---------00:30----------
as frequent with videos recently it has

---------00:33----------
been very

---------00:34----------
very very very very very ungodly busy

---------00:38----------
and there's been quite a bit to do i

---------00:41----------
also had to get my

---------00:42----------
pc fixed but i finally have a nice

---------00:44----------
little water cooling setup here even if

---------00:46----------
it doesn't quite fit into this

---------00:47----------
corsair case the way i would want i

---------00:50----------
never have to worry

---------00:51----------
about my p of this machine going vroom

---------00:55----------
vroom over and over again anytime it

---------00:58----------
starts streaming

---------00:59----------
because that nmx pile of trash liquid

---------01:02----------
cooler

---------01:03----------
is now gone uh so yes i'm dumb

---------01:06----------
i'm the dum-dum that bought the innermax

---------01:08----------
liquid cooler i'm one of the five idiots

---------01:11----------
that bought that pile of crap

---------01:12----------
but it is now gone so the first thing

---------01:14----------
that rail that we need in order to get a

---------01:16----------
light in the charger

---------01:17----------
is pp3v42 underscore g3 hot let's open

---------01:20----------
up a board view

---------01:21----------
for the a20-00165

---------01:25----------
macbook macbook

---------01:28----------
macbook and see where pp3v42 underscore

---------01:32----------
g3 hot is

---------01:36----------
if you don't know why pp3p42 underscore

---------01:38----------
g3 hot is supposed to be the first rail

---------01:40----------
that shows up in this macbook

---------01:41----------
i highly suggest that you check out my

---------01:43----------
videos on the one wire circuit

---------01:45----------
on boards.rosmangroup.com because if i

---------01:48----------
explain why you need that power rail

---------01:50----------
even one more time i might just have an

---------01:53----------
aneurysm

---------01:54----------
so as you can see pp3v42 is going to be

---------01:57----------
over there

---------01:58----------
over here over there

---------02:02----------
so let's see if it's present on my board

---------02:09----------
and it's not now we're going to see if

---------02:11----------
we have a short to ground on pp3 v42

---------02:12----------
underscore g3 hot because a short to

---------02:14----------
ground can keep it from showing up

---------02:17----------
it's not shorter to ground 10 kilo ohms

---------02:20----------
hmm what could it be all right so now we

---------02:23----------
have to find the pp3 v4 to underscore g3

---------02:25----------
hawk creation circuit

---------02:28----------
and take a look around and let's see

---------02:31----------
what's

---------02:32----------
why it's not being created u790 is the

---------02:35----------
chip that's going to create

---------02:36----------
pp3 v4 to underscore g3 hot and it needs

---------02:38----------
to be getting voltage as it's enabled i

---------02:40----------
mean

---------02:40----------
it's enable and its input pin as can be

---------02:43----------
seen over here

---------02:44----------
the voltage in pin is pin six and it's

---------02:47----------
supposed to be getting

---------02:48----------
either 8.6 volts from the battery on its

---------02:52----------
pp

---------02:52----------
g3 hot or if the battery's dead it's

---------02:54----------
supposed to be getting 18.5 volts

---------02:56----------
from the charger let's see what it's

---------02:58----------
getting on pin 6.

---------03:00----------
we're going to move the microscope over

---------03:08----------
wow much corrosion

---------03:14----------
much corrosion

---------03:18----------
let's see what we're getting on input

---------03:20----------
seems like we're getting 0.1

---------03:23----------
millivolts on input

---------03:34----------
hmm no good we checked over over here

---------03:39----------
on the diode pin three i wonder if

---------03:41----------
there's a short to ground over there

---------03:43----------
because do keep in mind there are not

---------03:44----------
just capacitors on output

---------03:46----------
there are also capacitors on input

---------03:49----------
capacitor c7091 capacitor c7090

---------03:54----------
and capacitor c7092 so that can actually

---------03:57----------
be shorted to ground as well

---------03:59----------
we're going to put our multimeter back

---------04:00----------
into impedance mode resistance mode

---------04:03----------
hashtag resist mode and see if we have a

---------04:07----------
short to ground over there

---------04:09----------
we don't 5 kiloohms to ground looks like

---------04:12----------
we have to go further up the chain and

---------04:13----------
figure out what's wrong with this

---------04:14----------
macbook

---------04:15----------
all right i'm going to plug my charger

---------04:17----------
in again put the multimeter into voltage

---------04:19----------
mode

---------04:20----------
let's see what's happening behind the

---------04:21----------
diode now i don't expect to be anything

---------04:23----------
on the pb bus yet because we need

---------04:25----------
pp3p4200

---------04:26----------
g3 hop before we get the peepee bus so

---------04:28----------
before we get to ride the pb bus

---------04:30----------
let's check out pp18v5 that's the

---------04:32----------
voltage that's supposed to be coming in

---------04:33----------
from the charger

---------04:34----------
that's supposed to be present on pin two

---------04:37----------
of the diode

---------04:38----------
and pin two of the diode is going to be

---------04:40----------
the left pin

---------04:48----------
nothing wow okay

---------04:51----------
let's continue our journey upwards

---------04:54----------
now what's feeding pin 2 of the diode is

---------04:57----------
going to be

---------04:59----------
r7005 a 10 ohm resistor

---------05:02----------
let's find that 10 ohm resistor and make

---------05:04----------
it stop resisting

---------05:06----------
so what do we have here

---------05:10----------
zero volts it's not the resistor okay

---------05:13----------
let's continue up the chain let's

---------05:16----------
continue up the chain

---------05:19----------
now q7010 is a transistor that's going

---------05:22----------
to open

---------05:22----------
and allow this to come through so let's

---------05:26----------
take a look

---------05:26----------
by making this full screen for a moment

---------05:28----------
here now

---------05:30----------
q710 is a p-channel mosfet the way a

---------05:32----------
p-channel mosfet works

---------05:34----------
it is going to allow power to go through

---------05:35----------
when the voltage on the gate

---------05:37----------
is lower than the voltage on the source

---------05:39----------
so voltage is going to go from the

---------05:40----------
source over to the drain

---------05:42----------
or current or energy or wattage

---------05:45----------
or ger i'm going to start going gur

---------05:48----------
there are some engineers watching the

---------05:50----------
channel that have gotten angry

---------05:52----------
the fact that i'll say current instead

---------05:53----------
of amperage voltage instead of amperage

---------05:55----------
power instead of amperage from now on

---------05:57----------
i'm just going to grunt

---------06:02----------
super male vitality so this

---------06:06----------
is going to allow the power to go

---------06:07----------
through when the voltage on the gate

---------06:10----------
is lower than the voltage on the source

---------06:12----------
now here we have a path to ground

---------06:14----------
for the gate r7011 and d7012 provide a

---------06:17----------
path

---------06:18----------
to ground to lower that voltage a little

---------06:20----------
bit our 7010

---------06:21----------
and r7011 are going to allow some

---------06:24----------
voltage to go to the gate

---------06:25----------
but if this diode is doing its job that

---------06:28----------
voltage is going to be brought down

---------06:30----------
by a little bit which will allow this to

---------06:32----------
open and get the job done

---------06:34----------
now the way i know this is a p channel

---------06:36----------
mosfet if you're unaware of how i would

---------06:38----------
figure that out

---------06:39----------
is by googling it so i'm going to right

---------06:42----------
click

---------06:43----------
and do that then i'm going to go over to

---------06:45----------
my web browser

---------06:47----------
and i'm going to search for it

---------06:50----------
and if you search for it the first

---------06:52----------
result on google which i should really

---------06:54----------
stop using and change it to duckduckgo

---------06:56----------
is my default because googler

---------06:58----------
is ap channel that's how i know that

---------07:00----------
it's a p channel and not an n channel

---------07:03----------
there are some people who have a brain

---------07:05----------
unlike me

---------07:06----------
who know that this is a p or an n

---------07:09----------
channel simply by looking

---------07:10----------
at the internal picture and i've been

---------07:12----------
doing this job for damn near 10 years

---------07:15----------
and i forgot how to tell don't be stupid

---------07:18----------
like lewis

---------07:19----------
but also realize that if a stupid person

---------07:20----------
like lewis can figure this out and do it

---------07:22----------
you can too but back to the schematic

---------07:25----------
now let's see

---------07:26----------
if q710 is doing its job

---------07:29----------
or if it's not being told to do its job

---------07:31----------
so i'm gonna i'm gonna check the power

---------07:33----------
at the gate and the source i already

---------07:34----------
checked the power to get at the drain i

---------07:36----------
checked it right over here and i didn't

---------07:37----------
have nothing

---------07:38----------
so we're gonna check at the gate and the

---------07:40----------
source let's go back to the view that's

---------07:42----------
split

let me pet your blackberry nobody pets

---------08:17----------
my blackberry

---------08:18----------
blackberry does not have a price how

---------08:21----------
dare you

---------08:22----------
she's my angel my princess a mere two

---------08:26----------
dollars is not going to allow you to pet

---------08:28----------
my princess

---------08:30----------
you bastard figlio de putan

---------08:33----------
pizzo de mierda you think you're cool

---------08:36----------
right

---------08:38----------
hmm when you kick blackberry out of her

---------08:41----------
house

---------08:42----------
i tell you this one in three americans

---------08:45----------
is dying out of cancer

---------08:47----------
you know [ __ ] you're going to be one

---------08:49----------
of those

---------08:50----------
i didn't have the courage to kick your

---------08:52----------
ass directly

---------08:54----------
didn't have enough courage for that but

---------08:57----------
i could

---------08:58----------
you know and so could blackberry did you

---------09:01----------
know you're going to have another

---------09:02----------
accident you know i'm involved with

---------09:04----------
black kittens

---------09:06----------
[ __ ] you die bastard you think you're so

---------09:10----------
cool

---------09:11----------
[ __ ] and if i ever see your [ __ ]

---------09:13----------
face around

---------09:14----------
in brooklyn or manhattan i'll kick your

---------09:17----------
ass

---------09:18----------
[ __ ] you [ __ ] american [ __ ] yankee

---------09:23----------
you're gonna die out of cancer i promise

---------09:26----------
deep pain no one knows what you did to

---------09:29----------
me

---------09:30----------
you want to know something [ __ ] you i

---------09:32----------
want your balls mashed

---------09:34----------
eat [ __ ] bastard pizzo de mierdo figlio

---------09:38----------
de putana

---------09:39----------
i hope somebody in your family dies soon

---------09:41----------
i hope that somebody in your family dies

---------09:43----------
soon

---------09:44----------
[ __ ] you and your two dollars

---------09:48----------
[ __ ] thinking i'm gonna [ __ ] my cat

---------09:51----------
out to you

---------09:52----------
for two dollars

---------09:56----------
what we need to do the nerd the gate as

---------09:59----------
well as the source

---------10:00----------
now one of the difficult things here

---------10:02----------
because of paul daniels software

---------10:04----------
and paul daniels's software just causes

---------10:06----------
so many problems in life

---------10:08----------
is that the transistor is going to show

---------10:09----------
up differently on the board than how it

---------10:11----------
is

---------10:12----------
in the program so on the board q7010

---------10:16----------
has four solder pads on the left and

---------10:19----------
four solder pads in the right

---------10:20----------
in this configuration however and paul

---------10:23----------
daniels is

---------10:24----------
everywhere thing upside down dingo baby

---------10:26----------
eating software

---------10:28----------
it has one pin on the top

---------10:31----------
and then three pins on the bottom which

---------10:33----------
looks nothing like this

---------10:35----------
in what [ __ ] world does this

---------10:39----------
look like this paul daniels

---------10:43----------
really now

---------10:45----------
[Music]

---------10:50----------
this isn't paul's fault these board

---------10:51----------
views just suck okay so here's what

---------10:53----------
we're gonna do here

---------10:54----------
here's what we're gonna do so i can i

---------10:56----------
don't know what the [ __ ] the gate is

---------10:57----------
i don't know which one is the gate so

---------10:59----------
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

---------11:00----------
measure something that i know is on the

---------11:01----------
gate

---------11:02----------
so for example the gate and the source

---------11:04----------
are on each pin

---------11:05----------
of c7012 c7012 is going to have one foot

---------11:09----------
on the gate and another on the source

---------11:11----------
so if i can find c7012 even if there's

---------11:13----------
nothing that is certain about this trend

---------11:15----------
where things are on this transistor

---------11:17----------
i can know whether i'm measuring the

---------11:18----------
gate of the source by clicking pin two

---------11:20----------
or one or measuring pin two and one on

---------11:23----------
the capacitor

---------11:24----------
so let's take a look at that capacitor

---------11:26----------
and see what we're getting

---------11:27----------
at these different points now on

---------11:30----------
pin 2 of the capacitor which is

---------11:34----------
supposed to be the gate

---------11:39----------
i get 18 volts and on pin one

---------11:42----------
i also get 18 volts so of course this is

---------11:45----------
not going to work

---------11:46----------
now i can't blame the transistor at that

---------11:48----------
point can't blame the transistor because

---------11:50----------
it's doing what it's supposed to do

---------11:52----------
p channel a p channel transistor means

---------11:55----------
that when you have the same voltage

---------11:59----------
on the gate and the source that's

---------12:00----------
nothing's going to go through to the

---------12:01----------
drain

---------12:02----------
can't blame it so now we've got to see

---------12:04----------
what's causing it to not make its way to

---------12:05----------
ground

---------12:06----------
so two few possibilities here

---------12:09----------
behind door number one c712 has become

---------12:13----------
short-circuited

---------12:14----------
since this c7012 is no longer a

---------12:16----------
capacitor but acting as a wire

---------12:18----------
it is taking whatever's in the source

---------12:19----------
and always bringing it to the gate all

---------12:21----------
the time

---------12:22----------
behind door number two r7011 has decided

---------12:26----------
that it's going to die very unlikely the

---------12:29----------
reason it's unlikely

---------12:30----------
is because r7011 is going to be what is

---------12:33----------
carrying

---------12:33----------
my 18 volts from the charger up here

---------12:38----------
to the gate that's unlikely behind door

---------12:41----------
number three

---------12:42----------
d70 12 has died d70 12 is no longer

---------12:45----------
allowing a path to ground

---------12:46----------
is no longer release decreasing the

---------12:48----------
voltage on the gate

---------12:50----------
and there's no and that's why the

---------12:51----------
vultures in the gate is 18. so

---------12:53----------
i'm going to bypass thinking r 7011 is

---------12:56----------
my problem

---------12:57----------
i'm going to unplug power from the case

---------12:59----------
and then

---------13:00----------
i'm going to measure the resistance

---------13:02----------
between the two pins of c7012

---------13:04----------
because if the capacitor has

---------13:06----------
short-circuited and become a wire

---------13:08----------
this would be very apparent with a

---------13:10----------
simple voltage measurement and it has

---------13:12----------
not

---------13:13----------
which means that the fault here is going

---------13:14----------
to lie with

---------13:16----------
the diode so let's take a look at where

---------13:18----------
the diode is

---------13:19----------
we're going to find this diode our zener

---------13:22----------
diode

---------13:24----------
is d7012 it's right there

---------13:27----------
and what do you know it has some green

---------13:29----------
stuff around it

---------13:31----------
now is the diode itself bad

---------13:34----------
or does the diode simply need a little

---------13:35----------
bit of reflow

---------13:43----------
now this actually looks like a defined

---------13:44----------
pathway what's corroded over here

---------13:46----------
appears to be the probe point for me to

---------13:48----------
test on

---------13:51----------
watch when i remove the diode you'll see

---------14:02----------
[Music]

---------14:15----------
so the pathway for the diode to go to

---------14:18----------
the resistor is there

---------14:20----------
thank you jp i appreciate that and the

---------14:22----------
pathway for it to go to ground is also

---------14:24----------
there

---------14:25----------
so that was not our problem at all

---------14:29----------
most likely this was just a bad diet

---------14:43----------
man being the madman that i am

---------14:46----------
i am going to top on it tap on the top

---------14:48----------
of that diode

---------14:52----------
ah is that too loud for you games with

---------14:56----------
c's

---------15:11----------
the [ __ ] out of there you little green

---------15:13----------
solder ball

---------15:16----------
little green solder ball invading my

---------15:18----------
board like little green men invading

---------15:20----------
crimea

---------15:20----------
get out of here

---------15:38----------
okay

---------15:55----------
the fan spins all along

---------15:58----------
all that was wrong with this liquid

---------16:00----------
damage macbook was a simple diode

---------16:03----------
that's all this macbook needed was just

---------16:06----------
a simple diode

---------16:09----------
this macbook was picked at random at no

---------16:12----------
point

---------16:13----------
in this process did lewis pick his own

---------16:15----------
machine from the queue

---------16:16----------
because that would be wrong

---------16:26----------
wrong that's it for today

---------16:30----------
and as always i hope you learned

---------16:34----------
something

---------16:47----------
listen how you how you talk about them

---------16:49----------
and how you treat them post end of

---------16:51----------
relationship

---------16:52----------
i will run you down the light is green

---------16:55----------
for me

---------16:56----------
sorry i'll show you on the gopro what i

---------16:58----------
was talking about
