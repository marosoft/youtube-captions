---------00:04----------
here we have a MacBook Pro that's not

---------00:06----------
turning on this is an a 1398 15 inch

---------00:09----------
Retina let's take a look on the inside

---------00:11----------
of it and see what's going on with this

---------00:12----------
MacBook and see if we can make it work

---------00:14----------
again 19 milliamp and not turning on all

---------00:21----------
right let's turn on the good old

---------00:23----------
multimeter turn on the Paul Daniel

---------00:25----------
software pray that it works this evening

---------00:27----------
as we always do and see what's going on

---------00:31----------
with this machine

---------00:32----------
holy moly it worked on the first click

---------00:35----------
it's a Festivus miracle

---------00:46----------
pp best g3 out of twelve point six

---------00:48----------
meaning it's not shorted to the CPU

---------00:49----------
which actually puts us ahead of most of

---------00:51----------
the thirty six sixty two boards that I

---------00:53----------
work on

---------01:02----------
over here we're gonna see if when the

---------01:05----------
board is out of the case if it turns on

---------01:11----------
and it looks like we're still getting

---------01:14----------
the same amperage usage that we were

---------01:15----------
getting before 24 million so we're gonna

---------01:19----------
take a look around this board and see if

---------01:21----------
there's any evidence of anything that

---------01:23----------
could possibly be causing this to be

---------01:25----------
occurring so we're gonna go down our

---------01:26----------
list of power rails the same way we do

---------01:29----------
usually and we're gonna open up flex

---------01:30----------
board view and we're gonna find the list

---------01:33----------
of power rails remember we have a

---------01:34----------
problem with no power so what I do if

---------01:36----------
there's a problem with no power I'm

---------01:38----------
going to go through and find the list of

---------01:40----------
power rails in the machine figure out

---------01:42----------
which power rails are not showing up and

---------01:43----------
then we're gonna chase why it's not

---------01:44----------
showing up you know one of the difficult

---------01:46----------
things to do getting into this it's not

---------01:47----------
even not wanting to do the work it's not

---------01:49----------
knowing what work it is you need to do

---------01:51----------
so I'm gonna try and make that more

---------01:53----------
obvious when we have these streams or

---------01:56----------
live discussions now as I've mentioned

---------01:59----------
me before many times the g3 hot rails

---------02:01----------
come on first then s5 then it's 4 then s

---------02:03----------
3 then SL so we check PP bus g3 hot that

---------02:07----------
was on now we're gonna check the rest

---------02:09----------
now we know that P P 3 V 4 2 is on

---------02:11----------
because I get a green light in the

---------02:12----------
charger let's see if PP v g3 hot PPV RTC

---------02:17----------
G three hottest present it looks like it

---------02:20----------
is present just fine now let's check

---------02:23----------
something like PP 5 es 5

---------02:30----------
PP 5vs5 that's one point one volts now

---------02:40----------
one point one volts is not five volts

---------02:43----------
but one thing that's interesting here is

---------02:44----------
that it's stuck at one point one now

---------02:46----------
remember the other day when we were

---------02:48----------
troubleshooting this and we had an issue

---------02:49----------
around that chip that makes the five

---------02:51----------
volt in the three volt rails what was

---------02:53----------
going on is that we had power cycling it

---------02:55----------
was going between 22 and 36 milliamps

---------02:58----------
over and over and over again whereas on

---------03:00----------
this one into steady-state 24 millions

---------03:02----------
that tells me it's likely something

---------03:04----------
different I don't think it's gonna be a

---------03:05----------
short circuit anywhere in that area but

---------03:07----------
we are going to check out that area and

---------03:09----------
see that that's still gonna be my focus

---------03:11----------
but I'm gonna focus on it and I'm gonna

---------03:14----------
well from the idea that something else

---------03:15----------
may be wrong with it so let's just go

---------03:18----------
over to that part of the board and see

---------03:20----------
what happens around you 7501 all right

---------03:22----------
so we're at u7 501 now it right around

---------03:25----------
this chip there's gonna be three enables

---------03:27----------
because remember this chip is making

---------03:29----------
three distinct different power rails

---------03:31----------
this chip is making PP 5 es 4 it's

---------03:36----------
making PP 3 V 3 S 5 and it's making PP 5

---------03:40----------
es 5 since this chipper was responsible

---------03:42----------
for three different rails it's likely

---------03:43----------
going to have three different enable

---------03:45----------
pins to enable each one separately we

---------03:48----------
have on pin for the enable pin that's

---------03:50----------
going to be used to enable PP 5 es 4

---------03:53----------
right here we have on pin 21 the voltage

---------04:00----------
the enable pin for pp 3 V 3 S 5 and on

---------04:03----------
pin 12 we have the enable pin for PP 5e

---------04:07----------
s 5 so let's check you take a look and

---------04:10----------
see what's happening here so what I want

---------04:11----------
to do is check three things a the

---------04:13----------
voltage going into the chip at pin 23

---------04:15----------
and I expect PP Bush g3 hot to be there

---------04:18----------
and this pin over here pin 23 we should

---------04:21----------
be getting 12 point 6 volts the next

---------04:24----------
thing I should be getting is enable on

---------04:25----------
pin 12 and the third thing I should be

---------04:27----------
getting is 5 volts on output and no

---------04:29----------
short to ground so what we're gonna do

---------04:32----------
so let's take a look the first thing I

---------04:34----------
want to do is see if I'm getting 12

---------04:36----------
point 3 volts on the input pin right

---------04:38----------
over there so we're gonna measure that

---------04:41----------
first

---------04:42----------
there's quite a few pubes around there

---------04:54----------
twelve point six volts is going into it

---------04:56----------
the next thing I want to do is see if

---------04:58----------
the chip is being told to turn on so

---------05:00----------
here my light bulb

---------05:02----------
you know the electricity's work and I

---------05:04----------
got Troy got volt power going to my

---------05:06----------
light bulb now I want to see if the

---------05:08----------
light switch has been flipped if we have

---------05:10----------
three point three volts on pin twelve

---------05:11----------
that's similar to the light switch being

---------05:13----------
flipped remember I can't blame the chip

---------05:15----------
for the fact that the rail is missing

---------05:17----------
the same way I can't blame a light bulb

---------05:19----------
for the fact that it's not a mini light

---------05:20----------
if the switch is down and here the

---------05:22----------
version of the switch being down is

---------05:23----------
gonna be that the enable pin of that

---------05:25----------
chip does not receiving the power

---------05:27----------
required to turn it on and tell it hey

---------05:28----------
chip

---------05:29----------
turn on same way it's you know though

---------05:31----------
once you flip the switch light bulb turn

---------05:34----------
on so let's see what we're getting over

---------05:36----------
there so on this pin on pin twelve which

---------05:40----------
is over here according to my schematic

---------05:44----------
and board view ten twelve I am

---------05:47----------
we should be getting 3.3 volts and we

---------05:54----------
are however our output of PP 5 es 5 is

---------06:02----------
still one point one volts now when you

---------06:05----------
look at this area do you see anything

---------06:06----------
interesting anything here that sticks

---------06:10----------
out to you at all

---------06:22----------
it looks like this MacBook has had quite

---------06:25----------
a few pubes inside of it before you

---------06:28----------
notice that there's many pubes

---------06:29----------
however those pubes eventually turned

---------06:32----------
into what looks like a smudge of egg

---------06:35----------
salad or something over here gross so we

---------06:40----------
are going to remove the egg salad from

---------06:42----------
this MacBook and once you remove the the

---------06:45----------
egg salad from it it may work so I'm

---------06:48----------
going to turn on my fume extractor I

---------06:51----------
have a hack ofa 4:30 that I use for this

---------06:54----------
because I don't want to breathe this

---------06:55----------
stuff in and I think it's really

---------06:57----------
important if you work at a place that

---------06:59----------
does this that they get you a proper

---------07:00----------
fume extractor if you won't if somebody

---------07:04----------
owns their own business and they don't

---------07:05----------
use a fume extractor if they want to

---------07:07----------
ruin their own body and lungs that's

---------07:08----------
that's on them but I don't think that a

---------07:11----------
business owners cheapness should be the

---------07:14----------
reason that you are ruining your own

---------07:15----------
lungs at work so if you do stuff like

---------07:17----------
this and tell your boss to get you a

---------07:19----------
fume extractor and if they don't I would

---------07:22----------
suggest opening your own business or

---------07:24----------
finding a ways to get in another

---------07:28----------
business or quitting because that would

---------07:30----------
mean that they value a few hundred bucks

---------07:34----------
in their bank account over your health

---------07:36----------
and well-being and I've noticed many

---------07:39----------
businesses in this industry sadly tend

---------07:42----------
to do that and I'm not a fan of it I

---------07:44----------
makes me kind of sick so we're gonna do

---------07:47----------
here is remove this chip this is a TPS

---------07:50----------
five one nine eight zero I added a

---------07:55----------
little bit of Amtech flux there

---------08:00----------
this is the quick 861 DW hot air rework

---------08:03----------
station I believe that this is six or

---------08:06----------
eight millimeter nozzle I've got on here

---------08:08----------
right now and this hot air station is

---------08:13----------
available at store Osman group calm as

---------08:15----------
well as the chip that we're about to put

---------08:17----------
on here so I'm going to find another TPS

---------08:19----------
five one nine nine zero and if you

---------08:21----------
aren't exactly sure where to get a chip

---------08:23----------
like this if you didn't really be kind

---------08:26----------
of confused as to how this works you

---------08:28----------
7501 in it which is a TPS five or nine

---------08:31----------
eight zero on the eight to zero 30 662

---------08:33----------
board and one of the things that you can

---------08:38----------
do here if you are able to browse over

---------08:41----------
to store dot Rossmann group comm which

---------08:44----------
is pretty cool in my opinion well

---------08:46----------
somewhat biased opinion here check this

---------08:48----------
out folks watch this so you can type in

---------08:53----------
8 to 0-3 662 and for any Macbook board

---------08:58----------
it'll actually show you all the chips

---------08:59----------
that we have for that macbook forward

---------09:01----------
you just click there this BAM

---------09:05----------
everything back white fuse that's

---------09:06----------
compatible LCD filter that's compatible

---------09:10----------
and what do you know u7 501 TPS five one

---------09:12----------
nine nine zero and you click there and

---------09:14----------
we'll even tell you a list of the

---------09:16----------
compatible boards that it goes on it's

---------09:17----------
just absolutely amazing this is a one

---------09:20----------
Anik one and the kind one of a kind

---------09:22----------
website that you can only find at store

---------09:25----------
dot rossmann group.com that being said

---------09:28----------
with our shilling being complete let's

---------09:30----------
find the TPS five one nine z80 off of a

---------09:32----------
donor board because I'm too cheap to use

---------09:34----------
the chips that I actually sell to

---------09:35----------
customers we're gonna get ourselves a

---------09:42----------
chip and because I'm

---------09:49----------
now we're gonna solder it on to this

---------09:50----------
board and it's gonna work okay I've

---------09:56----------
gotten my donor chip now I'm going to

---------09:59----------
ten those pads and prepare them for the

---------10:03----------
new chip that I got here

---------10:06----------
add a little bit of soldering flux we're

---------10:11----------
gonna tin these pads

---------10:22----------
and then we're going to wick the pads

---------10:52----------
now we're going to clean the board with

---------10:54----------
an esd-safe

---------10:55----------
Sparkle paper towel from Amazon

---------11:04----------
that's an Ian look at that esd-safe

---------11:06----------
paper-towel beautiful okay

---------11:13----------
add some soldering flux and tin those

---------11:16----------
pads beautifully and prepare them for a

---------11:18----------
new chip my wife likes Apple products in

---------11:21----------
the Apple ecosystem thank you for

---------11:23----------
providing a do-it-yourself Apple repair

---------11:25----------
with the money I have saved I feel it is

---------11:27----------
only right to give back to the

---------11:29----------
information provider Thank You Lois

---------11:30----------
thank you awesome awesome robot and

---------11:35----------
thank you very much I really appreciate

---------11:37----------
that and I really hope that whatever it

---------11:39----------
was that you tried to fix that it went

---------11:41----------
well and you were able to solve your

---------11:44----------
problem and honestly this it's not even

---------11:46----------
so much the money-saving part although

---------11:48----------
that's cool there's something really

---------11:49----------
cool about seeing the fan spin again on

---------11:51----------
something that you figured out with your

---------11:55----------
own brain it's a really cool feeling and

---------11:58----------
it did genuine it just doesn't get old

---------12:01----------
like there are many parts of the job

---------12:03----------
that got old but seeing the fan spin the

---------12:05----------
satisfaction of seeing the fan spin at

---------12:06----------
the end never gets old

---------12:10----------
and I hope you enjoyed it

---------12:16----------
okay

---------13:34----------
this is the wrong iron so we're not

---------13:39----------
gonna be using the micro pencil today

---------13:41----------
because it appears that my micro pencil

---------13:42----------
tip is dead and those things cost fifty

---------13:45----------
five dollars

---------13:46----------
I don't particularly feel like spending

---------13:49----------
fifty five dollars at the moment so can

---------13:52----------
I use toothpaste for flocks and flocks

---------13:54----------
for toothpaste what what happened if I

---------13:55----------
did very bad things would happen so I

---------13:57----------
don't suggest doing that so I'm gonna

---------14:00----------
make do with this tip over here use the

---------14:02----------
angled edge of it to make sure that I'm

---------14:04----------
getting into all the joints that I need

---------14:17----------
beautiful

---------14:21----------
this is obviously not the ideal tip for

---------14:23----------
what I'm doing but my other one broke

---------14:25----------
and I'd like to show you that even if

---------14:26----------
you don't have the perfect tool for the

---------14:28----------
job at the moment that there are ways to

---------14:30----------
improvise I'm not saying you should

---------14:32----------
always use the wrong tool nor am I

---------14:33----------
saying that you should let a substandard

---------14:35----------
job leave your facility just that every

---------14:38----------
now and then you're gonna have to use a

---------14:39----------
little bit of ingenuity to make

---------14:40----------
something work so that you can get work

---------14:43----------
done and that it is possible to rather

---------14:45----------
than saying damn it I don't have what I

---------14:47----------
need I guess there's nothing I can do

---------14:50----------
the happy little message of

---------14:51----------
encouragement there okay

---------14:57----------
so we've replaced the chip and we've

---------14:58----------
removed the potato salad from the board

---------15:00----------
now that there's no more potato salad on

---------15:02----------
the board I'm curious to see if this

---------15:04----------
board will function so I'm going to wrap

---------15:06----------
it cool the board using rapid cool

---------15:09----------
technology rapid cool technology

---------15:39----------
okay so we're gonna turn off the rapid

---------15:41----------
cool technology catch the board is it

---------15:43----------
false and we're gonna see if it turns on

---------15:47----------
can i edit videos for use as rockford

---------15:49----------
tech well I'd have to figure out and set

---------15:51----------
up a way to actually send you video

---------15:53----------
files and one of the problems with that

---------15:54----------
is that these files are like 50 100 50

---------15:58----------
gigabytes per border pair and that I

---------16:01----------
can't send that a Time Warner also a

---------16:03----------
high high our store video editor

---------16:06----------
actually has something he'd like to tell

---------16:07----------
you there's that as well so what hi I

---------16:15----------
just said it's a given that you would be

---------16:18----------
replacing him and getting rid of his job

---------16:23----------
now if you're willing to work for

---------16:24----------
cheaper than hi hi mister Yazoo then so

---------16:30----------
now we're gonna plug this thing in see

---------16:31----------
how many amps is taking and see if it

---------16:32----------
turns on let's see if we get the magical

---------16:35----------
fan spent

---------16:43----------
as you can see the fans are spinning

---------16:45----------
which means that our work here is done

---------16:47----------
so the issue with this machine was that

---------16:50----------
it was not turning on and it was taking

---------16:52----------
23 male amps now unlike the machine from

---------16:55----------
yesterday whereas taking 23 male amps

---------16:57----------
and then spiking the 38 million every

---------16:59----------
time the other rails are coming on this

---------17:01----------
one was just stuck at 22 milli amps 22

---------17:03----------
mil and what was happening here is our

---------17:05----------
five volt rail was not turning on and

---------17:08----------
our five volt rail was not turning on

---------17:10----------
because there appeared to be an

---------17:12----------
abundance of pubes and also some egg

---------17:15----------
salad right by our TPS 5.98 zero chip we

---------17:19----------
replaced it I showed you how we went

---------17:20----------
about troubleshooting that how we went

---------17:22----------
out about finding the rail that was

---------17:23----------
missing and how he went about replacing

---------17:25----------
that chip using tools that are all

---------17:27----------
available that stored out Rossmann

---------17:29----------
group.com and we've also got this

---------17:32----------
beautiful water bottle here have to have

---------17:35----------
to show every single video this is a

---------17:37----------
water bottle that's a schematic sure dye

---------17:38----------
featuring my kitty mr. Clinton you can

---------17:41----------
see that unlike the old merchandise I

---------17:43----------
was selling I've actually had his ass

---------17:46----------
redrawn in this video and this in this

---------17:50----------
piece of merchandise here

---------17:58----------
so you can

---------18:04----------
as you can see here this water bottle

---------18:07----------
unlike our old merchandise has mr.

---------18:09----------
Clinton's ass fully drawn so you can see

---------18:13----------
the entirety of mr. Clinton the kitty

---------18:15----------
that says schematics or Die this kitty

---------18:18----------
asks you to support the right to repair

---------18:21----------
he's my cat his name is Clinton and he's

---------18:25----------
featured on this water bottle that's it

---------18:28----------
for today and as always I hope you

---------18:30----------
learned something as I said I'm gonna

---------18:31----------
try to keep up a Daily board repair

---------18:33----------
video from the queue and with any luck

---------18:35----------
there will be some lessons and

---------18:37----------
interesting useful tidbits that you

---------18:39----------
could learn from watching
