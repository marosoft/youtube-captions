---------00:00----------
all right so we're going to try to turn

---------00:01----------
on this MacBook Air over here and see

---------00:03----------
what happens as you can see when I try

---------00:05----------
to turn it on the fan doesn't spin it's

---------00:08----------
dead now if we were to take a look at

---------00:11----------
this under the microscope real quick

---------00:13----------
you'll notice that a familiar culprit

---------00:15----------
appears to look a little bit

---------00:18----------
questionable but I'll let you be the

---------00:21----------
judge

---------00:21----------
hmm what's up with that well I do

---------00:28----------
believe we have a job to do here be a

---------00:34----------
hunting jtag connector

---------00:35----------
[Music]

---------00:44----------
so it's time take our revenge on the

---------00:49----------
jtag connector

---------00:52----------
and she will do like so

---------01:20----------
dai jtech Dai Dai jtech

---------01:32----------
you and your pads can all go to hell

---------02:01----------
I don't care about a single pad on this

---------02:05----------
JPEG connector I don't care about the

---------02:07----------
connector I don't care about the traces

---------02:10----------
going to the connector I don't care

---------02:12----------
about this cloud or joins on the

---------02:14----------
connector I don't care about the

---------02:16----------
usability of the connector I want this

---------02:23----------
connector to feel pain suffering anguish

---------02:26----------
sorrow loneliness irritation

---------02:43----------
so we're back

---------02:49----------
sadly it appears that we may actually

---------02:51----------
have to use our brain for this one well

---------02:53----------
I was hoping not to have to do that

---------02:55----------
alright let's take it apart and see what

---------02:58----------
we get

---------03:21----------
now I know that I've got PP 3v4 to

---------03:24----------
because I have a green light my charger

---------03:26----------
which means the one wire work it circuit

---------03:28----------
and the SMC you're working so let's

---------03:32----------
check out the rest we're going to check

---------03:35----------
out pp bus g3 hot over here and alright

---------03:50----------
let's arrange 8.58 volts here zero volts

---------03:58----------
here alright so there we go

---------04:01----------
so we have a blown fuse 4 PP bus g3 hot

---------04:04----------
that is our first problem and that is

---------04:10----------
going to be F 71 40 over here so now I

---------04:15----------
have to see if there's a short to ground

---------04:17----------
on the system side of PP bus g3 hot that

---------04:19----------
would cause less use to blow excuse is

---------04:22----------
not going to blow for no reason so if I

---------04:24----------
take my red probe of my multimeter and

---------04:26----------
put it to ground in my black probe and I

---------04:28----------
put it to the fuse you'll see that we

---------04:30----------
have a zero direct zero voltage drop the

---------04:33----------
ground direct short now before I go nuts

---------04:36----------
trying to inject voltage into the board

---------04:39----------
to find where the short is I might as

---------04:41----------
well just take a brief look over the

---------04:43----------
board and see if anything looks out of

---------04:48----------
place to me that's a capacitor that's

---------04:51----------
exploding a chip that has a hole in it

---------04:54----------
anything that's going to give us a hint

---------04:56----------
and as to why this has happened so we

---------04:59----------
look by the CPU capacitors to see if any

---------05:02----------
of them is exploding common cause

---------05:08----------
look on the other side of the board here

---------05:17----------
it's a good idea to look around before

---------05:19----------
you inject voltage

---------05:53----------
alright nothing here is looking too

---------05:55----------
obviously messed up so let's remove our

---------05:57----------
fuse inject some voltage and see what we

---------06:00----------
get now we're not going to want to start

---------06:02----------
with more than 1 volt just in case any

---------06:04----------
one of the transistors for the CPU is

---------06:07----------
broken because then we would be

---------06:08----------
injecting a high amount of voltage into

---------06:10----------
the CPU do do note that this rail is

---------06:13----------
responsible for just about every other

---------06:15----------
rail on the machine so if we have a chip

---------06:17----------
that's trying to turn eight volts in a 1

---------06:19----------
volt and it's shorted it's going to send

---------06:21----------
the 8 volts directly to whatever is in

---------06:25----------
front of it so if that's something like

---------06:27----------
say the CPU you don't want to inject

---------06:29----------
voltage into here and then have that go

---------06:31----------
directly to the CPU because of a blown

---------06:33----------
fat that would be very bad that fuse is

---------06:36----------
gone

---------06:40----------
[Music]

---------06:55----------
[Music]

---------06:59----------
and I use this as my ground now I'm

---------07:03----------
going to take my power supply here

---------07:07----------
[Music]

---------07:14----------
okay

---------07:15----------
[Music]

---------07:16----------
power supply grounds out of to this

---------07:18----------
ground and then we're going to solder

---------07:20----------
the power supply positive to where our

---------07:23----------
short look is located

---------07:24----------
[Music]

---------07:38----------
now to see what gets warm because you

---------07:42----------
never know if my one volt is making the

---------07:46----------
CPU warm then I know what is shorted the

---------07:52----------
CPU is as cold as ice so that's most

---------07:55----------
likely not our problem let's turn up the

---------07:57----------
voltage just a little bit here can you

---------07:59----------
see what's getting hot here let's try

---------08:01----------
something we're going to put a little

---------08:02----------
bit of alcohol on the board we're going

---------08:06----------
to see where it evaporates so I think

---------08:13----------
it's something over here ooh see this

---------08:21----------
yeah

---------08:31----------
that is not a happy capacitor it's

---------08:35----------
sizzling

---------08:41----------
Tassadar at all so we're going to do is

---------08:43----------
we're going to repeal and replace with

---------08:46----------
the better one

---------08:52----------
come on

---------08:55----------
you can mouth off the board

---------09:02----------
and our short is gone no more power is

---------09:05----------
passing through

---------09:06----------
[Music]

---------09:13----------
[Music]

---------09:23----------
and this time we're going to be neat

---------09:24----------
about it

---------09:27----------
[Music]

---------09:29----------
and this side over here

---------09:31----------
[Music]

---------09:36----------
that's all we need not barely small

---------09:40----------
little clump

---------09:45----------
[Music]

---------09:51----------
[Music]

---------10:04----------
there we go nice and clean now we're

---------10:10----------
going to get a new PP bus G three hot

---------10:11----------
views this area over here needs a fresh

---------10:14----------
fuse

---------10:17----------
[Music]

---------10:41----------
[Music]

---------11:01----------
that's what we call fan spin and that is

---------11:03----------
a fixed board and as always I hope you

---------11:06----------
learned something now time for an

---------11:07----------
advertisement this is our website here

---------11:09----------
mail in dot repair you will be able to

---------11:12----------
find on most of the different cleaners

---------11:14----------
stencils connectors ICS and small chips

---------11:18----------
that we use throughout these repairs on

---------11:19----------
this website so here you'll find the

---------11:22----------
ultrasonic cleaner that we use at the

---------11:23----------
store that's fixed many other boards

---------11:25----------
that I was unable to fix in the video

---------11:26----------
this here is shipped straight from the

---------11:28----------
store here you'll see a bunch of LCD

---------11:30----------
connectors

---------11:31----------
we've got keyboard connectors we've got

---------11:34----------
digitizer connectors and they're all

---------11:35----------
organized here so if you go connectors

---------11:37----------
by type or you can search by your device

---------11:40----------
if we go here components by device

---------11:42----------
iPhone iPhone 6's it'll bring you to a

---------11:45----------
screen where you'll find a bunch of

---------11:47----------
different parts for your iPhone the same

---------11:49----------
is true for stencils you've got stencils

---------11:51----------
over here like the SMC stencil that it's

---------11:53----------
typically hard to buy directly in

---------11:55----------
America you have to wait a long time to

---------11:56----------
get that from China here we've got the

---------11:59----------
some different parts like the LPP 3v4 to

---------12:02----------
regulator over here so this is a TP 3

---------12:05----------
before to regulator you can actually

---------12:07----------
search by the number on the schematic

---------12:09----------
and if there are different ships with

---------12:11----------
that same number it'll bring up all the

---------12:12----------
different ships you can scroll down and

---------12:14----------
figure out which one is for your

---------12:16----------
motherboard because over here it'll say

---------12:17----------
compatible boards and it will list all

---------12:19----------
the boards the chip is compatible with

---------12:21----------
if you don't want to deal with that you

---------12:23----------
can even just search by your motherboard

---------12:24----------
so if I search over here for a t20 3462

---------12:27----------
it will only show me chips that are

---------12:29----------
compatible with my model motherboard and

---------12:33----------
this was all put together with

---------12:35----------
high-resolution pictures that you can

---------12:37----------
compare it to your chip to make sure

---------12:39----------
that you buy the right one and if you

---------12:41----------
ever have a question feel free to email

---------12:42----------
feel free to comment feel free to live

---------12:44----------
chat so thank you very much for watching

---------12:46----------
the video thank you very much for your

---------12:48----------
patronage if you use our website we've

---------12:50----------
also got flux here if you want flux

---------12:52----------
we've got solder paste over here if you

---------12:55----------
want solder paste and we've even got

---------12:58----------
mouse pads with pictures of my [ __ ]

---------13:02----------
of a cat
