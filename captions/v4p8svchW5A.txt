---------00:00----------
okay today we're going to make humble

---------00:01----------
quarter fan spin quarter fan spin is the

---------00:03----------
worst problem on a macbook motherboard

---------00:05----------
for a couple of reasons the first reason

---------00:06----------
it's a big nightmares because quarter

---------00:08----------
fans been can be caused by anything and

---------00:10----------
I do mean anything secondly since the

---------00:13----------
family spends for a quarter of a spin

---------00:15----------
certainly goes from that gives you this

---------00:17----------
much time to measure voltage this much

---------00:19----------
time to measure clock signals so it

---------00:21----------
becomes a complete nightmare and a real

---------00:22----------
test of how much you know about how the

---------00:24----------
system and how it works and what makes

---------00:26----------
it tick because again quarter fan spin

---------00:28----------
can literally be anything and it's a

---------00:31----------
royal penalty an so to give you an idea

---------00:32----------
of what quarter fan spin is right over

---------00:34----------
here let's plug this in and show you

---------00:37----------
what happens when i plug it in so when i

---------00:45----------
plug it in

---------00:55----------
awful absolutely awful and the worst

---------00:58----------
part about this is this board was clean

---------01:00----------
by another repair shop now the reason

---------01:01----------
wholesale business sucks the reason

---------01:03----------
dealing with other repair shops sucks is

---------01:05----------
because they're going to clean

---------01:06----------
everything before you get to see it so

---------01:07----------
you're not going to see with the

---------01:08----------
original damages since you don't see

---------01:10----------
with the original damages it's hard to

---------01:11----------
know where to start and knowing that

---------01:12----------
quarter fans been can be anything makes

---------01:15----------
this a real nightmare so let's

---------01:18----------
go into the microscope and try to

---------01:19----------
reverse-engineer and figure out what

---------01:21----------
exactly happened here before it was

---------01:23----------
 with by whoever decided to send

---------01:25----------
it to me so let's zoom out so everything

---------01:29----------
here is firstly everything here is kind

---------01:30----------
of a mildly corroded mess that's the

---------01:32----------
first problem is that it's not really an

---------01:34----------
issue with is like one spot that's

---------01:36----------
obviously more corroded than the other

---------01:37----------
corrosion around that's kuroda that's

---------01:43----------
corroded that's corroded this is just

---------01:45----------
the steaming pile of horseshit we want

---------01:48----------
to find something that looks more

---------01:49----------
corroded than anything else so this is

---------01:51----------
not really corrosion this is just too

---------01:52----------
much time at an ultrasonic so this is

---------01:54----------
what happens when people use Windex or

---------01:56----------
dish soap and then ultrasonic and they

---------01:58----------
just leave it in there forever and ever

---------02:00----------
and ever and let's see so we have yeah

---------02:03----------
this is pretty looks nasty everywhere

---------02:06----------
but what I'm looking for I'm looking for

---------02:07----------
signs of where it started because again

---------02:09----------
 like this that that's not really so

---------02:11----------
much corrosion as it is just a sign that

---------02:12----------
it was left in the cleaner for a really

---------02:14----------
long time but people who don't know how

---------02:16----------
to use an ultrasonic cleaner so what I'm

---------02:20----------
looking for here is I'm really looking

---------02:21----------
for not just orange probe points i'm

---------02:23----------
looking for some red ones i'm looking

---------02:25----------
for something that tells me that it

---------02:26----------
wasn't just soaked in a cleaner i'm

---------02:27----------
looking for it's not just signs of

---------02:29----------
erosion meaning for example over here

---------02:32----------
you can see that the solder just kind of

---------02:34----------
eroding away i'm not looking for that

---------02:36----------
that's just signs it sat in the cleaner

---------02:37----------
for too long what I'm looking for really

---------02:39----------
hardened red probe points because those

---------02:41----------
red probe points are going to tell me

---------02:43----------
that it's not just that liquid was

---------02:44----------
applied here but that liquid was applied

---------02:46----------
here while the there was electricity

---------02:48----------
going through it like BAM here we go

---------02:50----------
zinc see that see that see that see that

---------02:52----------
right over here this is where the water

---------02:53----------
was applied during the electricity so

---------02:55----------
for example let's just find something

---------02:57----------
else to give you an idea so see how this

---------02:59----------
capacitor looks kind of nasty it's not

---------03:01----------
shiny like it should be it's not you

---------03:03----------
know that solder joint is just kind of

---------03:05----------
blair or let's find a better example

---------03:07----------
like this one that

---------03:09----------
the technically good solder joint but it

---------03:10----------
looks kind of worn away and if you're

---------03:12----------
not experienced you may think that

---------03:14----------
that's liquid damage this is not liquid

---------03:15----------
damage right here this is ultrasonic

---------03:17----------
damage this is just it's been in the

---------03:19----------
ultrasonic too long but that's not going

---------03:20----------
to necessarily destroy this resistor

---------03:22----------
that's not going to destroy the part

---------03:23----------
what we're looking for is we're trying

---------03:25----------
to differentiate the water damage from

---------03:27----------
the idiot repair shop damage so that

---------03:29----------
over there that's idiot repair shop that

---------03:31----------
there's no how to alter Sonic and

---------03:32----------
motherboard but this over here this is

---------03:35----------
the real damage so over here see that

---------03:38----------
that's the actual electricity added with

---------03:40----------
water damage so let's take a look and

---------03:42----------
see what this is for so this is right by

---------03:44----------
a coil that is used for thunderbolt

---------03:46----------
boost now here's the thing thunderbolt

---------03:49----------
boost that's not really something that's

---------03:51----------
going to cause quarter fan spin but

---------03:53----------
right over here we have a clock ship so

---------03:55----------
this is the corroded part this is not

---------03:57----------
the Kuroda part but I know that this is

---------03:58----------
right next to the part that had water on

---------03:59----------
it at the time that there was

---------04:00----------
electricity going to the Machine this

---------04:02----------
over here is an RTC clock trip this is

---------04:04----------
used for the system clock so the system

---------04:06----------
clock is going to be used for things

---------04:07----------
like high PCH talk to other components

---------04:09----------
of the machine hi PCH turn on and get

---------04:11----------
everything going so if the clock signal

---------04:12----------
is being brought down then this could

---------04:14----------
cause quarter fan Smith so let's take a

---------04:17----------
look here and see what happens if we get

---------04:19----------
rid of that so I'm going to turn on this

---------04:21----------
jbc so keep in mind this thing has been

---------04:24----------
off this is the hot air station that

---------04:26----------
just got me for my birthday thank you

---------04:27----------
very much this thing is amazing

---------04:29----------
so watch this so keep in mind it's cold

---------04:33----------
I mean I could it's a it's cold in my

---------04:34----------
office so I could have actually touched

---------04:36----------
this thing with my own with my hand and

---------04:39----------
the nozzle is cold and watch how fast

---------04:41----------
it's just going to get rid of this

---------04:42----------
little clock oh my god I mean this is

---------04:45----------
I'm not kidding this is better than sex

---------04:47----------
so hello this is this is this is

---------04:51----------
amazing and you know what the weird part

---------04:52----------
is in that in that other video that I

---------04:54----------
did I actually compared it to the Weller

---------04:55----------
and I found them to be very very similar

---------04:59----------
but for some reason in over the course

---------05:01----------
of actual use I find myself gravitating

---------05:03----------
towards the jbc even though that it is

---------05:06----------
they do they work very similarly like

---------05:08----------
when I actually time it when I seek to

---------05:10----------
to figure out how much time does it take

---------05:12----------
for things to work on both of these

---------05:14----------
stations I'm noticing that they're both

---------05:15----------
very similar but when i use it for some

---------05:18----------
reason I just the jbc is cooler I mean

---------05:21----------
it's like using you know

---------05:22----------
high-end BMW versus a Bentley I mean you

---------05:25----------
know if you're driving from Brooklyn to

---------05:27----------
Manhattan that you're 20 miles an hour

---------05:29----------
in traffic there's not really that much

---------05:31----------
of a difference between your BMW or your

---------05:34----------
Bentley like you know funky they get you

---------05:37----------
the same place to both high performance

---------05:38----------
cars they both do their job but and

---------05:41----------
Bentley is cool you know I mean I don't

---------05:44----------
know what it is but well in that car is

---------05:46----------
going to be 250 thousand dollars versus

---------05:47----------
the 80 or 90 thousand for your BMW but

---------05:51----------
it's just one of those things I mean

---------05:52----------
they measure very similarly I shouldn't

---------05:55----------
really be so much attracted to one over

---------05:57----------
the other the same way I shouldn't be

---------05:59----------
using this iron versus the micro pencil

---------06:01----------
to be working on that but what the hell

---------06:03----------
but but if for some reason i like it so

---------06:06----------
much more and this is something that I

---------06:08----------
could have never bought myself so it's

---------06:10----------
not because I can't afford it it's

---------06:11----------
because I did actually buy that myself I

---------06:13----------
would never forgive myself because I

---------06:15----------
would have spent about twelve hundred

---------06:16----------
dollars more on a station that is the

---------06:18----------
exact same thing that the other one does

---------06:19----------
and even though that this thing is so

---------06:21----------
much just it's called the jbc JT dash

---------06:25----------
hey even though this thing is just so

---------06:27----------
much cooler feeling it just makes me

---------06:29----------
happier inside I would never be able to

---------06:31----------
actually enjoy that had I paid for it

---------06:33----------
myself just knowing that I could get the

---------06:36----------
exact same down in the exact same

---------06:38----------
time frame in the exact same quality

---------06:41----------
with my Weller I wouldn't but buttress

---------06:44----------
but it just feels so much nicer and

---------06:46----------
again I can't put it into words because

---------06:47----------
you know I really can't like they heat

---------06:50----------
up in the same amount of time they're

---------06:51----------
they're both strong they both have hand

---------06:55----------
pieces that feel similar but for some

---------06:56----------
reason using this is just a pleasure and

---------06:59----------
that's something I didn't anticipate

---------07:01----------
when I did that jbc review and also when

---------07:04----------
I did the JBC versus well review I like

---------07:05----------
using this thing more and trust me JB

---------07:07----------
sees not paying me to say that they're

---------07:09----------
they're really not I mean like after you

---------07:12----------
know I you demo thirty two hundred

---------07:14----------
dollars worth of gear and you send it

---------07:15----------
back saying I'm not really interested in

---------07:17----------
this stuff because it works very

---------07:18----------
similarly to my other stuff which costs

---------07:20----------
a lot less money that those are the

---------07:21----------
magic words you tell the company if you

---------07:23----------
never want them to speak to you again so

---------07:25----------
I mean you know trust me jbc ain't

---------07:28----------
paying me but and it's one of those

---------07:31----------
things that you kind of get out of a

---------07:32----------
long-term demo versus a short-term one

---------07:34----------
so in the short term the

---------07:36----------
differences between the jbc and the

---------07:37----------
Weller seemed really minor but in a long

---------07:39----------
term the difference between the jbc ha

---------07:40----------
there on the Weller hot air is just I

---------07:42----------
don't know it could be in my head here's

---------07:45----------
that's the thing maybe it's in my head

---------07:47----------
maybe it's because I know that jbc is

---------07:49----------
more expensive that I like it or maybe

---------07:50----------
it's something that I'm failing to

---------07:52----------
properly define but whatever it is I

---------07:58----------
don't find that to be true with the

---------07:59----------
soldering iron I really truly believe in

---------08:01----------
granted it could be because i don't have

---------08:03----------
the soldering iron here for a long term

---------08:04----------
demo i really found the i like I'm

---------08:06----------
really happy with my well er I mean my

---------08:08----------
with my hack 0 FX 951 and the soldering

---------08:11----------
iron with it I don't find there would be

---------08:13----------
any functional difference between that

---------08:15----------
and the jbc one I don't they just they

---------08:17----------
work the same to me but the hot air

---------08:18----------
station the hot air that's just

---------08:19----------
something else entirely this this just

---------08:26----------
makes my life easier in a way that I

---------08:28----------
would have never dreamed possible

---------08:38----------
I never thought I could be in love with

---------08:40----------
a hot air station you know like things

---------08:45----------
like love and marriage and you know

---------08:48----------
those are things that you usually

---------08:50----------
reserved for a significant other but I

---------08:55----------
mean I love this jb see if it had a hole

---------09:01----------
i would have sex with it in fact it does

---------09:02----------
it actually has this thing it's funny

---------09:04----------
that I said that because it has a hole

---------09:06----------
in the front of it and it says suction

---------09:09----------
with a green button and man you know a

---------09:15----------
guy can dream anyway

---------09:31----------
so get a fan

---------09:50----------
no more quarter fan spin let's go over

---------09:56----------
in the schematic what I did and why I

---------09:59----------
did what I did and let's also open up

---------10:02----------
the board view software because the

---------10:03----------
board view software is going to be very

---------10:04----------
telling as to why I did what I did ok

---------10:10----------
let's open the proper software for this

---------10:12----------
model 820 2936 that was so according to

---------10:24----------
the open broadcaster clock that was

---------10:26----------
quarter fans been solved in nine minutes

---------10:27----------
and 56 seconds that is cool so over here

---------10:31----------
on the screen ahem i said on the screen

---------10:36----------
oh you're capturing the wrong screen

---------10:39----------
aren't you you are there we go ok on

---------10:45----------
this screen so let's open up this is

---------10:52----------
bored view over here now I when I looked

---------11:00----------
around the board the extra the real

---------11:02----------
nasty corrosion was over here and you

---------11:03----------
can't see that because the graphics in

---------11:05----------
this program is screwed up anytime you

---------11:06----------
resize this window you actually have to

---------11:08----------
reopen the file that's because it's from

---------11:10----------
the 1995 and hasn't been updated so

---------11:13----------
these are the two resistors that look

---------11:14----------
nasty and these are with Thunderbolt see

---------11:16----------
you it says t20 9029 on the bottom here

---------11:18----------
that's the Thunderbolt boost circuit

---------11:19----------
that is nothing to do with what we're

---------11:20----------
talking about but I know that because

---------11:22----------
that had the red probe points that this

---------11:24----------
is where the liquid god while the

---------11:25----------
electricity was going through it so this

---------11:27----------
gives me a hint now Thunderbolt is not

---------11:29----------
going to cause quarter fan spin but

---------11:30----------
system clock so you have to think about

---------11:33----------
this for a second think about it

---------11:34----------
logically so that's it this is corrosion

---------11:36----------
right by a 25 megahertz system clock and

---------11:38----------
also by sis clock RTC which is a 32

---------11:42----------
killer at system clock so if your fan

---------11:44----------
think about your fan is spinning like

---------11:45----------
this for like the really smallest piece

---------11:48----------
of a quarter of a second and you have a

---------11:49----------
clock that's going to turn on and you

---------11:52----------
know 25 megahertz there's 25 million

---------11:54----------
cycles a second or 32 kilohertz 32

---------11:56----------
thousand cycles a second maybe my fan is

---------11:59----------
spinning for 132 thousands of a second

---------12:03----------
so my thinking is corrosion is right on

---------12:05----------
top of a clock if the clock is not

---------12:07----------
turning on which means the computer is

---------12:08----------
literally going to turn on for 132

---------12:10----------
thousandths of a second or 125

---------12:12----------
millionths of a second which is quarter

---------12:15----------
fan spin it's actually not quarter fans

---------12:17----------
but it's 125 millionth of a fan spin and

---------12:20----------
when you replace this chip which is bad

---------12:22----------
which is most likely pulling the clock

---------12:24----------
signal down it fix my problem and again

---------12:27----------
you have to think this is not type of

---------12:29----------
problem where I look at the board and I

---------12:30----------
go yeah it's definitely a clock issue

---------12:33----------
because I don't want because if you

---------12:34----------
think that you're going to get really

---------12:35----------
really discouraged you're solving this

---------12:37----------
because you're going to think that I

---------12:38----------
literally look at a board with thousands

---------12:40----------
of components on it and go oh yeah of

---------12:42----------
course it's a clock issue because my

---------12:44----------
college degree says that no no it's not

---------12:46----------
that at all what I looked I analyzed and

---------12:50----------
then I saw something that looked funny

---------12:51----------
and then I apply my brains in that area

---------12:53----------
and then my then I look at this and then

---------12:56----------
in that area i see clock circuit then I

---------12:59----------
look at my problem again I think about

---------13:01----------
my problem again thinking is the key

---------13:03----------
here always be thinking I think and I

---------13:05----------
see whom so I'm having a problem with my

---------13:07----------
problems relate at a time the machine

---------13:09----------
turns on I don't know you know I don't

---------13:10----------
know it's turning on I don't know shorts

---------13:12----------
the ground but for some reason the PCH

---------13:14----------
and the CPU which are controlling all of

---------13:16----------
this the PCH and the CPU are not

---------13:17----------
keeping it on why is it not keeping it

---------13:20----------
on and the PCH and the CPU are

---------13:23----------
controlled by a clock and the clock is

---------13:25----------
is going at this really high frequency

---------13:27----------
so if that clock is not there what my

---------13:28----------
thinking is that things it's initiated

---------13:30----------
turn on and then it continued staying on

---------13:32----------
if the clock is good and my clock signal

---------13:35----------
is not there meaning that Mike machine

---------13:37----------
is again my time related issue is going

---------13:39----------
to be related to the one thing on this

---------13:41----------
board that had that is controlling time

---------13:45----------
and that thing that's controlling time

---------13:46----------
my problem is really to the time again

---------13:48----------
my problem is not that the fan doesn't

---------13:50----------
spend it's that it just bends for really

---------13:51----------
short period of time is right next to

---------13:53----------
the area that got corroded so am I going

---------13:55----------
to chase down my thunderbolt boost

---------13:56----------
circuit for external monitor or am I

---------13:58----------
going to look around a little area

---------13:59----------
before I come up with my yes definitely

---------14:01----------
gonna be chasing that no because like

---------14:03----------
why would I waste time on Thunderbolt

---------14:04----------
this doesn't even turn on why would

---------14:05----------
I care about Thunderbolt or display port

---------14:07----------
or any type of external imagery makes no

---------14:09----------
sense I want to do I'm going to look in

---------14:10----------
that area and see and again this is what

---------14:12----------
I want to get across to you because this

---------14:14----------
is about it's not about giving away

---------14:16----------
solutions it's about giving away a

---------14:18----------
mindset for troubleshooting that

---------14:19----------
empowers you because if you see that I

---------14:21----------
solved this issue by just just exploring

---------14:24----------
and then looking for what something

---------14:26----------
means and then applying that knowledge

---------14:27----------
once I have it it then it really seems

---------14:29----------
like something that you can do instead

---------14:31----------
of this seeming like this insurmountable

---------14:33----------
challenge that's impossible there

---------14:34----------
because if you think the requirement is

---------14:36----------
that you know everything it's going to

---------14:37----------
be really discouraging and you're not

---------14:38----------
going to think you could learn any of

---------14:39----------
this and you're not going to think that

---------14:40----------
you could move on you know the reason

---------14:43----------
that a lot of people are really really

---------14:44----------
good at figuring out problems and

---------14:46----------
they're good consultants but they make

---------14:47----------
horrible over the phone tech support is

---------14:48----------
that when you're in person when you're

---------14:50----------
sitting in front of a problem you can

---------14:51----------
kind of poke around and try to figure it

---------14:53----------
out the reason in / because you lose

---------14:57----------
that ability to poke around you lose

---------14:59----------
that ability to see oh the fan is dead

---------15:02----------
in the computer you lose the ability to

---------15:04----------
see that there's a light bulb blinking

---------15:06----------
on the same outlet as the computer you

---------15:08----------
lose the ability to look at your

---------15:09----------
surroundings in your environment and

---------15:10----------
really come to an informed decision you

---------15:12----------
need all your senses it's you need your

---------15:14----------
brain your eyes you just need to be

---------15:16----------
thinking really hard all the time to

---------15:18----------
solve this type of stuff because again

---------15:19----------
I'm not a genius I'm just looking and

---------15:22----------
I'm thinking and as long as I'm looking

---------15:24----------
and have my eyes open is what I'm

---------15:25----------
looking and thinking I'm gonna solve it
