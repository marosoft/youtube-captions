---------00:17----------
put your left summit on let's open this

---------00:25----------
thing up and see what's wrong with it

---------00:26----------
and see if we can fix it so what were

---------00:28----------
you gonna do is unplug the battery see

---------00:34----------
how much power this thing's using get

---------00:37----------
the multimeter power supply software up

---------00:40----------
on the screen plug it in plug it in plug

---------00:46----------
it in we're taking 40 milliamps no power

---------00:52----------
not 24 which is interesting cuz 24

---------00:54----------
milliamps is usually what happens when

---------00:56----------
p.m. sleep best for ELLs mr. Wilmer

---------00:58----------
can't find resistor where resistor y x

---------01:02----------
DP this is x DP something this doesn't

---------01:06----------
sound like it this goes to anything also

---------01:08----------
there's that actually that's not

---------01:09----------
corrosion that looks like conformal

---------01:11----------
coating uh-huh yes yes I found it what

---------01:16----------
are you you just want to say boomer a

---------01:19----------
lot don't you

---------01:20----------
you figured yeah yeah yeah okay

---------01:27----------
what is this thing what is this thing do

---------01:29----------
is going to be responsible for if all

---------01:37----------
says power good as present and p.m.

---------01:39----------
sleep as 3l is present which actually

---------01:40----------
needs to be present create us or else

---------01:42----------
that I believe a required to get also

---------01:43----------
power good to begin with then you get

---------01:45----------
CPU v CT power good but I don't think

---------01:49----------
we're there yet because if we're taking

---------01:51----------
40 milliamps we're not really in an Esso

---------01:53----------
state we're in an s4 state burn s5 state

---------01:56----------
however we're not taking that we're

---------01:59----------
taking 40 to 60 milliamps so maybe all

---------02:01----------
this chip needs is a little reflow

---------02:03----------
wouldn't that be something

---------02:05----------
oh my god Paul would kill me he's

---------02:08----------
watching this he's going to kill me if

---------02:12----------
Paul is at home he will kill me is he

---------02:19----------
if reef lowing this chip makes us work

---------02:21----------
again I am in for such a shitstorm when

---------02:23----------
he shows up tomorrow also what the hell

---------02:29----------
is that edge bonding it wasn't even

---------02:30----------
touching a chip

---------02:57----------
what's that which pen is that that's

---------03:01----------
corroded and that's corrode it is pen

---------03:05----------
six six gross

---------03:21----------
is there a reason you know he's

---------03:22----------
compressed there on the board to get all

---------03:23----------
the hair and dust off because then the

---------03:26----------
hair and dust goes into the air and

---------03:27----------
after it goes into the air it goes into

---------03:29----------
my body and after it goes to my body it

---------03:31----------
goes into my soul

---------03:44----------
hello Cindy hello Cindy how are you

---------03:53----------
doing this evening was not I would never

---------04:04----------
talk smack about you and

---------04:18----------
we're about to be shot

---------04:41----------
put your the left summers on Louis

---------04:48----------
congrats on the location my wife says my

---------04:51----------
wife says she loves it when you say pp

---------04:54----------
bus she is watching please say PP bus

---------05:06----------
pp bus

---------06:23----------
so it looks like the issue that we were

---------06:25----------
having this MacBook Air motherboard da20

---------06:26----------
dead zero zero one six five that goes

---------06:28----------
into the 2015/2016 a 14-6 13-inch

---------06:31----------
MacBook Air is that it was taking four

---------06:33----------
to 60 milliamps which means that most of

---------06:35----------
our S 5 and s 4 rails are likely present

---------06:37----------
but we're missing the S over else in the

---------06:38----------
issue that we're having here is that

---------06:39----------
even though p.m. sleeve s trail was

---------06:41----------
partially present and allowing the s or

---------06:42----------
s to turn on even though all says power

---------06:44----------
good was present meaning that most of

---------06:46----------
the sub rails were turning on it was not

---------06:48----------
sending out the signal called CPU VCT

---------06:50----------
power good which is going to allow the

---------06:52----------
rest of this isn't to turn on the CPU

---------06:53----------
power L doesn't turn on we're never

---------06:54----------
gonna get fans been we're never gonna

---------06:55----------
get the rest of the motion in the system

---------06:57----------
going and that was not turning on

---------06:59----------
because we had corrosion on new 1930

---------07:01----------
which could potentially show up people

---------07:02----------
in vol 5 so2 ground potentially short

---------07:04----------
pp5 es5 intermittently but also cause us

---------07:07----------
to have issues with PM sleep s3l as well

---------07:10----------
as with AUSA's power good if you short

---------07:11----------
all says power good or p.m. Slee best

---------07:13----------
three out of ground or you have

---------07:14----------
corrosion in that area then you're not

---------07:16----------
only are you not going to be getting

---------07:17----------
most of the Esso rails to work you're

---------07:19----------
also not going to get cpu v quarter work

---------07:20----------
which means you're not gonna get cpu VCC

---------07:22----------
st which means the CPU is not going to

---------07:23----------
turn on which means the CPUs not gonna

---------07:24----------
request the proper voltage and then it's

---------07:26----------
not gonna work

---------07:26----------
no I meant CPU is not gonna request the

---------07:29----------
power of proper voltage and then it's

---------07:30----------
not gonna work but now it does and we

---------07:34----------
have a fan spin

---------07:38----------
there's a very poor weapon grip I'll

---------07:41----------
have you know that I learned everything

---------07:43----------
on how to grip a weapon from watching

---------07:44----------
nerf videos on YouTube perfect accuracy

---------07:52----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------07:55----------
you learned something

---------07:57----------

---------08:10----------
stay
