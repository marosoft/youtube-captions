---------00:00----------
okay so today we're gonna start with an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero thirty seven eighty seven

---------00:03----------
board that's not turning on its can not

---------00:05----------
completely dead so if I plug in a

---------00:07----------
charger here you'll see that I can get a

---------00:10----------
green and then an orange light on it

---------00:12----------
however the fan doesn't spin it never

---------00:14----------
turns on so let's try and figure out why

---------00:16----------
that is so the first thing that we would

---------00:18----------
usually do in this situation

---------00:19----------
is check out to see if there is any

---------00:22----------
powell rails missing anytime you have a

---------00:23----------
no power situation it's a safe

---------00:25----------
assumption that a power rail that you

---------00:26----------
would need is missing and that's why

---------00:28----------
you're not getting power so first things

---------00:30----------
first I'm going to open up the schematic

---------00:33----------
and board view software over here so

---------00:35----------
that you can see everything so let's

---------00:37----------
just get to the proper page where you

---------00:39----------
can see that stuff okay so well f4 and

---------00:47----------
you should be able to see the schematic

---------00:48----------
in the board view now so let's scroll

---------00:51----------
down a little bit

---------00:52----------
now the most important page for me on

---------00:54----------
this schematic is the page that lists

---------00:56----------
every single power rail one by one so I

---------00:59----------
don't know where it is on this schematic

---------01:01----------
they used to have it on pages like right

---------01:03----------
in the beginning around page five six

---------01:05----------
and seven and these two have a diagram

---------01:07----------
on pages one and two and now I have no

---------01:09----------
idea where the hell they put any of this

---------01:11----------


---------01:11----------
let's see so that's open thirty seven

---------01:18----------
eighty seven here we go

---------01:19----------
so let's see what page are we looking

---------01:23----------
for here

---------01:32----------
yep only Apple so when it comes to

---------01:35----------
things that are important like power

---------01:37----------
rails most most manufacturers will put

---------01:39----------
that on the first page because it's the

---------01:41----------
most important thing when you're dealing

---------01:43----------
with an Apple schematic it'll be on page

---------01:45----------
81 out of 94 that's that's a nice middle

---------01:49----------
finger if I've ever seen one

---------01:50----------
so the first power rail here is pp bus

---------01:52----------
g3 hot and the schematic says that

---------01:54----------
that's supposed to be twelve point eight

---------01:56----------
volts so I'm gonna use the board view

---------01:58----------
software I'm just gonna type in pp bus

---------01:59----------
underscore g3 hot and it's gonna show me

---------02:01----------
everywhere that pp bus g3 hot shows up

---------02:03----------
on the board I'm gonna arrange the board

---------02:06----------
view software so that it's in the same

---------02:07----------
orientation that I have the board in the

---------02:09----------
table somehow the board view software

---------02:11----------
always knows how to open itself up so

---------02:13----------
that it's in a different orientation

---------02:14----------
than it is on the table so I'm gonna

---------02:17----------
plug in the MagSafe and we're just going

---------02:19----------
to take the multimeter and let's see

---------02:21----------
what voltage I get so at that point we

---------02:27----------
put this into voltage mode now there's

---------02:29----------
gonna be two voltage modes and your

---------02:30----------
multimeter one is gonna usually have a

---------02:31----------
little wavy line that's for AC and the

---------02:33----------
other one is going to have a straight

---------02:34----------
line that's for DC we're looking at

---------02:37----------
measuring DC voltage here all these

---------02:38----------
voltages are supposed to be DC so set

---------02:41----------
your multimeter to measure DC voltage

---------02:42----------
take the black probe here I'm gonna put

---------02:45----------
it on ground which is gonna be a screw

---------02:46----------
hole or any one of these large metal

---------02:49----------
connecting or looking things on the

---------02:50----------
board so I usually use a screw hole and

---------02:52----------
then we're gonna take the red probe and

---------02:54----------
put it where the board view said ppbut

---------02:57----------
g3 hot is supposed to show up and I get

---------02:59----------
four point zero eight volts now in the

---------03:01----------
schematic it's systems were supposed to

---------03:02----------
get twelve point eight volts so the

---------03:04----------
first thing I'm gonna want to do here is

---------03:05----------
try and figure out why it is I don't

---------03:07----------
have the voltage that I'm supposed to so

---------03:09----------
let's move over to the chip that's

---------03:10----------
responsible for it which is you 7100

---------03:13----------
which is actually it's not used I'm in

---------03:15----------
the wrong schematic aren't I

---------03:16----------
I am in the wrong schematic right now I

---------03:19----------
think I have to Sumatra windows open and

---------03:21----------
it's kind of screwing with me

---------03:22----------
I do don't I okay here we go so let's go

---------03:26----------
over to you seventy one hundred which is

---------03:30----------
usually the first thing that I check in

---------03:32----------
no power cases around this area so

---------03:33----------
useless let's take a look at this under

---------03:36----------
the microscope so I'm going to use the

---------03:38----------
board view software to show me where you

---------03:40----------
70 100 is it is at c4 components and

---------03:43----------
it'll show

---------03:44----------
it'll open a window that allows you to

---------03:46----------
type in the name of a component and then

---------03:48----------
it will show you where it is on the

---------03:49----------
board of course it's gonna show you

---------03:50----------
where it is on the board and the

---------03:52----------
opposite relation that the board is on

---------03:53----------
the desk it always knows exactly what

---------03:56----------
way I have the board in the desk so that

---------03:57----------
it can open it in the opposite way and

---------03:59----------
this is you 7100 so let's take a look in

---------04:02----------
that area and we're also gonna look in

---------04:03----------
the schematic and see if you have any

---------04:04----------
idea what's going on now if you look at

---------04:07----------
it under the microscope which I should

---------04:08----------
probably plug in before I say let's look

---------04:10----------
at it under the microscope you uh let's

---------04:13----------
wait a second for that to turn on yeah

---------04:16----------
come on good little microscope there we

---------04:19----------
go

---------04:20----------
alright so let's look at that area and

---------04:22----------
see if anything looks particularly funny

---------04:24----------
now does anything look bad here to you

---------04:26----------
this is one of those cave area those

---------04:28----------
cases where if it looks bad it as bad is

---------04:31----------
actually a something that you can use so

---------04:35----------
yeah come on I'll give you guys a second

---------04:37----------
to tell me if anything looks bad there

---------04:38----------
this is not our usual liquid damage case

---------04:41----------
there's no liquid damage of this machine

---------04:43----------
but there's something else didn't get it

---------04:48----------
yet still not okay

---------04:53----------
I'll show you let's get my tweezers

---------05:00----------
see this with a little hole in the

---------05:02----------
middle of it

---------05:03----------
that's no good so let's just zoom in a

---------05:05----------
little more because I know you may be

---------05:06----------
saying what do you mean a hole in it I

---------05:07----------
can't tell with YouTube compression what

---------05:09----------
the hell that is all right so let's zoom

---------05:12----------
in a little more so that you can see

---------05:13----------
what I'm talking about

---------05:26----------
now on the Left resistor it's a little

---------05:29----------
less pronounced than it is on the right

---------05:30----------
resistor on the Left resistor it looks

---------05:32----------
like a little bit of brown in the center

---------05:33----------
of the resistor and a tiny protrusion

---------05:35----------
but on the right resistor it's a very

---------05:37----------
clearly pronounced black dot and that

---------05:39----------
clearly pronounced black dot is where

---------05:41----------
the resistor itself blew up so when

---------05:43----------
resistors die resistors don't usually

---------05:45----------
die where they go from being let's say

---------05:47----------
10 ohms to being zero ohms they don't

---------05:49----------
die where they turn into a wire they die

---------05:51----------
in the opposite way that lets say a

---------05:52----------
capacitor usually dies on these in these

---------05:54----------
boards where the resistor turns into

---------05:56----------
just a pile of mush so it usually fails

---------05:59----------
open where it doesn't pass any

---------06:02----------
electricity at all so let's just go over

---------06:04----------
what that is for in the schematic here

---------06:06----------
and show you what that circuit does so

---------06:14----------
this is our 7021 in our 7022 this is

---------06:18----------
part of a current sensing circuit that

---------06:20----------
uses the shunt resistor our 7120 to go

---------06:22----------
to the il-62 v 9 in order to tell the

---------06:25----------
Machine how much amperage that buck

---------06:27----------
converter is using so this here this u

---------06:29----------
7100 circuit is a buck converter if you

---------06:31----------
don't know what a buck converter is

---------06:32----------
watch the buck converter series videos

---------06:34----------
that I've done that explain exactly what

---------06:36----------
a buck converter is so long story short

---------06:38----------
this takes the 16 to 18 volts from your

---------06:41----------
charger and turns it into 12 point 8

---------06:43----------
volts for the machine a run off of and

---------06:45----------
that's what this entire thing does so it

---------06:47----------
pretty much switches back and forth back

---------06:48----------
and forth between 16 0 16 0 in ordered

---------06:51----------
its average it out to 12 to get you to

---------06:53----------
12 volts now the computer is going to

---------06:55----------
want to know how much current this

---------06:57----------
circuit is using let's say there's a

---------06:58----------
short circuit inside your machine let's

---------07:00----------
say something bad happens or liquid gets

---------07:02----------
spilled on it the machine is not going

---------07:04----------
to

---------07:05----------
I'll tell the charger to stay on because

---------07:07----------
if you have to charge or stay on when

---------07:09----------
there's a short circuit to ground or

---------07:10----------
there's liquid spill the charger may

---------07:12----------
blow up or to get destroyed or something

---------07:14----------
terrible may happen so there's something

---------07:15----------
called current sensing going on here and

---------07:17----------
what it does is it tries to tell how

---------07:19----------
much current the system is using now

---------07:21----------
this is usually not a noticeable voltage

---------07:24----------
drop across the resistor it's not like

---------07:25----------
you have 12 volts on one side and 1 volt

---------07:27----------
in the other but across this resistor

---------07:29----------
there's going to be a really really

---------07:31----------
really really really tiny voltage drop

---------07:33----------
and the ISL 6259 is going to measure the

---------07:37----------
difference in voltage between the top of

---------07:38----------
this resistor and the

---------07:40----------
this resistor however the ISL 65:9 here

---------07:42----------
does not have a direct path to the top

---------07:44----------
and the bottom of this resistor what it

---------07:46----------
has is these two resistors in between so

---------07:49----------
that you know if anything gets goes

---------07:51----------
wrong in the current sensing area

---------07:52----------
instead of blowing up the is all six two

---------07:54----------
five nine which costs you no more money

---------07:56----------
than let's say a resistor it just blows

---------07:58----------
up these two stupid little resistors

---------07:59----------
instead of destroying your entire system

---------08:01----------
which is a good thing because this chip

---------08:03----------
connects directly to the SMC it connects

---------08:05----------
directly to several other things so you

---------08:06----------
don't want 16 volts potentially going to

---------08:08----------
your SMC with a surge just because the

---------08:11----------
current sensing circuitry decided to go

---------08:13----------
poof or do something silly so you have

---------08:15----------
these resistors in between now there's

---------08:18----------
gonna be a small voltage drop across our

---------08:20----------
7120 now that voltage drop is going to

---------08:23----------
be proportional to how much current or

---------08:24----------
amperage the system is using and this is

---------08:26----------
how the use 70 100 is able to report to

---------08:28----------
the SMC how much how many amps the

---------08:30----------
charger is using you'll also see we have

---------08:32----------
a current sensing circuit over here it's

---------08:34----------
the exact same thing except over here

---------08:35----------
it's for the battery and these two

---------08:38----------
resistors went poof now one great way to

---------08:40----------
figure out if this entire if anything in

---------08:43----------
the circuit is wrong instead of having

---------08:44----------
to see is the eye path from the is all

---------08:47----------
to the resistor good is the path from

---------08:48----------
the root this resistor to the shunt

---------08:49----------
resistor good is this resistor good is

---------08:51----------
the path from the shunt resistor are

---------08:52----------
7021 good and is the path from our 7021

---------08:55----------
to this good what you can do to measure

---------08:57----------
the entire circuit in one measurement is

---------08:59----------
measure the resistance between pins 27

---------09:02----------
and 28 because if you measure the

---------09:03----------
resistance between these two pins and

---------09:04----------
everything is working the number that

---------09:06----------
you should get should be this a the

---------09:10----------
series addition of the sum I'm being an

---------09:13----------
idiot series edition where the did

---------09:15----------
I get that from the sum of all the

---------09:18----------
resistors in the circuit so our 7022 is

---------09:20----------
10 ohms our 7020 is 0.02 ohms in our

---------09:24----------
7021 is 10 ohms so you should get twenty

---------09:27----------
point zero two ohms if you measure bits

---------09:29----------
you inch 20 pins 27 and 28 and when I

---------09:32----------
measure between between twins between

---------09:35----------
between twins well that's that kind of

---------09:40----------
sounds like the name of a porno between

---------09:42----------
twins when I measure between pins 27 and

---------09:46----------
28

---------09:47----------
I get four point 64 million ohms which

---------09:50----------
is very far off from the twenty point

---------09:51----------
zero two that I'm supposed to get so

---------09:53----------
most likely those two

---------09:54----------
sisters are bad and they have to go and

---------09:56----------
when they do go there's a very good

---------09:57----------
chance that this will actually work so

---------09:59----------
let's get started

---------10:00----------
turn on the hot air turn on the air

---------10:04----------
filter and off they go

---------10:20----------
well these are standard people tweezers

---------10:23----------
by the way these are not the regular

---------10:24----------
ones I use look it out unfit they seem

---------10:27----------
for this job I mean

---------10:36----------
like asking an elephant to sign his name

---------10:39----------
with a fine point pen

---------11:16----------
yeah there was a little bit of dirt in

---------11:18----------
there

---------11:27----------
clean that out okay now let's grab two

---------11:31----------
more 10 ohm resistors

---------11:49----------
they come prepare it I have a spool of

---------11:51----------
them

---------12:06----------
these trees are awful oh and they get

---------12:11----------
magnetized super easy seriously this is

---------12:18----------
dog

---------12:21----------
I really should just get up and get my

---------12:23----------
other tweezers I don't know why are

---------12:24----------
these came from you

---------12:43----------
okay let's just do this one at a time

---------13:06----------
if this video does anything it denotes

---------13:08----------
the importance of using good tweezers

---------13:11----------
let's get good tweezers right now let's

---------13:13----------
try to do that same job except now with

---------13:15----------
a proper tool this actually is this is

---------13:20----------
the proper tool but it's a broken

---------13:21----------
version of it these traces are really

---------13:22----------
messed up but you'll see how much easier

---------13:24----------
everything is when you just have the

---------13:26----------
proper tool see nothing it's way too

---------13:32----------
much flux I do that so I can get trolled

---------13:36----------
by eevblog people I'm just gonna start

---------13:41----------
adding flux to everything I'm gonna

---------13:43----------
start a cooking channel and have Amtech

---------13:46----------
5:59 on everything see good tool it's

---------13:54----------
like spam thank you

---------14:03----------
by the way if you're wondering what

---------14:04----------
caused this 99% chance this was a

---------14:08----------
knockoff charger now what a lot of

---------14:15----------
people do also that I want to point out

---------14:16----------
here that's wrong

---------14:18----------
they put place the resistor and then

---------14:20----------
they try the hot air it I don't know

---------14:23----------
what it is but so many people have

---------14:24----------
something against simply holding the

---------14:27----------
resistor in place like I just did that

---------14:28----------
and I got it right in the pads but that

---------14:32----------
doesn't always happen most of the time

---------14:34----------
in these videos you'll see that I'm what

---------14:37----------
I do is I hold the resistor while I'm

---------14:41----------
putting it down this way I can ensure

---------14:44----------
that it doesn't move okay everything

---------14:47----------
there looks like it's back in place I

---------14:49----------
can put my 10 ohm resistor spool away

---------14:53----------
I'm sad that I lost one but that's what

---------14:55----------
I get for being lazy

---------15:02----------
kick off all the noisy stuff

---------15:19----------
still dead ha all right now we continue

---------15:25----------
let's see what we get

---------15:27----------
so PP buzz g3 hot is three point nine

---------15:37----------
six seven hmm

---------15:39----------
did I really fix my current sensing

---------15:41----------
circuit let's go back to resistance mode

---------15:44----------
measurements here I'm gonna measure the

---------15:46----------
resistance between pins 27 and 28 which

---------15:48----------
were for the current sensing circuit and

---------15:51----------
let's see I should ideally I should have

---------15:52----------
twenty point zero two and I have four

---------15:57----------
point 65 ohms again huh let's see I put

---------16:00----------
in a 10 ohm resistor and that 10 ohm

---------16:04----------
resistor is readings 4.52 kilo ohms

---------16:06----------
great I put in a 10 ohm resistor that

---------16:11----------
resistor is reading 143 ohms

---------16:20----------
WTF let's try this again

---------16:25----------
let's see what 1/16 of a watt is what I

---------16:30----------
have my resistors at and the schematic

---------16:32----------
says that those are supposed to be 1/16

---------16:35----------
of a watt 5% 5% tolerance so so what the

---------16:40----------
 is something else killing it that's

---------16:44----------
always possible that something else is

---------16:46----------
killing it alright so I tried to do the

---------16:52----------
quote unquote correct thing and take the

---------16:54----------
resistors out of a new spool now I'm

---------16:56----------
going to do the incorrect thing and make

---------16:59----------
make the trolls angry and just take the

---------17:02----------
resistor off of I'm just gonna take the

---------17:06----------
resistors off of a donor board see what

---------17:08----------
happens here fine

---------17:10----------
 it

---------17:14----------
and this time gonna measure the

---------17:16----------
resistance before I turn it on and after

---------17:19----------
I turn it on we'll see what's causing

---------17:23----------
this

---------17:58----------
that's a nice certified preowned

---------18:00----------
resistor

---------18:07----------
another certified preowned resistor I in

---------18:13----------
ceará

---------18:18----------
flow it in a place

---------18:23----------
okay now this time I'm gonna measure the

---------18:26----------
impedance or resistance before and after

---------18:31----------
so before I turn it on 10 ohms good

---------18:39----------
stuff the other one 10 ohms good stuff

---------18:45----------
okay now I'm gonna plug the charger in

---------18:49----------
and I'm gonna look under the microscope

---------18:50----------
at those resistors while I'm plugging

---------18:53----------
the charger in see if anything funny

---------18:56----------
happens here and your funny business

---------18:59----------
happening here

---------19:07----------
I don't see anything blow up

---------19:14----------
I also don't see anything turning on

---------19:17----------
well let's see

---------19:19----------
pp bus g3 hard at this point is

---------19:30----------
4.02

---------19:41----------
resistance of my resistors is 316 oh

---------19:50----------
okay okay and 1.5 million kilohms so now

---------19:58----------
I'm gonna do is I'm going to measure for

---------19:59----------
a short to ground anywhere around that

---------20:01----------
area to see if that's what's killing me

---------20:03----------
and of course this is interesting so on

---------20:10----------
this side let's do this in split view so

---------20:12----------
you can see what the I'm talking

---------20:14----------
about

---------20:14----------
alright so check this out so this on the

---------20:18----------
top that's where it's coming from the

---------20:19----------
shunt resistor on the bottom of each

---------20:20----------
resistor that's where it's going to the

---------20:21----------
chip so over here I have undyed more

---------20:25----------
0.48 one which is not a short two

---------20:28----------
grounds at all and on this side over

---------20:30----------
here

---------20:31----------
I have zero point zero one three which

---------20:34----------
in the context of this circuit is a

---------20:36----------
short to ground so let's take a look

---------20:39----------
here we're going to take the hot air and

---------20:42----------
what if I this capacitor over here is

---------20:44----------
actually going to ground so what if this

---------20:46----------
capacitor here is what's bad and it

---------20:48----------
wasn't that the resistors were bad but

---------20:49----------
rather that this capacitor is actually

---------20:51----------
killing my current sensing circuit

---------20:52----------
because one of the things you may notice

---------20:53----------
there's actually on each one of these

---------20:55----------
current sensing lines there is a

---------20:57----------
capacitor going to ground now it could

---------21:01----------
be something different it could be that

---------21:03----------
the ISL itself is bad or it could be

---------21:05----------
that this capacitor is bad but there's

---------21:06----------
only one way to figure that out

---------21:07----------
so let's disconnect the capacitor and

---------21:09----------
see if that's bad if that's going to

---------21:12----------
ground so I do this and I do this and I

---------21:17----------
still have a zero point zero one three

---------21:18----------
measurement which means and let me just

---------21:20----------
show you where that is on the schematic

---------21:22----------
it's time to actually put this in a

---------21:23----------
context so right over here so they just

---------21:26----------
make sure I'm in the right space are

---------21:29----------
7021 right over here

---------21:30----------
alright this end of the resistor there

---------21:33----------
is a short circuit to ground now there

---------21:35----------
are two ways that this could be shorted

---------21:36----------
to ground it could be shorted to ground

---------21:37----------
by sea 7121 which I just removed which

---------21:40----------
did not remove the short or the u7 7100

---------21:43----------
this could have failed and also shorted

---------21:44----------
to ground so the use 7100 is what failed

---------21:47----------
because when I remove the capacitor we

---------21:48----------
still have the same exact trait so now

---------21:50----------
we have to replace you 7,000 and I also

---------21:52----------
have to you seventy 100

---------21:54----------
I have to replace the buck converter I

---------21:55----------
see but then we also have to replace the

---------21:57----------
damn current sensing resistors again

---------21:59----------
because I'm an idiot who didn't realize

---------22:00----------
that the first time around

---------22:02----------
great alright so this is the third time

---------22:07----------
that I'm gonna be replacing the same

---------22:08----------
thing because I was being an idiot

---------22:22----------
so first things first is to put that

---------22:24----------
capacitor back on because that capacitor

---------22:26----------
did nothing wrong

---------22:41----------
and now is to remove the current sensing

---------22:44----------
resistors which we have to replace and

---------22:46----------
also of course the ISL 6259 which was

---------22:49----------
the culprit all along

---------23:00----------
there's no space in this desk I tried to

---------23:03----------
move the board up so you can see it

---------23:04----------
better in the microscope camera and I do

---------23:07----------
that and they hit the damn keyboard move

---------23:10----------
the keyboard up in the keyboard it's the

---------23:11----------
television New York is great you don't

---------23:14----------
have space for here

---------23:40----------
that's me soldering like an ape

---------23:42----------
recording to shock on eevblog I kind of

---------23:45----------
enjoy soldering like an ape though it's

---------23:48----------
like my I should make that my logo like

---------23:52----------
instead of a sheep I should also have an

---------23:54----------
ape logo me an ape next to it so why I

---------24:00----------
don't really post on forums like a lot

---------24:01----------
of people have suggested that I post on

---------24:03----------
these online forums and it's like what

---------24:04----------
why would I bother really

---------24:07----------
what the would I go out of my way

---------24:09----------
to do that it's mostly just a bunch of

---------24:14----------
truth it's kind of like the same reason

---------24:16----------
that I'm not really you know the most

---------24:18----------
sociable person you know meeting new

---------24:22----------
people sucks just a bunch of people that

---------24:26----------
are gonna go out of their way to insult

---------24:30----------
people they don't even know it like

---------24:38----------
other things I say on this channel about

---------24:39----------
people but they're usually people that I

---------24:41----------
know are people who have personally

---------24:42----------
caused me loss of money loss of time or

---------24:45----------
it's gone out of their way to make my

---------24:47----------
life difficult but like and I'm sure

---------24:50----------
that that's gonna get more widespread

---------24:54----------
the more subscribers that I get it's

---------24:56----------
like a lot of that crap that I read

---------24:57----------
online it's like there's like a lot of

---------24:59----------
hate when I had like 4000 subscribers

---------25:02----------
even back then I really didn't care

---------25:04----------
about joining forums and talking to

---------25:06----------
people very much honest about this stuff

---------25:08----------
it's just so much snark and who needs it

---------25:14----------
okay I'd rather stay here in my my

---------25:19----------
jungle and be an ape kind of like being

---------25:23----------
an ape

---------25:26----------
eat my banana play my Donkey Kong

---------26:02----------
hello

---------26:08----------
hello

---------26:12----------
hello

---------26:15----------
what's up that was it how's it going

---------26:22----------
Sean tired what can I do for you two

---------26:50----------
fine scrambled for me does it I would I

---------27:06----------
would

---------27:07----------
cake if you run GPU test does it for the

---------27:10----------
desert crash is it it was a dropped was

---------27:15----------
the liquid damaged or was it something

---------27:17----------
random make make them do it again and

---------27:29----------
demand and demand a 2015 retina for all

---------27:32----------
of her troubles I mean it's mostly that

---------27:38----------
I would just charge you can charge them

---------27:41----------
to back up their data or you could just

---------27:42----------
take the SSD out and just ask for a tip

---------27:44----------
and be nice but either that that machine

---------27:47----------
is just gonna be a [ __ ] if you

---------27:48----------
actually try to fix it for the ladies so

---------27:50----------
what I would do is I would just tell

---------27:52----------
them - I can take the SSD out for you

---------27:54----------
and put it in a little bag and you can

---------27:56----------
take this to Apple and just have them

---------27:58----------
replace the board for again it could be

---------28:01----------
the screen it could be the MUX which is

---------28:03----------
what switches between internal graphics

---------28:04----------
and next internal graphics and the GPU

---------28:07----------
because there are different pathways for

---------28:09----------
the ground I think there's different

---------28:10----------
pathways in that machine for the

---------28:11----------
graphics to get to the external monitor

---------28:13----------
versus the regular so it I'm pretty sure

---------28:16----------
it's the graphics chip though just from

---------28:18----------
what you've described and she just

---------28:19----------
probably got another shitty board from

---------28:20----------
Apple

---------28:30----------
what you should do because the thing is

---------28:32----------
Apple is very likely to do that and pull

---------28:34----------
some so what I would do is I

---------28:36----------
would tell tell the customer to tell

---------28:38----------
Apple the last time I went here they

---------28:40----------
took the SSD out of the computer and put

---------28:42----------
it in a bag for me so what you're gonna

---------28:43----------
do is tell her to tell the Genius Bar

---------28:45----------
clerk that the last time I was here

---------28:47----------
about this issue they said that they

---------28:49----------
could take my SSD out and that they did

---------28:51----------
it because that that works

---------28:54----------
I've used that on people before and that

---------28:55----------
works they they because they come back

---------28:56----------
and they tell me yeah work thank you or

---------28:59----------
otherwise they're just going to wipe her

---------29:00----------
data and be pricks for no reason

---------29:12----------
I was happy to see that you fixed the

---------29:14----------
one with the keyboard issue after the

---------29:16----------
class that was funny you called in the

---------29:42----------
middle of a YouTube video so you're

---------29:43----------
actually gonna what this phone call is

---------29:44----------
gonna wind up being in a YouTube video

---------29:46----------
so if this vid if this board works and

---------29:48----------
doesn't go on fire this will actually

---------29:49----------
serve as my advertising Thank You Sean

---------30:00----------
see you later

---------30:02----------
and just as he says that the board

---------30:05----------
actually works see Sean calling was my

---------30:06----------
good luck charm he was a he was a

---------30:08----------
student that came to the class and he

---------30:10----------
also came to my personal tutoring here

---------30:12----------
for for a week he went from not fixing

---------30:15----------
back light fuses on this stuff to -

---------30:19----------
fixing like quarter fan spin and like

---------30:22----------
LVDS MUX issues and no keyboard because

---------30:25----------
I had to run jumper wires all over the

---------30:27----------
board and it's pretty cool I like like

---------30:28----------
the thing I like about Sean is he's one

---------30:30----------
of those people that is down-to-earth

---------30:32----------
honest and humble so even if he knows

---------30:34----------
something or he knows something that you

---------30:35----------
don't know he's not gonna act like an

---------30:36----------
[ __ ] about it he's always a downer

---------30:38----------
'the humble really nice guy like you

---------30:40----------
know not like most of the [ __ ] that

---------30:42----------
I meet in New York but you know I'm

---------30:44----------
really happy when I see people like that

---------30:46----------
that are successful like again I still

---------30:48----------
remember there was this one dude that

---------30:49----------
came here and he said you know I've just

---------30:52----------
been working at a recycling company for

---------30:53----------
a really short period of time before

---------30:55----------
that I was a pizza store clerk and I

---------30:57----------
worked at a pizza store and hehe and

---------31:00----------
there was another person that I had here

---------31:02----------
at the same time and he was really it

---------31:04----------
was particularly insecure person and

---------31:06----------
he's asking about you know the

---------31:07----------
backgrounds of all the people coming and

---------31:08----------
he's like pizza store well how was he

---------31:10----------
gonna expect to learn this when he came

---------31:12----------
here from a pizza store well the first

---------31:14----------
guy at the pizza store dude fixed over

---------31:16----------
21 boards within less than a month of

---------31:18----------
going back home it was company and the

---------31:20----------
guy he was making fun of the pizza store

---------31:22----------
guy has

---------31:23----------
it's not fixed over 20 boards so you

---------31:27----------
know it's just one of those things where

---------31:28----------
you know I really like seeing humble

---------31:30----------
people become successful you know it's

---------31:33----------
just you know cherry on top when it's

---------31:36----------
because of my teaching but yeah check it

---------31:39----------
out so we had a current sensing issue

---------31:40----------
and the current sensing issue with the

---------31:42----------
current sensing circuit went dead went

---------31:44----------
dead after the current section current

---------31:47----------
sensing section of the ISL 6259 which is

---------31:50----------
the buck converter chip over here doe I

---------31:54----------
just closed the window by doing that

---------31:56----------
when dead so went dead was the current

---------32:00----------
sensing section of you 7100 it shorted

---------32:02----------
to ground right on this pin and on CSI P

---------32:06----------
and when that happened it would kill

---------32:08----------
this resistor because you pretty much be

---------32:10----------
sending the 16 volts from the discharger

---------32:13----------
the 16 volts coming to the charge would

---------32:14----------
pretty much get shorted to ground at

---------32:15----------
this particular point and this it's

---------32:18----------
actually good again if this resistor

---------32:20----------
wasn't there you'd be shorting the

---------32:21----------
charger to ground and destroying a lot

---------32:23----------
more stuff so it's good that our 7121 is

---------32:25----------
there it's good that our 7121 kept it

---------32:27----------
from dying and it's good that this works

---------32:28----------
because it means I get to give it back

---------32:30----------
to my customer and yeah that's pretty

---------32:33----------
cool
