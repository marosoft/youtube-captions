---------00:00----------
stop what did you bring let's see that's

---------00:07----------
a tip that's Oh see that's this should

---------00:13----------
be fun hello yeah clip this on okay my

---------00:44----------
board is done that's well man thank you

---------00:54----------
a point seems you point the thingy up

---------00:58----------
this is a cheap piece of crap hey I got

---------01:02----------
what I paid for

---------01:04----------
that should work

---------01:06----------
alright so who are you I am Ross from

---------01:09----------
your break I fix me lux oh all right so

---------01:12----------
what do we have here

---------01:13----------
so I had a customer accurately say there

---------01:16----------
a lady driver or back my driver burnt

---------01:20----------
out and they had no backlight and I took

---------01:24----------
it in just a diagonal like a picture cuz

---------01:27----------
I obviously didn't have the video feed

---------01:28----------
and surprisingly they were very accurate

---------01:32----------
oh very rare very rare and that is

---------01:34----------
actually on the entire motherboard the

---------01:36----------
only area that has corrosion on it there

---------01:38----------
was no other signs of liquid damage so

---------01:40----------
giving that that was the case I did try

---------01:43----------
to remove it now the problem is this

---------01:45----------
this pad is gone it's ultra hard and

---------01:51----------
burnt away would show me where yeah oh

---------01:58----------
what's that thing for

---------02:00----------
that is why I'm here

---------02:04----------
I'm watching the stream to avoid the

---------02:06----------
mental war of refer being 130 Dell

---------02:08----------
desktops that sounds painful but I was

---------02:12----------
looking as we're talking I saw that this

---------02:14----------
went through a pretty shirt if I read

---------02:16----------
the schematic right that it does run

---------02:18----------
through P P 3 B 3 so let's see what is

---------02:21----------
that thing for open why so much okay

---------02:32----------
just get them all TV ok so you're

---------02:40----------
missing this PP 3 V 3 s oh yeah which

---------02:43----------
goes to the middle huh

---------02:46----------
how that could go so it was pretty bad

---------02:52----------
because this is it being removed and you

---------02:55----------
can see if that's where it is and the

---------02:56----------
resistor that's right here is Oh fine

---------02:58----------
but that one was just ultra destroyed

---------03:00----------
now the key was what we were talking

---------03:03----------
about with the enamel wire the first

---------03:05----------
question is do you need it yeah that was

---------03:09----------
the main question so I just jumped to

---------03:11----------
doing it and realized okay so good let's

---------03:14----------
so this is C 7/7/11 C 7/7/11 so that is

---------03:25----------
a capacitor between PP 3 v 3 SL on

---------03:28----------
ground probably for smoothing that's

---------03:30----------
brooch may not be needed so the real

---------03:32----------
question is whether or not the PP 3 V 3

---------03:35----------
s o is already here

---------03:37----------
or if it needs to travel from here to

---------03:39----------
that ball up there goes on the board

---------03:41----------
view it says that this is pp 3 V 3 SL so

---------03:43----------
the first thing I would do is measure to

---------03:44----------
see if that's actually already there

---------03:46----------
because if it is all you need to do is

---------03:48----------
put an LED driver yeah so let's now this

---------03:53----------
should be able to turn on without an LED

---------03:55----------
driver I just got to find a DC n board

---------03:56----------
somewhere so we'll get a DC n board and

---------03:59----------
come right back yeah you read this and

---------04:03----------
try to find comments that are not truly

---------04:33----------
this is what you get to deal with all

---------04:36----------
day right pretty much

---------04:38----------
hey man I got a say in this

---------04:43----------
okay a long time coming so let's plug

---------04:49----------
this in yeah you might actually be a fan

---------04:53----------
of us now man I switched over to

---------04:54----------
Samsung's but you got the shirt never

---------04:57----------
yeah they uh they forced us to wear it

---------04:59----------
that's there is actually a lot of emails

---------05:03----------
and make sure you wear your Samsung

---------05:04----------
shirts which I thought to be a little

---------05:06----------
entertaining okay so plug in all right

---------05:13----------
so my first question is does 3.40 those

---------05:17----------
3.3 volts show up at that point without

---------05:21----------
that with that pad missing so it's in

---------05:25----------
the middle which is here yeah GEMA

---------05:35----------
interesting oh that's painful very close

---------05:44----------
to this chat window Jesus Christ

---------05:47----------
there's nothing ain't good in there and

---------05:51----------
I so the five waiter

---------05:55----------
yeah meter five volts where five volts

---------05:58----------
is supposed to be but no three volts or

---------06:00----------
three volts is supposed to be so let's

---------06:02----------
sit first yeah let's see if there's any

---------06:04----------
any thick there could be dirt under the

---------06:07----------
solder so we let's dig a little maybe I

---------06:10----------
wouldn't doubt it I was undesirably

---------06:13----------
thinking it might be a smart decision to

---------06:15----------
take solder paste and

---------06:19----------
you know just custom make my own balls

---------06:21----------
that were very uneven and inaccurate I

---------06:23----------
figured that would be the best method

---------06:25----------
I'm like I'm not quite convinced that

---------06:27----------
3.3 volts hops from that capacitor pad

---------06:29----------
to the underneath the this to underneath

---------06:34----------
the IC

---------06:41----------
hugs and kisses to you 2x gilmore hugs

---------06:45----------
and kisses to you too okay so first

---------06:50----------
thing to do is clean it and then turn it

---------06:55----------
back on its Eve 3.3 volt shows up so 3.3

---------07:04----------
volts is supposed to show up over here

---------07:06----------
or obviously it won't and over here for

---------07:09----------
those of you following along at home

---------07:10----------
let me get 0.07 that sucks so yeah so

---------07:17----------
right now there are two things we can do

---------07:20----------
we can either steal this voltage from

---------07:22----------
somewhere else in the board so we have

---------07:24----------
3.3 volts s Oh so we can steal this from

---------07:27----------
any one of these many points but it may

---------07:29----------
require running and jump run to the

---------07:31----------
board and that sucks the second thing

---------07:33----------
that we can do try to kind of follow

---------07:34----------
where this came from so it comes from

---------07:39----------
this and then goes into there so let's

---------07:43----------
see if we can do a little scrapey

---------07:45----------
scrapey and then fine and see if P P 3ds

---------07:49----------
3 s o is over here

---------08:00----------
[Music]

---------08:02----------
yeah so a little bit of stabbing a

---------08:04----------
little bit of scraping and

---------08:15----------
okay now

---------08:18----------
let's see if there's a nub left that we

---------08:20----------
can use maybe able to dig and find a nub

---------08:24----------
and then you can put a little saddle

---------08:26----------
ball on top of the nub and melt it on

---------08:29----------
there and then make a new pad

---------08:31----------
unless it's totally ripped off why don't

---------08:35----------
you scratch this trace to the left well

---------08:36----------
we've done that but now we have to

---------08:37----------
attach it to the nub and the board that

---------08:38----------
it was originally attached to but good

---------08:40----------
thinking on sasses part whose name I'm

---------08:42----------
probably miss not pronouncing properly

---------08:46----------
it's clean this a little as we go to

---------08:50----------
stealing as Bad's his ex-girl more

---------09:05----------
okay is this a nub that's pretty stuff

---------09:09----------
let's see if that's

---------09:13----------
yeah

---------09:24----------
come on

---------09:25----------
[Music]

---------09:31----------
yeah

---------10:01----------
comes from this and goes to there as

---------10:02----------
where well okay 3.3 volts comes in

---------10:05----------
through this see what I'm pointing to

---------10:07----------
from here and then it goes to this pad

---------10:09----------
from this pad it then goes to this pad

---------10:12----------
I'm trying to figure out if I can make

---------10:14----------
this fix the connection between here and

---------10:16----------
here by digging into the board where it

---------10:18----------
was originally to avoid the misery of

---------10:20----------
running a wire from here to here which

---------10:22----------
would suck

---------10:32----------
and I dig and I dig and I see no nothing

---------10:37----------
let's get an exacto knife or something

---------10:39----------
take a little now that side right here

---------10:41----------
that you're talking about that's where

---------10:43----------
it does flip obviously down through the

---------10:45----------
opposite side of the board just from

---------10:46----------
this line where that and is yeah it's

---------10:51----------
gonna switch over well that's which over

---------10:54----------
the other side it's just is gonna be a

---------10:56----------
there's gonna be another layer under

---------10:58----------
this I'm trying to see if we can but

---------11:02----------
that nub is yeah I don't think there's

---------11:07----------
gonna be a nub down here I'm probably

---------11:09----------
gonna hit a ground plane before another

---------11:10----------
Oh what's this hello I see something I

---------11:18----------
see London I see France I see pp 3 V 3 s

---------11:22----------
oh where is that ground Oh way to find

---------11:25----------
out zoom what are you I found something

---------11:30----------
okay let's put the meter in beeping mode

---------11:33----------
and see if that goes to the up here

---------11:37----------
where I need it to

---------11:46----------
let's see if it's ground oh okay we

---------11:48----------
found it

---------11:49----------
so this goes to this here that finally

---------11:53----------
caught one live I'm looking to building

---------11:55----------
a high-five but I want high and then the

---------11:56----------
cheap buying a fix what do you say the

---------11:57----------
most troublesome component of block

---------11:58----------
repairing how hard would it be to find

---------12:01----------
the schematics most troublesome

---------12:03----------
components or the pair is a really

---------12:04----------
general question if you want to build a

---------12:05----------
hi-fi set up for cheap get the cheapest

---------12:08----------
old receiver that you can a set of van

---------12:10----------
der Steen speakers off audio gone for

---------12:12----------
like three or four hundred dollars they

---------12:14----------
are they are like in the ten to twenty

---------12:15----------
thousand dollar range but they what they

---------12:18----------
sound but they only cost three to four

---------12:20----------
hundred bucks times the hardest thing a

---------12:22----------
fix I suppose crap like this for sure so

---------12:25----------
now we have to do is we have to find a

---------12:27----------
way to solder to that nub so what I'm

---------12:29----------
gonna do is find a solder ball and shove

---------12:32----------
it in there

---------12:33----------
and try to use it from my SMC rework

---------12:36----------
stick the stencil thingy so you know

---------12:38----------
what I'm trying to solder an SMC and all

---------12:39----------
my balls fly away yeah I save them

---------12:42----------
you should always save your spare balls

---------12:43----------
you never know when you're gonna need

---------12:44----------
them later you never know when you're

---------12:46----------
gonna need a spare set of balls

---------12:47----------
especially if you get into a custody

---------12:48----------
battle cuz Jesus they'll be gone before

---------12:51----------
you know it so I'm gonna try and put a

---------12:53----------
ball in there then I'm gonna solder a

---------12:55----------
wire between here and here and then I'm

---------12:57----------
gonna put an LED driver on and pray that

---------12:59----------
that doesn't fall away love your videos

---------13:02----------
inspired me to get in repair Thank You

---------13:05----------
s7j 7 d 7 all right so we dug and we

---------13:09----------
found some buried treasure

---------13:11----------
ah ok so for me that's this is what I

---------13:16----------
made the mistake of doing that's like

---------13:17----------
let me just go you were trying to run

---------13:19----------
the wire around the wire Jesus get it to

---------13:21----------
the spot I was like let me just cut out

---------13:23----------
all just go straight to it yeah good

---------13:27----------
interesting stuff do you know at least I

---------13:29----------
got common sense though I've lost a lot

---------13:30----------
of things common sense so we dig the

---------13:35----------
work you're doing reminds me of the

---------13:36----------
dentist and it's scaring the crap oh

---------13:38----------
yeah I can't stand going to the dentist

---------13:39----------
either I still have my wisdom teeth I'm

---------13:42----------
far too much of a [ __ ] to have the

---------13:43----------
needle shoved in my mouth and had

---------13:46----------
somebody yank on it yeah all right so

---------13:51----------
here's what we got to do I got a place

---------13:52----------
of solder ball in there and then melt it

---------13:55----------
and then it'll turn into a pad

---------13:57----------
so let's get a solder ball and just to

---------14:01----------
give you an idea this is these are the

---------14:02----------
ends of tweezers this is a single solder

---------14:05----------
ball and that is the size of the pad

---------14:08----------
that we're trying to put it on for those

---------14:11----------
viewing at home that is aggravatingly

---------14:14----------
tiny so we're gonna try and melt that

---------14:16----------
onto there after all the people who

---------14:19----------
asked us my repair ready yet for

---------14:20----------
everybody who asks is it is my repair

---------14:23----------
ready I have an extension for that

---------14:32----------
actually let's see yeah

---------14:34----------
do you what do you use for the phone

---------14:36----------
system me yeah I mean I'd work oh no a

---------14:44----------
friend for the business

---------14:45----------
oh we just use our regular service like

---------14:47----------
BIOS because I have yeah I have a bunch

---------14:49----------
of these different extensions we created

---------14:51----------
where it's like let's see I was

---------14:52----------
wondering because anytime I call you get

---------14:54----------
there I have all these different

---------15:00----------
extensions for stuff like that downside

---------15:05----------
of being part of the franchise is

---------15:08----------
Michael you um when you're part of a

---------15:10----------
franchise I think you start to lose the

---------15:13----------
ability to have that freedom you can't

---------15:15----------
select you can't be selected you can't

---------15:17----------
be selected I send all the douchebag

---------15:18----------
customers to Sonny I I personally they

---------15:21----------
say they lose people Kay I'll get these

---------15:23----------
people coming in and you know they fight

---------15:26----------
and fight and I'm like man if you

---------15:28----------
weren't it was a regular guy on the

---------15:31----------
street you'd be get the out but the

---------15:36----------
ball is too big yeah I need a smaller

---------15:41----------
ball

---------15:44----------
I said here I won't pay child support

---------15:46----------
anyway that's not a good thing

---------15:48----------
you should pay child support or is $2

---------15:51----------
enough that ball looks like it may be a

---------16:00----------
little too big for this application as

---------16:01----------
well okay let's see do I have any hopes

---------16:04----------
of tinning it with this

---------16:20----------
gentle

---------16:23----------
and so good alright thanks for giving me

---------16:31----------
the confidence to repair my own plasma

---------16:33----------
TV only through the I'm missin it let's

---------16:39----------
find out where that way

---------16:52----------
how does this work

---------16:57----------
[Music]

---------17:04----------
Jesus your wife

---------17:09----------
thanks for giving me the confidence to

---------17:11----------
fix my own plasma TV only through hell

---------17:13----------
caps but it's a start if you made it

---------17:16----------
work again that's great honestly even if

---------17:18----------
you didn't make a work again but you

---------17:19----------
opened and you learn something that's

---------17:20----------
great good on you all right it's got to

---------17:28----------
be an old TV if it's plasma all right so

---------17:33----------
I let's try and stretch that wire over

---------17:35----------
now

---------17:50----------
I actually want to solder it to the left

---------17:53----------
section first so that it's so that I'm

---------17:56----------
not yanking on that crappy little

---------17:58----------
whatever's left of that pad yeah so now

---------18:02----------
I have the freedom to scrape all this

---------18:06----------
away Paul's not here so he won't line

---------18:10----------
that I'm scraping the board with his $50

---------18:12----------
iron tip that we only have one left of

---------18:15----------
I'm sure Paul is fine with me destroying

---------18:17----------
the last of the t30 - can he's a cool

---------18:21----------
guy like that can you bridge that with

---------18:27----------
solder alone maybe but it probably

---------18:29----------
wouldn't last and I don't want to mess

---------18:30----------
it up too much stuff should last

---------18:39----------
chuckles now now I got a nice strong

---------18:42----------
base for this to be attached to now I

---------18:45----------
gotta just get that little wire in there

---------18:49----------
and get it soldered to my bead it's up

---------18:53----------
the light since were upping the zoom you

---------18:54----------
won't be able to see very well light out

---------18:59----------
of being too much flux there's no such

---------19:02----------
thing we said too much flux what channel

---------19:05----------
you think you

---------19:09----------
[Music]

---------19:21----------
okay I think that's connected

---------19:27----------
blending

---------19:31----------
so now

---------19:34----------
you're gonna remove the excess wire and

---------19:39----------
see if we did actually works so how do

---------19:42----------
we tell if this works

---------19:43----------
oh we have to beep it so take this you

---------19:52----------
wait when I meters not on beep mode

---------19:54----------
isn't there we go beep yes all right so

---------19:59----------
now we got to put a chip on there and

---------20:00----------
hopefully that wire doesn't move in

---------20:02----------
confident that that wire is not going to

---------20:03----------
move

---------20:34----------
[Music]

---------20:36----------
now when you so when you're testing the

---------20:39----------
continuity mm-hmm doing this beep test

---------20:41----------
just because it's it's going like from

---------20:45----------
point A to point B is that guaranteed

---------20:48----------
also and this is something I've always

---------20:49----------
really never tested for but that it's

---------20:52----------
gonna have that 3 volt directly there it

---------20:56----------
should as long as there's 3.3 volts

---------20:57----------
there like it should have 3.3 volts over

---------21:00----------
here since we reconnected the break over

---------21:02----------
here now even if it doesn't let's say

---------21:04----------
the 3.3 volts is created inside the

---------21:06----------
board I don't even care at that point

---------21:07----------
because I can just wire it to here which

---------21:09----------
is infinitely easier than wiring it to

---------21:11----------
there but I think we already measured

---------21:13----------
that we had 3.3 volts at that point

---------21:15----------
prior to yeah doing all that stuff you

---------21:18----------
know after I scraped that area I think I

---------21:20----------
measured for 3.3 so now all that's left

---------21:22----------
to do is shove the chip on and but this

---------21:26----------
way oh by the way I really do love this

---------21:29----------
quick I like this station I mean I came

---------21:32----------
here I was like Steve you got it let me

---------21:33----------
get it

---------21:34----------
I gotta do it today I can't run like

---------21:36----------
that like this is not an ad for those

---------21:38----------
watching at home this is not an ad may

---------21:45----------
be kind of an ad why didn't place the

---------21:49----------
chip before why would I want to knock

---------21:52----------
into the chip while I'm doing this why

---------21:53----------
would you torture yourself yeah also how

---------21:56----------
do you test the continuity how do you

---------21:58----------
know if you won remember we don't test

---------22:01----------
up

---------22:01----------
wait is this

---------22:04----------
we throw it together and they're back to

---------22:06----------
the customer and wait for them to return

---------22:08----------
from work

---------22:08----------
same here who needs quality control

---------22:11----------
waste of money

---------22:24----------
I think the biggest waste of money is

---------22:26----------
what I was trying to do which was just

---------22:28----------
not buy a chip that has balls on it it's

---------22:31----------
like the chip is 2 bucks if you are that

---------22:34----------
dumb you can't speak the colors of it

---------22:36----------
tip I mean for me I just I really want

---------22:38----------
to walk like you know what I'm just well

---------22:43----------
yeah ok so I think right do you have the

---------22:48----------
screen yeah a modified of Fox and Hound

---------22:59----------
detector with pointy tip to help find

---------23:02----------
traces loud audio or traces silent where

---------23:05----------
traces broke get at Home Depot oh

---------23:09----------
they're hot on your microphone going

---------23:17----------
interesting maybe it's just that crappy

---------23:21----------
lavalier that I have is actually yeah

---------23:23----------
because yours is pointing at me oh I

---------23:28----------
hate lavalier microphones everybody asks

---------23:31----------
why I wear the ShamWow one but every

---------23:38----------
single video I've ever seen on YouTube

---------23:39----------
they manage to be able to wear a

---------23:40----------
lavalier mic and I still haven't figured

---------23:42----------
it out for years in okay so let's see if

---------23:51----------
this blows up everything

---------24:01----------
do you blow up this is gonna do the UH

---------24:31----------
Knopf on off on off on nonsense let's

---------24:36----------
get the light up oh hey light yeah for

---------24:55----------
those people who think I'm scamming

---------24:57----------
right all right let's see what huh oh

---------25:06----------
yeah no blinking no blinking so you

---------25:15----------
think that often make you do it actually

---------25:17----------
yeah practice is sick yeah because I

---------25:22----------
need to all right even though it's not

---------25:24----------
something I think our business is geared

---------25:28----------
towards for those who don't know we are

---------25:31----------
not board specialists in any way shape

---------25:33----------
or form but now if I take what if I take

---------25:36----------
it off and you can reattach it oh yeah

---------25:38----------
all right let's see let's stuff that the

---------25:41----------
chat decide should I take this off so

---------25:43----------
then make him reattach it so that he

---------25:45----------
learns or should we leave it as is

---------25:46----------
because it works

---------25:47----------
I came to be shamed and learned a lesson

---------25:51----------
so okay okay let's do it for fun okay

---------26:02----------
get those lights offices avocado

---------26:17----------
all right back to the drawing board

---------26:32----------
take it off all right cool well wait for

---------26:40----------
this day should be fun all right

---------26:49----------
you don't mind it pull the wire out to

---------26:52----------
do everything which wire the wires gun

---------26:54----------
Oh anyway you already took it out yeah

---------26:57----------
you want me to take a driver off too and

---------26:59----------
then redo it I think Yuki let's see if

---------27:01----------
you can do it with the driver there all

---------27:03----------
right mrs. never touch a running system

---------27:09----------
what is the fun of that all right where

---------27:21----------
is your flex in your everywhere

---------27:25----------
his giant tubes I just wondered what

---------27:28----------
this would be like I'm so stuck on quick

---------27:35----------
where's your wire it's on the spool

---------27:38----------
right above this out of spool of course

---------27:40----------
it would be

---------27:49----------
I am going to go damn straight tear us

---------27:51----------
practice makes perfect

---------28:53----------
now here's what's existing nope you're

---------28:59----------
not gonna be cheap today not when Lewis

---------29:02----------
has a giant thing of solder

---------30:25----------
legitimately flexed an hour

---------30:39----------
I'm a fan of these tweezers

---------31:02----------
and so I tell if both sides can move see

---------31:07----------
it's not about

---------31:14----------
[Music]

---------32:05----------
maybe she didn't know better an old lady

---------32:15----------
to put a book and put a balloon in front

---------32:18----------
of the camera maybe everybody hires

---------32:25----------
idiots you know but you never know and a

---------32:35----------
person you're hiring is an idiot maybe

---------32:37----------
you is that man sir

---------32:39----------
where

---------32:44----------
you can actually do the search

---------32:47----------
needle let's read some YouTube comments

---------32:55----------
nice Samsung care shirt a student from

---------32:57----------
Ubik I fix not student not student just

---------33:03----------
really wish I could go back in time to

---------33:05----------
those days thought you know it's all

---------33:09----------
right now here's

---------33:16----------
I'm debating between the quick 861 DW

---------33:19----------
and de do you think that 200 watts and

---------33:21----------
80 litres extra is worth $100 now you

---------33:23----------
don't need the power that this thing has

---------33:25----------
I mean I use it on 120 but that's

---------33:27----------
because I'm stubborn and impatient I

---------33:29----------
should not be using this on 120 ever I'm

---------33:31----------
just you know I I i like turning things

---------33:34----------
i have the same a bad habit with the air

---------33:35----------
conditioner if I'm warm

---------33:37----------
I turn it to the lowest setting and then

---------33:39----------
I wonder a few minutes later when it's

---------33:40----------
55 degrees why I'm freezing you really

---------33:42----------
don't need more power than this unless

---------33:44----------
you're trying to blast the board from

---------33:45----------
the other room what this is not where

---------33:52----------
you put that that's not it yeah I didn't

---------33:55----------
even put the ball I just find up using

---------33:56----------
the no oil no that was there but what's

---------33:59----------
striking to me is that that's not that

---------34:05----------
doesn't look so dreary

---------34:06----------
no I know it's not so I'm saying the

---------34:07----------
thing is but not like it's co-star I

---------34:12----------
don't know if it got on the end

---------34:13----------
how does he scrape you scrape it back

---------34:15----------
and forth I make

---------34:26----------
now let's move me out of the way

---------34:35----------
I think that is a shape forward is this

---------34:39----------
gonna get there's only one way to find

---------34:41----------
out also do you know that you have to

---------34:43----------
scrape the enamel off it why am I

---------34:46----------
reading the comments you know how an

---------34:47----------
moai works right yeah okay codon I don't

---------34:49----------
know what yeah I was wrong I went

---------34:51----------
through those reading the comments I

---------34:52----------
shouldn't have done their soldering are

---------34:55----------
from here to here is fun how can you use

---------34:58----------
this tip of the soldering iron I like

---------35:00----------
the settling iron it has a it's it's a

---------35:02----------
knife tip it's so it's

---------35:16----------
lucky duck us-canadian ubi effers don't

---------35:20----------
didn't get fancy shirts even though we

---------35:21----------
got Samsung authorized first Wow bold

---------35:25----------
statement bold statement my message

---------35:30----------
above says it all seriously grateful for

---------35:31----------
everything I've learned from your

---------35:32----------
starting my own business for a pair

---------35:34----------
modding and design no bull you've made a

---------35:35----------
huge positive impact in my life

---------35:39----------
thank you I stopped there because I'm

---------35:40----------
used to reading POS as a different

---------35:42----------
acronym

---------35:54----------
as sloppy as this

---------35:58----------
I might have made it there's lunch

---------36:05----------
well Canadian you Bevers

---------36:14----------
wonder if that store on 38 West 8th

---------36:16----------
Street is still open that was the one I

---------36:17----------
was gonna rent before this one but this

---------36:18----------
old lady didn't make she did she didn't

---------36:21----------
let me take it really yeah

---------36:22----------
I'll tell you the one that we got you

---------36:24----------
know there's some people don't realize

---------36:25----------
about New York and that is if you can

---------36:28----------
make a successful business now I'm

---------36:30----------
starting to think it really doesn't

---------36:32----------
matter what it is if you can have a

---------36:33----------
successful business in New York you can

---------36:35----------
have a business anywhere people don't

---------36:36----------
understand how hard it is how just

---------36:39----------
because there's more people not everyone

---------36:41----------
I mean in a business like this you have

---------36:43----------
to rely on something breaking something

---------36:44----------
right yeah I solely survive off broken

---------36:47----------
screens that is what you briefed ethics

---------36:49----------
came up on so people don't break their

---------36:50----------
screens well guess what we're should a

---------36:53----------
hell-like yeah and the rent doesn't

---------36:54----------
change you're still getting twenty

---------36:55----------
thousand dollars a month in bills so

---------36:57----------
it's like yeah I understand how hard it

---------36:59----------
is for somewhere out here compared to

---------37:00----------
anywhere else especially in this

---------37:01----------
industry when I read people's rents

---------37:03----------
other in other places I just want to

---------37:04----------
take the tweezers and shove him in my

---------37:05----------
eye when I saw that I was like and how

---------37:07----------
much for those underground spots again

---------37:10----------
Michael Ober dick was telling me the

---------37:12----------
rates he was paying for these three or

---------37:13----------
four thousand square-foot warehouses and

---------37:15----------
I'm like you both rang but easy so then

---------37:21----------
I have to lose weight so that I could

---------37:22----------
fit through my door after this right

---------37:26----------
because you bit since extra small

---------37:28----------
Samsung shoots Canada you could take

---------37:30----------
this off my hands if you want I think

---------37:34----------
we're good yep plug it in and see what

---------37:38----------
you get there's no beeping since the

---------37:40----------
chip is already iOS and say it's already

---------37:41----------
through there

---------37:42----------
so where's your cable zone I should be

---------37:47----------
Power you know I put your screen over

---------37:49----------
here

---------37:56----------
we don't need your data your data is not

---------37:58----------
important to us all right your monies

---------38:01----------
let's see if we get a light a green

---------38:04----------
light a backlight a orange light and

---------38:07----------
anyway I'll settle for anything on it I

---------38:14----------
paid $300 a month for rent damn the

---------38:17----------
Midwest feels good oh yeah go

---------38:19----------
yourself Kersey yeah yeah but he said

---------38:33----------
probably pay $300 yeah whatever $300 I

---------38:37----------
got a $2.00 electric bill is that New

---------38:40----------
York's uh McDonald's revised a menu

---------38:42----------
pricing right now we're cheeseburger

---------38:50----------
almost Oh happens to meet you yeah I

---------38:57----------
hate the on off on off on off on nature

---------38:58----------
of this one because it gives it's so

---------39:00----------
much dispensed to see if it actually

---------39:01----------
works

---------39:02----------
why is that today all right I don't know

---------39:05----------
why this model has an RTC reset when you

---------39:07----------
unplug the battery in the charger it

---------39:08----------
doesn't at the same time yes like t da

---------39:14----------
ha oh I should move there's a light and

---------39:17----------
for those of you don't believe it the

---------39:19----------
conspirators am all right a lot all

---------39:22----------
screen repair guys have to stick with

---------39:25----------
four screen repairs that was fun

---------39:26----------
when you Biff is done so so what do you

---------39:30----------
boo you originally doing and what would

---------39:32----------
you do different next time okay so this

---------39:34----------
is what I did the first time I didn't

---------39:36----------
look okay pulled up this mess I was

---------39:38----------
hitting look at semantics I looked at

---------39:39----------
the schematic I found where that went to

---------39:42----------
I didn't check to see where the closest

---------39:45----------
jump point was I didn't think of

---------39:47----------
anything other than I need to make this

---------39:50----------
pad that's gone when I put this

---------39:52----------
capacitor down have some sort of life so

---------39:55----------
I jumped straight to what was at number

---------39:58----------
14 off of the driver and I ran that wire

---------40:01----------
and left it there for me to stare out

---------40:04----------
for like two hours

---------40:05----------
I didn't do after I put that down I

---------40:07----------
didn't test anything I didn't run any

---------40:08----------
type of testing I didn't use my

---------40:10----------
multimeter nothing I just went off pure

---------40:12----------
instinct this looks up we run the

---------40:15----------
wire to the thing that looks minced up

---------40:16----------
exactly that was the goal was let me be

---------40:19----------
a jackass and run a wire into the thing

---------40:21----------
that looks the most messed up and I did

---------40:22----------
and granite if there was some sort of

---------40:25----------
nub or anything there I probably would

---------40:27----------
have been but the second I got to that

---------40:29----------
point I realized unless I know where I

---------40:32----------
can see people through with you coming

---------40:34----------
from is it coming from the driver is it

---------40:36----------
coming from that capacitor to the driver

---------40:37----------
is that where that you know inputs

---------40:40----------
coming from what is the true diagnostic

---------40:43----------
so I think if you were gonna get

---------40:45----------
anywhere close to board repair the phone

---------40:47----------
repaired to anything if you don't

---------40:48----------
diagnose it you're a fool you're an

---------40:50----------
absolute fool there's a lot of digging

---------40:52----------
to do to get today and there is I mean

---------40:54----------
but yeah you got a dick through a few

---------40:55----------
layers of board you got it and just you

---------40:57----------
know a few minutes to get to that and

---------40:59----------
obviously the you know the difference

---------41:00----------
between us is to do this for a living

---------41:02----------
and we find some of them the fun thing

---------41:04----------
is when you dig you're actually digging

---------41:06----------
down the newer retinas the part that

---------41:08----------
blows up by the LED driver when you dig

---------41:10----------
through it you actually get a sleep

---------41:12----------
signal so when you're somebody that I I

---------41:14----------
had that happen where I dug and I dug

---------41:16----------
like yeah I found the signal but I dug

---------41:18----------
through three layers of sleep sleep so

---------41:21----------
every time they would close the computer

---------41:23----------
and put it to sleep it would it would it

---------41:25----------
would crash upon real waking and I said

---------41:27----------
but you have backlight now and then

---------41:28----------
you'd be able to crashes when it sleeps

---------41:29----------
and they said it has backlight down and

---------41:32----------
I said well what do you leave it over I

---------41:34----------
want everything you got a desktop now do

---------41:36----------
you want everything you want no light

---------41:38----------
what's more useful to you at least now

---------41:40----------
you can turn it on you want a caddy

---------41:41----------
rather flashlight and you know I think

---------41:44----------
customers obviously got to understand to

---------41:46----------
like what they're bringing you know and

---------41:48----------
and the thing with this is I'm in the

---------41:51----------
spot so many times where we see people

---------41:52----------
come in and they want stuff same day two

---------41:54----------
hours you know can you do it and then

---------41:56----------
they hear anything over a hundred

---------41:58----------
dollars and it's you guys I'm out

---------42:00----------
it's like okay well go buy a new

---------42:02----------
thousand dollar computer then enjoy it

---------42:04----------
yeah I would say you know differently in

---------42:06----------
the future again your multimeter is your

---------42:08----------
friend dig 110 percent dig and try to

---------42:11----------
find the lazy way out because running

---------42:13----------
the wire under the chip is very hard so

---------42:15----------
I just looked for the lazy way out you

---------42:17----------
know I thought it would have been a lot

---------42:18----------
easier cuz I'm

---------42:19----------
like alright this enameled wire I don't

---------42:21----------
think it'll be an issue if I run it

---------42:23----------
around this ball and then I mean I swear

---------42:25----------
it instantly that I put heat to it I

---------42:27----------
just watched that wires straighten

---------42:28----------
itself out and bridge two bolts and I'm

---------42:31----------
like well there's nothing works with two

---------42:32----------
balls and a wire running through it I

---------42:34----------
mean I try to avoid running jumpers and

---------42:35----------
their chips whenever possible because

---------42:37----------
it's no fun yeah see if we have any fun

---------42:39----------
comments before leaving I'll take your

---------42:43----------
shirt that I'm XL glad to see you're

---------42:44----------
doing more than the screens I'm working

---------42:46----------
towards the same thing

---------42:47----------
