---------00:00----------
what okay this must be addressed before

---------00:02----------
that wrong screws aha this is so

---------00:06----------
triggering okay you know what I just

---------00:07----------
can't look at that section because I'm

---------00:09----------
never gonna get to you but what the hell

---------00:10----------
wrong screw wrong screw no what is this

---------00:15----------
why is this not even this goes under the

---------00:19----------
speaker Wi-Fi card goes under speaker

---------00:22----------
not over speaker that's wrong ah ah

---------00:28----------
action hey everybody how's it going

---------00:30----------
today we've got an 8 12 78 it's got no

---------00:32----------
USB ports now there's a couple of ways

---------00:34----------
that we're gonna go about

---------00:35----------
troubleshooting this the first thing I'm

---------00:36----------
interested in is it is it both USB ports

---------00:39----------
not working or is it one USB port not

---------00:41----------
working because if it's one USB port not

---------00:43----------
working that's gonna be a different

---------00:45----------
problem because often there are

---------00:46----------
different USB hubs in some of these

---------00:48----------
older machines for each port so for

---------00:51----------
example some USB port hubs may also

---------00:54----------
include stuff like Bluetooth or the

---------00:57----------
webcam or the SD card reader or the

---------01:00----------
keyboard so if there are certain groups

---------01:02----------
of items not working this helps me

---------01:03----------
narrow down what it is if it's both USB

---------01:05----------
ports not working it's often not going

---------01:06----------
to be the hub because there are

---------01:08----------
different USB hubs her port so if it's

---------01:10----------
both not working could be a power issue

---------01:12----------
where the chip in common between the two

---------01:14----------
which is the power supply could have

---------01:16----------
failed you never know so it's very

---------01:17----------
interesting detective work here and I'd

---------01:19----------
like to walk you through it so let's

---------01:21----------
open this up and see what's going on and

---------01:24----------
see if there's anything obvious going on

---------01:26----------
here and then try it with a u USB to see

---------01:32----------
which ports have failed wow this is old

---------01:36----------
this is a Sandy Bridge CPU Sandy Bridge

---------01:40----------
alright nothing looks too out of place

---------01:43----------
by the USB section which is right over

---------01:45----------
here let's open up a schematic for this

---------01:47----------
eight to zero twenty nine thirty six

---------01:49----------
this ancient piece of kit right here so

---------01:52----------
check this out let's go over to USB so

---------01:55----------
see this external USB a goes to USB hub

---------02:01----------
two external USB B goes to USB hub one

---------02:04----------
so if one port is not working we could

---------02:08----------
potentially blame a hub but if both

---------02:09----------
ports are not working then whatever is

---------02:11----------
in common between them is usually what's

---------02:13----------
wrong

---------02:13----------
which is either power supply easy or PCH

---------02:17----------
Paul Q so let's go over to the power

---------02:22----------
circuit so I can show you what I mean

---------02:23----------
when I say what they have in common well

---------02:26----------
if you take a look over here you

---------02:28----------
46-hundred has two outputs

---------02:30----------
it has PP 5 es 3 a 5 volt power rail in

---------02:33----------
and then it outputs to each USB over

---------02:36----------
here and over here now usually these

---------02:41----------
filters over here don't actually blow

---------02:43----------
because this chip if it detects a

---------02:45----------
short-circuit automatically turns off

---------02:47----------
power to the port which is really cool

---------02:48----------
but most of the time when there's a

---------02:50----------
short to ground that's actually the that

---------02:52----------
ship itself the power wise I see that

---------02:54----------
it's failed so I'm gonna grab a USB

---------02:57----------
drive and see which port it is one or

---------03:01----------
both of them that are not working

---------03:02----------
holding down the option key my auto

---------03:09----------
focus is kind of working funky in my

---------03:11----------
camera today

---------03:11----------
what the hell Sony WTF focus you so the

---------03:19----------
that port is not working let's try the

---------03:21----------
other one neither port appears to be

---------03:28----------
functioning now we're going to see if we

---------03:34----------
have 5 volts in either port

---------04:19----------
zero volts on USB zero volts on USB so

---------04:27----------
I'm gonna unplug power going to the

---------04:29----------
system it's fine I'm not booted into an

---------04:30----------
operating system so I don't throw about

---------04:32----------
corrupting any drives and we're going to

---------04:34----------
see if we get a short to ground no short

---------04:40----------
no short interesting okay now we're

---------04:46----------
gonna take a look at the power IC itself

---------04:50----------
which is U 4600 now remember for this to

---------04:53----------
turn on DDR reg enable has to be present

---------04:55----------
on pins four and five so you have input

---------04:58----------
PP 5 es 3 obviously that rail is present

---------05:01----------
because if it wasn't the board wouldn't

---------05:02----------
turn on PP 5 es 3 we got that you have

---------05:05----------
to have output which we don't have at

---------05:07----------
either filter and technically it is

---------05:10----------
possible that both filters blue but

---------05:12----------
those filters never blow so I'm not

---------05:13----------
worried about that when I say filters I

---------05:14----------
mean L 4605 in l 46:15 it's what sits

---------05:18----------
between the USB port in this chip it's

---------05:20----------
kind of acting as a fuse and also acting

---------05:22----------
to prevent you if you plug a device that

---------05:25----------
requires a large inrush of current that

---------05:27----------
it doesn't destroy the chip so let's see

---------05:30----------
what I get on pins 4 & 5 of this

---------05:32----------
beautiful chip and see if it's being

---------05:33----------
enabled and told to turn on also what's

---------05:35----------
really interesting and funny here is

---------05:36----------
they use a DDR reg enable signal to turn

---------05:40----------
on the USB that's kind of lazy I guess

---------05:44----------
any time you want your RAM to be powered

---------05:46----------
you also want USB to be powered because

---------05:48----------
Ram is gonna be powered in an s3 state

---------05:50----------
when the machine is sleeping and USB is

---------05:53----------
also going to be expected to work when

---------05:54----------
the machine is in an s3 state and

---------05:56----------
sleeping I just kind of find that

---------05:57----------
interesting that they use a ramp our

---------05:59----------
signal for the for this very very

---------06:02----------
strange

---------06:03----------
okay 3.3 n so the chip is being told to

---------06:08----------
output power

---------06:14----------
see we get on pins 8 or 9

---------06:23----------
see your L see your own way to point

---------06:27----------
eight okay that's four that's messed up

---------06:29----------
this shouldn't be 2.8 so time to remove

---------06:36----------
that chip and put a new one it's being

---------06:37----------
told with power on and it's not and

---------06:39----------
there's no short to ground on output

---------06:40----------
keeping it from powering on so I'm gonna

---------06:43----------
billion the chip there's nothing in that

---------06:47----------
area that I really have to worry about

---------06:48----------
burning on this board see this is an

---------06:50----------
obvious you got that experience be

---------06:52----------
careful with if you're ever gonna do

---------06:53----------
repairs with the board in the housing

---------06:55----------
but this is one where I can and I feel

---------06:57----------
really worried about ruining anything

---------07:09----------
I'm getting a phone call my delivery

---------07:10----------
[ __ ] that's my food and this short

---------07:13----------
Bluetooth doesn't have it's not smart

---------07:14----------
like the job or anything I can't go

---------07:16----------
answer come on [ __ ] come out before the

---------07:19----------
phone calls come on want my food

---------07:22----------
hello yes be right there my friend thank

---------07:27----------
you so much I just find my keys oh boy

---------07:34----------
my food is here oh boy oh boy oh boy oh

---------07:37----------
boy oh boy

---------07:39----------
lentils mmm

---------08:18----------
you know if I usually if I work by the

---------08:20----------
ISL at that point I usually take the RAM

---------08:22----------
out at least because the weight of the

---------08:24----------
RAM will pull the RAM slot a little if

---------08:28----------
you're heating it but this is far enough

---------08:29----------
away from the RAM slot that I don't have

---------08:30----------
to care just barely buy enough I'm gonna

---------08:36----------
use low airflow you'll see this will

---------08:38----------
slip right into place

---------08:40----------
oh that was beautiful so satisfying

---------08:45----------
putting too much solder on the center

---------08:47----------
pad is so satisfying I love it mm thick

---------08:51----------
Center pad twosies

---------08:58----------
now I got my micro pencil tip back I can

---------09:01----------
do this and this micro pencil tip cuts

---------09:06----------
through ground that is we come back this

---------09:09----------
little solder ball after you think it go

---------09:41----------
that's audible really doesn't want to

---------09:43----------
get sucked up by the micro pencil stop

---------09:47----------
not just remove it from the board no

---------09:49----------
biggie

---------09:50----------
all right let's see if we got USB we

---------09:53----------
have USB I can eat if we don't have USB

---------09:55----------
I cannot eat I have not earned a meal

---------09:57----------
yet I should fix at least three MacBooks

---------10:00----------
before what okay this must be addressed

---------10:02----------
before that wrong screws aha this is so

---------10:06----------
triggering okay you know what I just

---------10:08----------
can't look at that section because I'm

---------10:09----------
never gonna get to you but what the hell

---------10:11----------
wrong screw wrong screw no what is this

---------10:16----------
why is this not even this goes under the

---------10:20----------
speaker Wi-Fi card goes under speaker

---------10:23----------
not over speaker that's wrong ah ah no

---------10:30----------
I'm not gonna find screws for that right

---------10:32----------
now [ __ ] that it's midnight and I didn't

---------10:34----------
do that you did all right

---------10:41----------
it's wrong you can't leave it like that

---------10:45----------
no hey see what is this - show me show

---------10:53----------
me a USB you [ __ ] come on what

---------11:05----------
no power oh there we go okay now we have

---------11:10----------
one USB port not working so that port

---------11:13----------
works top port works bottom port says

---------11:18----------
what's wrong with bottom port do we

---------11:21----------
seriously have two issues on USB power

---------11:22----------
really really now

---------11:25----------
indeed his copass [ __ ] hiss alright

---------11:29----------
let's take a look at the board so it

---------11:31----------
looks like the port closest to the

---------11:32----------
display connector is the one that has a

---------11:35----------
problem that is gonna be J 46:10 J 46:10

---------11:39----------
is external USB B that goes to the

---------11:43----------
camera the IR and the IR controller so

---------11:45----------
we can test if this is a hub or

---------11:46----------
something else by trying the webcam so

---------11:49----------
I'm gonna boot up into or Hans operating

---------11:50----------
system and see if the webcam works

---------11:52----------
because if the webcam works then that

---------11:54----------
means it's not the USB hub it's

---------11:56----------
something upstream of the hub you

---------11:57----------
understand this may be an interesting

---------11:59----------
one to solve because it's gonna have

---------12:00----------
multiple problems so I'm gonna open up

---------12:03----------
photobooth in this operating system by

---------12:05----------
the way this is gonna boot at USB 2

---------12:07----------
because this piece of [ __ ] had USB 2 in

---------12:09----------
2011 I think it's time for me to start

---------12:11----------
eating my lentils I don't I don't have

---------12:14----------
the patience to wait for this to boot up

---------12:16----------
over USB 2 that's gonna be painful this

---------12:19----------
USB hub could be bad but if the camera

---------12:21----------
is working then I know that it's not

---------12:24----------
gonna be the USB hub see this is the

---------12:26----------
webcam connector J 3 for l2 they share a

---------12:28----------
common hub it could be something else

---------12:31----------
external USB this external USB J 46:10

---------12:35----------
it may also be the port that goes to the

---------12:37----------
SMC MUX chip so check this out you can

---------12:39----------
actually program the SMC over USB see

---------12:42----------
this over here USB SMC debug MUX see

---------12:46----------
this this allows you to have not have

---------12:51----------
the USB signal go to the PCH the SA

---------12:54----------
it'll actually the USB signal the USB

---------12:57----------
end will go straight to the SMC so you

---------12:59----------
could actually deal with the SMC via UA

---------13:02----------
you could plug something in via USB and

---------13:03----------
go straight to the system management

---------13:04----------
controller if it's enabled if USB

---------13:08----------
debugging enable L gets pulled up so

---------13:10----------
this is or down which is really cool but

---------13:12----------
that actually is for the port that's

---------13:14----------
working so this circuit is not going to

---------13:16----------
be a part of the problem

---------13:17----------
this circuit over here

---------13:19----------
is the port that doesn't have anything

---------13:20----------
to do with that so that's gonna point to

---------13:21----------
either a bad hub bad port or bad filter

---------13:25----------
now usually it's bad hub or bad filter

---------13:27----------
I'm gonna figure out if it's bad hub or

---------13:29----------
bad filter by logging in and seeing a

---------13:32----------
photo booth works with the webcam I

---------13:34----------
don't know what kind of weird sick porn

---------13:37----------
Orhan has on the desktop here so we're

---------13:38----------
gonna keep that private I don't want to

---------13:40----------
embarrass him in case he's got you know

---------13:42----------
some sort of like anime foot fetish or

---------13:45----------
something you're just gonna keep that

---------13:49----------
off the desktop for now

---------13:58----------
okay do they still have photobooth in

---------14:00----------
here yeah they do

---------14:01----------
alright so for open photobooth

---------14:18----------
I'm gonna cover all the point that Orhan

---------14:20----------
has in here so as you can see the camera

---------14:22----------
is working so since the camera is

---------14:24----------
working on this machine that means that

---------14:27----------
it's either an issue with the USB hub or

---------14:29----------
the filter for that port now let's take

---------14:31----------
a look inside that port eat your lentils

---------14:34----------
Luis do it I don't have USB it when I

---------14:37----------
have USB I'm allowed to eat my food only

---------14:39----------
once I have USB Khmer I eat my food I

---------14:41----------
haven't earned eating food yet food is a

---------14:45----------
privilege not a right

---------14:49----------
eating food before you fix customers

---------14:52----------
MacBook is not a V is not a human right

---------14:55----------
okay let's see is that port getting

---------15:00----------
power we should check that [ __ ] and also

---------15:02----------
see if the filter is kind of funky so

---------15:05----------
that's the port that's closest up let's

---------15:07----------
see where that filter is so if we look

---------15:09----------
on the board view that's gonna be L

---------15:12----------
46:10 that's for the data and then we

---------15:15----------
have D 46:10 which is going to be the

---------15:17----------
diode for data so you know what I made

---------15:20----------
do I may just replace this end that at

---------15:22----------
the same time let's go for it or you're

---------15:26----------
just gonna replace both at once

---------15:28----------
just pure savage with it savage beast

---------15:34----------
mode activated

---------15:40----------
and then I can eat the food but I am NOT

---------15:45----------
we got a deadline the queue is behind we

---------15:52----------
must fix things the queue is behind the

---------15:57----------
budget is gonna fix fix fix

---------16:08----------
six

---------16:10----------
and for there's no mac left to fix so

---------16:14----------
come on come off the board you know that

---------16:25----------
Diagon filter gun

---------16:38----------
dependable

---------16:41----------
[Music]

---------17:00----------
okay next donor board

---------18:11----------
your power chip is making good contact

---------18:14----------
pretty hot it bro cool down for a second

---------18:29----------
you know satyr blobs

---------18:36----------
rapid cool mofo Wow both USB ports work

---------18:39----------
that's the bottom USB port BAM

---------18:42----------
unplug top USB port BAM

---------18:46----------
so looks like over here we were having

---------18:49----------
both USB ports didn't work

---------18:51----------
now what happens of two USB ports have

---------18:53----------
in common the two things they both have

---------18:55----------
in common are a PCH which is like your

---------18:59----------
South Bridge in North Bridge all in one

---------19:00----------
or B the power chip now since the PCH is

---------19:04----------
a chip with hundreds and hundreds of

---------19:06----------
balls takes about an hour to replace and

---------19:08----------
the power trip is something that takes a

---------19:10----------
few you know minutes to replace I

---------19:11----------
decided to start diagnosing what would

---------19:13----------
be easy

---------19:14----------
rather than would be hard and also

---------19:15----------
that's something that even if we're not

---------19:16----------
we don't have an easy versus hard

---------19:17----------
judgement it's measuring the power lines

---------19:20----------
show it very easily that power wasn't

---------19:22----------
present both ports at that point I

---------19:23----------
replaced a power trip when getting power

---------19:25----------
to both ports but only one port is

---------19:27----------
working now once we have only one port

---------19:29----------
working I decided to check out the

---------19:31----------
schematic and see where this goes and if

---------19:34----------
you take a look at the schematic over

---------19:36----------
here where it shows you here we go where

---------19:40----------
it shows you how the USB ports work the

---------19:42----------
USB port that was working goes to a

---------19:43----------
different USB hub than the port that was

---------19:45----------
not working so no there a couple of

---------19:47----------
issues here could be an issue somewhere

---------19:48----------
else in the USB circuit eclis upstream

---------19:50----------
or it could be here now the way I test

---------19:53----------
that if the USB hub is the problem is by

---------19:55----------
checking what else is connected to it we

---------19:56----------
have a camera the IR sensor which is

---------19:58----------
that little remote that used to come I

---------20:00----------
think optional if you bought in a 1181

---------20:02----------
MacBook that evere remote in the box for

---------20:03----------
controlling iTunes

---------20:04----------
nobody [ __ ] uses that thing with in

---------20:06----------
it with with the 2012 or 2015 MacBook

---------20:08----------
but apparently the circuitry is still

---------20:10----------
included even though nobody in that

---------20:11----------
right mind uses that thing so the camera

---------20:14----------
was working I tried photobooth and I was

---------20:16----------
getting a picture which meant the USB

---------20:18----------
hub had to be good so it had to be

---------20:19----------
something with this USB so now if we

---------20:21----------
scroll back to where the USB was over

---------20:24----------
here it really really are running out of

---------20:26----------
things that it could be it could be the

---------20:28----------
data line between the USB hub and the

---------20:31----------
USB port it may could be the filter

---------20:32----------
there that filters gonna get rid of EMI

---------20:34----------
and radio frequencies and all that [ __ ]

---------20:36----------
it could be this diode to ground that's

---------20:38----------
bad or it could be the actual port

---------20:40----------
itself replacing the port is really hard

---------20:42----------
replacing these two is really easy and

---------20:43----------
it's honestly a coin toss at that point

---------20:45----------
as to what it is now people would say

---------20:47----------
how do you know that it's the

---------20:49----------
Coyle versus the port why wouldn't you

---------20:52----------
measure it with an oscilloscope and look

---------20:54----------
at the waveforms it's like dude you're

---------20:56----------
overcomplicating it this component cost

---------20:58----------
cents you can get off of a donor board

---------21:00----------
and if you're at all proficient with

---------21:03----------
soldering that takes what like all of

---------21:05----------
them 90 seconds to replace and it's it's

---------21:08----------
something that I replaced very quickly

---------21:09----------
and it's easier to do that than it is to

---------21:11----------
log out the oscilloscope not kidding

---------21:13----------
looking at the oscilloscope will take me

---------21:15----------
more time and then I had to just set up

---------21:18----------
and put on the bench and then they have

---------21:19----------
to use brain power does that look like a

---------21:21----------
working USB signal or not one of the

---------21:22----------
funny things I find when people are

---------21:24----------
always mentioning getting an

---------21:25----------
oscilloscope or using an oscilloscope is

---------21:27----------
they think once they can see waveforms

---------21:28----------
on the screen that they're gonna be able

---------21:30----------
to solve everything and when they get it

---------21:31----------
and they just see a little bit on the

---------21:33----------
screen they just go okay it's a nicely

---------21:36----------
squiggly stuff in the screen so what I

---------21:37----------
do to fix so that's about that that's

---------21:40----------
how we fixed and diagnosed as USB issue

---------21:42----------
what was interesting about this one is

---------21:44----------
that there were actually two separate

---------21:45----------
USB issues this is a very sneaky one a

---------21:47----------
no power and B issue and data line these

---------21:50----------
two may have been unrelated unless the

---------21:52----------
USB port somebody shorted something and

---------21:54----------
maybe sent five volts to the data line

---------21:56----------
which killed the filter but I don't

---------21:58----------
think that that filter is gonna die just

---------22:00----------
because he put five holes through I

---------22:01----------
think it's really interesting that we

---------22:02----------
had two different faults at the same

---------22:03----------
time not quite sure it would've caused

---------22:04----------
it but it does appear to work so at this

---------22:07----------
point I'm going to eat my lentils that

---------22:08----------
arrived because I'm hungry it's 12:00

---------22:10----------
12:00 a.m. and I think that that's

---------22:12----------
excellent time to eat my dinner just

---------22:14----------
leave notes for this ticket so that the
