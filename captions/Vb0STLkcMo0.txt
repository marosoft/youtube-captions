---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna be going

---------00:01----------
over um MacBook Pro with nothing on the

---------00:03----------
screen and we're gonna make a couple of

---------00:05----------
quick measurements to see what's going

---------00:07----------
on in the circuit before we do that I

---------00:09----------
want to see if I can find myself a

---------00:11----------
sample diagram that's worthwhile here

---------00:17----------
one of the funny things here with this

---------00:19----------
whole argument and I think a lot of

---------00:20----------
people are missing out on when they say

---------00:23----------
oh that's that's you know that's special

---------00:27----------
that's a secret that's this or that or

---------00:29----------
the other what I think they're missing

---------00:32----------
out on is that the circuit is almost the

---------00:35----------
exact same as what the actual

---------00:37----------
manufacturer includes in their own

---------00:39----------
diagram so if I were to just go over

---------00:42----------
here to this part of the screen and I

---------00:45----------
were to zoom in over here

---------00:47----------
most of the chipsets that I'm replacing

---------00:50----------
or teaching you you know what what the

---------00:51----------
things do they come with these little

---------00:54----------
simplified schematics and the whole idea

---------00:56----------
here is that it it's pretty much telling

---------00:58----------
you how to recreate the exact same

---------01:00----------
circuit and it's usually almost the

---------01:05----------
exact same thing as what the

---------01:07----------
manufacturer will use so if we were to

---------01:10----------
look over here this this little diagram

---------01:12----------
this is a backlight boost circuit and

---------01:15----------
you have the beginning which is going to

---------01:17----------
be 5.5 to 22 volts in the case of our

---------01:19----------
machine 12 volts at the end of it you're

---------01:21----------
gonna have something around 27 volts now

---------01:25----------
you're going to have the enable pin has

---------01:28----------
to get 3.3 volts the pwm pin is going to

---------01:31----------
have to get a little wave for the

---------01:33----------
brightness to work so if we were to

---------01:36----------
attach this the first thing that I like

---------01:38----------
to do when it comes to any of these

---------01:39----------
situations is measure the voltage on

---------01:41----------
output she'd see knowing what the

---------01:43----------
voltage and output is gonna tell me a

---------01:44----------
couple of things so for example zero

---------01:46----------
volts means most likely back light fuse

---------01:49----------
is blown or that it just doesn't see a

---------01:52----------
screen let's say 27 volts would say bad

---------01:57----------
screen 18 volts would say something is

---------01:59----------
going on most likely with the boost I

---------02:01----------
see the boost I see is probably bad and

---------02:03----------
something like at 50 or 51 volts is

---------02:06----------
going to say that there's a break in the

---------02:08----------
line so let's say the screen cable could

---------02:10----------
be bad or the LCD connector could have a

---------02:12----------
burnt pin

---------02:13----------
now something along the lines of let's

---------02:15----------
say 0.5 volts or 1 volt or 2 volts is

---------02:19----------
going to also mean a break in the line

---------02:21----------
but that's gonna be a break in the line

---------02:22----------
earlier on see the reason I would get a

---------02:24----------
higher voltage if there's a break in the

---------02:26----------
line at the end is that if the boost

---------02:28----------
circuit is working let's say the boost

---------02:29----------
circuit is actually working but it

---------02:31----------
doesn't see a load let's say it's trying

---------02:32----------
to make 27 volts while powering a screen

---------02:35----------
if there's no screen at the end or the

---------02:37----------
the backlight is part of the screen is

---------02:39----------
broken off then it's going to try to

---------02:42----------
create 27 volts for a load but if that

---------02:44----------
load doesn't exist then it's going to

---------02:46----------
deliver more voltage than chip so think

---------02:48----------
of it like armwrestling like let's say

---------02:50----------
you're armwrestling and trying to beat

---------02:51----------
the other person right and using as much

---------02:53----------
force as you can and the other person

---------02:54----------
just decides to go limp for a second

---------02:56----------
your arm is gonna smash its way into the

---------02:58----------
table because you were expecting the

---------03:01----------
resistance of that other person who's

---------03:02----------
trying to beat you in the armwrestling

---------03:03----------
match if that resistance goes away now

---------03:05----------
you just put you putting all that

---------03:07----------
pressure into nothing the same is true

---------03:08----------
here so let's just check out the

---------03:10----------
different voltages we get now remember

---------03:12----------
if it doesn't detect the screen that's

---------03:13----------
different than the backlight part being

---------03:15----------
burned out so let's say it detects the

---------03:17----------
screen sees the image and all that but

---------03:19----------
the one line that's required for

---------03:20----------
backlight is broken that's when you'll

---------03:22----------
see the really high voltage however if

---------03:24----------
you see no voltage that it because it

---------03:26----------
doesn't detect the screen that means

---------03:28----------
that there's something wrong with the

---------03:29----------
graphics that's there's something wrong

---------03:30----------
with the LCD itself or there's something

---------03:32----------
wrong with the DDC circuit which is all

---------03:34----------
totally separate so when I check

---------03:36----------
backlight output here on the multimeter

---------03:39----------
on the multimeter

---------03:42----------
I'm never gonna learn how to record

---------03:44----------
youtube video man this is Bush it's

---------03:47----------


---------03:47----------
it's like regardless of what camera

---------03:49----------
angle I use something doesn't

---------03:51----------
work or this we're gonna move this

---------03:53----------
desk here we go use those muscles mm-hm

---------03:58----------
alright so now our in view so let's

---------04:02----------
check output here and see what we get so

---------04:03----------
an output of backlight we get 1.5 volts

---------04:06----------
now keep in mind this is a circuit that

---------04:08----------
supposed to take 12 volt and turn into

---------04:09----------
27 so 1.5 doesn't make sense like 0

---------04:13----------
would mean blown fuse or it doesn't

---------04:15----------
detect the screen twelve volts would

---------04:17----------
mean no break in the line but there's

---------04:19----------
boosting but again like 1.5 something is

---------04:26----------
partially broken in the line

---------04:27----------
there's something that's intermittent

---------04:28----------
there and usually that's gonna be

---------04:30----------
somewhere back here let's see if I can

---------04:34----------
show you so usually that's going to be

---------04:36----------
somewhere by let's make sure CoA

---------04:40----------
connected here can you see what's on my

---------04:41----------
screen hope you can I forgot to turn on

---------04:42----------
the other second monitor that allows me

---------04:44----------
to see what you see let's double check

---------04:47----------
here there we go BAM

---------04:48----------
so this where the bat attaches to the

---------04:51----------
inductor sometimes that can be bad so we

---------04:54----------
could trace our way back through the

---------04:55----------
entire circuit now I do know based on a

---------04:59----------
little birdie telling me that the

---------05:01----------
voltage from the bat from here that's

---------05:04----------
the input to the coil also goes to

---------05:08----------
enable right so if I wanted to do a

---------05:10----------
quick check what I could do is I could

---------05:12----------
measure the voltage right at the

---------05:15----------
resistors that leads to enable and see

---------05:19----------
what I get there one point seven so same

---------05:24----------
 so the entire input to the circuit

---------05:27----------
is getting me virtually nothing now if I

---------05:29----------
were to check at the backlight fuse BAM

---------05:33----------
12.5 BAM 12.5 so here's the way this

---------05:38----------
works so there is a backlight fuse wrong

---------05:41----------
wrong view there's a back there's a fuse

---------05:44----------
that goes between the 12 volt rail in

---------05:46----------
here and then there's a transistor over

---------05:48----------
here that then allows power to flow

---------05:50----------
through to here it allows it to flow

---------05:52----------
through to here and everything else so

---------05:54----------
now what I'm thinking if this power at

---------05:56----------
the fuse day we're gonna have drawing

---------05:57----------
time with Lois so we're going to put off

---------06:10----------
fuse and that's going to go to

---------06:39----------
it's going to go to a transistor

---------07:01----------
here we go

---------07:03----------
image

---------07:07----------
BAM ahem yeah this there we go

---------07:25----------
alright so the way this works is this is

---------07:26----------
a transistor over here so this is going

---------07:30----------
to allow power to flow to the back light

---------07:32----------
circuit so this is gonna be the source

---------07:33----------
this is gonna be the drain which is the

---------07:36----------
output and this is gonna be the gate so

---------07:37----------
the way it transistor works is the power

---------07:39----------
is gonna flow from the source to the

---------07:41----------
drain depending on what's on the gate

---------07:42----------
now the whole idea here is you don't

---------07:44----------
always want the light to be on so the

---------07:46----------
cpu over here is going to tell the

---------07:48----------
transistor when to allow power to flow

---------07:50----------
from the fuse to the to the entire back

---------07:54----------
light circuits so what we have over here

---------07:55----------
is a case where the output is 1.5 volts

---------08:00----------
over here so this this we measured 1.5

---------08:04----------
volts now over here we measured 1.5

---------08:07----------
volts over here we measured 1.5 volts

---------08:12----------
over here we measured 12 over here we

---------08:16----------
measured 12 so the issue is either that

---------08:19----------
the transistor is not opening right the

---------08:21----------
transistor is not opening the way it's

---------08:23----------
supposed to or there's a break in the

---------08:25----------
line so for example right at this

---------08:28----------
transistor there's a break which where

---------08:29----------
it goes from here to here so our two

---------08:32----------
issues could be either the transistor is

---------08:34----------
 like this hopefully I have

---------08:37----------
control Z because I did a lot of druga

---------08:38----------
drawing there or there's a break in the

---------08:40----------
line like this make sense so what I'm

---------08:45----------
gonna do now is I'm gonna flip the board

---------08:46----------
around I'm gonna turn the microscope

---------08:48----------
camera on and then we're going to see

---------08:50----------
what where the break is exactly okay so

---------08:52----------
as you can see here this is a standard

---------08:54----------
standard customer MacBook very clean

---------08:56----------
very well taken care of you know very

---------08:58----------
very clean you know this standard stuff

---------09:02----------
hey Lois why do you wear gloves in your

---------09:04----------
videos hey Lois why do you wear gloves

---------09:06----------
in your videos hey why do you wear

---------09:07----------
gloves hey you have OCD man why do you

---------09:09----------
wear gloves why do you have to wear

---------09:11----------
gloves to touch a computer hey I don't

---------09:13----------
get it why do you why do you always

---------09:15----------
wearing gloves in all these videos yeah

---------09:18----------
you like that you like that you want to

---------09:20----------
touch that if I gave you a million

---------09:22----------
dollars to lick that clock chip would

---------09:25----------
you accept that million dollar challenge

---------09:27----------
million dollars to lick this motherboard

---------09:30----------
the rights are a pair bill would be

---------09:32----------
passed if I licked this motherboard you

---------09:34----------
know what I'd rather just throw

---------09:36----------
away and go to the genes

---------09:38----------
no it's not that so okay let's

---------09:42----------
measure let's measure around let's stop

---------09:43----------
 around yeah get the I

---------09:48----------
can't get camera angles right to save my

---------09:50----------
life okay now I do this I have to do

---------09:57----------
this now so you can see oh man I suck at

---------10:02----------
filming all right so let's check out we

---------10:04----------
get at the output of the transistor so

---------10:07----------
the transistors output is 1.8

---------10:10----------
transistors input you got 12 on em right

---------10:18----------
here we go okay so this is all right so

---------10:26----------
let's let's reconvene here let's let's

---------10:28----------
get it alright so this is a bit of a

---------10:30----------
better version I thinks of what's going

---------10:32----------
on so the way that this works is you

---------10:33----------
have 12 volts going through a fuse from

---------10:35----------
the fuse that power goes to a transistor

---------10:37----------
and from the transistor that power then

---------10:40----------
goes to the circuit now the whole idea

---------10:41----------
is the fuse access protection however

---------10:43----------
the transistor is going to be what lets

---------10:47----------
the power flow through now the whole

---------10:49----------
idea here with the transistor is that

---------10:51----------
the voltage and the source has to be

---------10:53----------
higher than the voltage on the gate in

---------10:56----------
order for this to actually open so this

---------10:58----------
is a long story short with transistors

---------11:00----------
the way this transistor works is the

---------11:01----------
voltage and the gates got to be lower

---------11:03----------
than the source or else this will not

---------11:04----------
let power through so how are we going to

---------11:06----------
get the voltage on the gate to be lower

---------11:08----------
than the voltage on the source well here

---------11:11----------
we have a voltage divider so we have

---------11:13----------
this voltage divider that's going to

---------11:14----------
take the voltage from this source and

---------11:16----------
place it on the gate and then this

---------11:18----------
second resistor in the voltage divider

---------11:19----------
is going to take the voltage from the

---------11:20----------
gate and bring it to ground but only if

---------11:23----------
the CPU says that it should go to ground

---------11:26----------
so the CPU is going to determine whether

---------11:28----------
this transistor opens now the problem

---------11:30----------
that you saw when I was measuring is

---------11:32----------
that on the source I had 12 volts and on

---------11:35----------
the gate I had 12 volts so if the source

---------11:38----------
is 12 volts and the gate is 12 volts

---------11:40----------
this being a p-channel MOSFET is not

---------11:42----------
going to want to open so there's a

---------11:45----------
couple of things that we could be going

---------11:46----------
on here the MOSFET could have an

---------11:48----------
internal short between the source and

---------11:50----------
the gate so that the

---------11:51----------
that it's never going to open the MOSFET

---------11:53----------
could be broken or the issue could be

---------11:56----------
that this capacitor over here is shorted

---------11:58----------
right so this 147 kiloohm resistor is

---------12:01----------
going to take the voltage and bring it

---------12:02----------
to ground that's gonna lower this to

---------12:04----------
about five or six volts however if this

---------12:06----------
capacitor over here that's sitting

---------12:07----------
between the fuse and the source and the

---------12:10----------
gate is shorted it's broken

---------12:13----------
then this resistor over here instead of

---------12:16----------
it being 301 kilohms it's gonna be the

---------12:18----------
the some of the resistance of the now

---------12:22----------
shorted capacitor and this so there are

---------12:25----------
a number of different things that could

---------12:26----------
be going on here or it could simply be

---------12:28----------
that the CPU is not allowing the voltage

---------12:30----------
divider the CPU is not telling it to

---------12:32----------
hope so the CPU is not opening this

---------12:34----------
meaning that the voltage divider is not

---------12:36----------
gonna work so the way a voltage divider

---------12:37----------
is going to work the voltage divider is

---------12:39----------
going to lower your power or lower your

---------12:43----------
voltage but it's gonna lower your

---------12:44----------
voltage by sending some of it to ground

---------12:45----------
so you have a resistor between 12 volts

---------12:47----------
and where you want 5 volts that's this

---------12:49----------
one over here and then you have a

---------12:51----------
resistor between where you want 5 volts

---------12:52----------
to be in ground so some of your power is

---------12:54----------
gonna go here something's gonna go to

---------12:56----------
ground so if this doesn't have a pair at

---------12:58----------
the ground because this other transistor

---------12:59----------
is not opening then you're kind of

---------13:01----------
 so let's take a look and try to

---------13:03----------
figure out which of these things is the

---------13:05----------
actual issue so I'm going to measure the

---------13:08----------
300 1 kilo ohm resistor and let's see

---------13:11----------
what I get for that so that's supposed

---------13:13----------
to be 301 kilo ohms according to my

---------13:15----------
Microsoft Paint and I get 4 kilohms

---------13:17----------
now again let's just use some logical

---------13:20----------
thinking here let's just use some

---------13:21----------
logical thinking so if my resistance

---------13:24----------
between this points over here if my

---------13:26----------
resistance between let's get a brush and

---------13:29----------
make it a nice color so if my resistance

---------13:31----------
between we're in Moscow hello Mouse

---------13:33----------
there yeah if my resistance between here

---------13:36----------
and here is 3 kilohms instead of 301

---------13:40----------
kilohms

---------13:40----------
what are the potential issues the first

---------13:43----------
one is that my capacitor has shorted so

---------13:46----------
if my capacitor breaks instead of it

---------13:48----------
being 2 plates like this it's gonna be 2

---------13:50----------
plates like this that are touching and

---------13:51----------
then this becomes lower now it could

---------13:55----------
also be that my resistor has been

---------13:57----------
destroyed if my resistor gets destroyed

---------13:59----------
then it could be that my resistance is

---------14:02----------
much lower but that's very unlikely when

---------14:04----------
a capacitor fails it fails but

---------14:05----------
becoming a lower resistance when a

---------14:07----------
resistor fails it usually fails becoming

---------14:09----------
a higher resistance so again this is a

---------14:10----------
ceramic capacitor here so any one of

---------14:12----------
these capacitors where you can see it

---------14:14----------
looks kind of orangey like this that's

---------14:17----------
on these boards it's usually a ceramic

---------14:19----------
capacitor so if this has failed it

---------14:21----------
becomes a short-circuit and it becomes

---------14:23----------
low resistance whereas if this fails I

---------14:26----------
hate not being able to see where this

---------14:28----------
dam cursor is then this usually becomes

---------14:30----------
a higher resistance so I'm not really

---------14:31----------
inclined to blame the resistor now it

---------14:33----------
could also be a failure of the

---------14:34----------
transistor itself if the transistor has

---------14:36----------
failed sort shorts the gate and bam so I

---------14:40----------
could remove the transistor or I could

---------14:42----------
remove the capacitor to try to see which

---------14:43----------
is that faults here so I'm gonna remove

---------14:45----------
the speaker I'm gonna turn on the air

---------14:47----------
filter because I'm pretty sure that as

---------14:49----------
soon as I put any heat on this board I'm

---------14:52----------
gonna smell whatever this person has

---------14:54----------
been eating for dinner for the past five

---------14:55----------
years and dumping into their

---------14:57----------
computer and we'll see which one it is

---------15:00----------
so place your bets do you think it's the

---------15:02----------
capacitor that's bad or the transistor

---------15:05----------
I'm placing my bet on the capacitor

---------15:07----------
because it's very very unlikely that a

---------15:09----------
component as large as that transistor

---------15:12----------
has failed but I can always be wrong so

---------15:19----------
let me go over here

---------15:27----------
the turn the air filter on even with the

---------15:31----------
air filter on I'm not gonna inhale flux

---------15:33----------
fumes but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna

---------15:34----------
smell with whatever this person ate for

---------15:36----------
dinner look at this what is this

---------15:40----------
larvae hey let me get that in focus what

---------15:42----------
is this is a moth gonna pop out of it

---------15:47----------
come on people

---------16:04----------
all right so the capacitor has been

---------16:07----------
removed so at this point I'm going to

---------16:09----------
measure for resistance

---------16:17----------
and see if anything has changed here

---------16:28----------
I still have 3.8 kilohms so at this

---------16:33----------
point I'm gonna remove the transistor my

---------16:36----------
bet was wrong

---------16:38----------


---------16:45----------
can't win them all

---------16:58----------
okay hey sometimes you win sometimes you

---------17:02----------
lose

---------17:02----------
so let's see what I get now 300

---------17:08----------
kilometres one brain in the damn screen

---------17:14----------
because I surely don't have one so the

---------17:16----------
way that what was going on here and god

---------17:19----------
I can't fear we go I can see that now so

---------17:21----------
what was going on here is I removed the

---------17:23----------
capacitor and when I remove the

---------17:24----------
capacitor this resistor was still

---------17:26----------
measuring three kilohms now remember he

---------17:28----------
just because I'm measuring three kilo

---------17:30----------
ohms here does not mean the resistor

---------17:31----------
itself is three kilohms I'm measuring

---------17:33----------
the resistance of everything between

---------17:35----------
this point and this point so there's a

---------17:39----------
capacitor a resistor and a transistor

---------17:41----------
connected there so I removed the

---------17:42----------
capacitor just in case that was what was

---------17:44----------
doing it and it wasn't but when I

---------17:45----------
removed the resistor the resistance

---------17:47----------
between this point and this point went

---------17:49----------
up from three kilohms to three hundred

---------17:51----------
one kilo ohms which means that this

---------17:53----------
transistor was shorted at a short

---------17:55----------
between its source and its gate and

---------17:56----------
that's why I was getting 12 volts on the

---------17:59----------
gate even though this this entire

---------18:02----------
circuit was working so now we're gonna

---------18:03----------
replace the transistor and see what's

---------18:05----------
going on there what do you think of my

---------18:07----------
schematic what do you think of my in

---------18:10----------
schematic I should you know what I

---------18:12----------
should at least write my influences here

---------18:15----------
inspired by

---------18:38----------
it's kind of curious can I actually draw
