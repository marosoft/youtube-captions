---------00:00----------
okay I have 107 slides in 1800 seconds

---------00:05----------
so let's light this candle so there's a

---------00:07----------
perfect storm of good thing in retail

---------00:09----------
I'm gonna talk about retail as it gets

---------00:11----------
technology and then make some

---------00:13----------
predictions and so recommendations so

---------00:15----------
you've had you continue to have supply

---------00:17----------
taken out of the system which is good if

---------00:19----------
you're an incumbent player effectively

---------00:20----------
we've had a kind of a culling of the

---------00:23----------
herd known as retail that was long

---------00:25----------
overdue the week have basically all

---------00:27----------
experienced this opportunistic infection

---------00:29----------
called Amazon and it is clearing out the

---------00:32----------
weak in the elderly in retail so we've

---------00:36----------
had this tightly wound spring known as

---------00:38----------
retail stocks were effectively the

---------00:40----------
narrative until 2017 from all Wall

---------00:42----------
Street analysts was that all retailers

---------00:45----------
were going out of business except one so

---------00:46----------
their stocks have been beaten down badly

---------00:48----------
but rumors of the death of retail have

---------00:51----------
been greatly exaggerated and we've seen

---------00:53----------
an incredible pop in the retailers that

---------00:56----------
have survived and this is some of the

---------00:57----------
year on your stock performance of some

---------01:00----------
iconic names but in general most

---------01:02----------
retailers that have survived are up

---------01:04----------
anywhere between 20 and 50 percent their

---------01:06----------
stocks in the last 12 months

---------01:08----------
you can't talk about retail without

---------01:11----------
talking about the great white shark that

---------01:13----------
is reshaping the business of retail and

---------01:15----------
I would argue our economy and people

---------01:17----------
know Amazon's very successful they know

---------01:20----------
it's very influential but most people

---------01:21----------
really don't understand the scale of the

---------01:24----------
Seattle firm so this is June 17 some

---------01:27----------
enormous retailers who've done really

---------01:28----------
well this is Amazon's market cap on the

---------01:31----------
right so combine market cap and mic

---------01:35----------
Academy Amazon 474

---------01:37----------
let's fast-forward just twelve months

---------01:40----------
let's look at the value that all of

---------01:42----------
these firms added in one year and this

---------01:45----------
is a good year in retail and then let's

---------01:47----------
look at the value that Amazon added to

---------01:49----------
its market capitalization so in a great

---------01:52----------
year for retail they've gone from 304

---------01:54----------
billion to 340 Amazon went from 474 -

---------01:57----------
858 it sits at about 955 today to give

---------02:00----------
you a sense of the value that Amazon is

---------02:04----------
added in the last 52 weeks to its market

---------02:07----------
cap it has added the value of all of

---------02:10----------
these retailers in the last 12 months

---------02:12----------
so while retail

---------02:14----------
coming back and saying hey we're still

---------02:16----------
alive amazon has added the value of all

---------02:19----------
of these firms to its market cap in the

---------02:21----------
last 12 months it's also added the value

---------02:24----------
of all of these firms to its market cap

---------02:26----------
in the last 12 months so take take L

---------02:29----------
brands Adi das American Yugo VF the gap

---------02:32----------
PVH Ralph Lauren fast retailing Urban

---------02:35----------
Outfitters Lululemon Nike TJX and just

---------02:37----------
add that and you have what Amazon isn't

---------02:41----------
have done in the last 12 months add all

---------02:43----------
of these iconic CPG firms again not what

---------02:47----------
Amazon has increased in the last 12

---------02:49----------
months and finally you get the point at

---------02:50----------
every luxury brand in the world and you

---------02:54----------
get what Amazon's added in the last 12

---------02:55----------
months continues to dominate online

---------03:00----------
biggest customer Google is in fact

---------03:02----------
Amazon traffic if it's an indicator

---------03:04----------
shows you just the dominance of online

---------03:06----------
traffic flows as it relates to retail 49

---------03:09----------
percent the most valuable channel in the

---------03:11----------
world the one that attracts the most

---------03:12----------
capitalization or value is not the

---------03:15----------
retail distribution in China it's not

---------03:18----------
even e-commerce in China the channel

---------03:20----------
that vid Garner's the most valuation or

---------03:23----------
stakeholder van't value is ecommerce and

---------03:25----------
one out of two dollars flows through one

---------03:28----------
entity everyone's freaked out about the

---------03:31----------
concentration in telco and says we need

---------03:33----------
to regulate telco because it's so

---------03:36----------
concentrated these are monopolies this

---------03:38----------
is the concentration in telco again this

---------03:42----------
is the concentration in e-commerce this

---------03:44----------
is the concentration in cable this is

---------03:48----------
the concentration in auto and again just

---------03:52----------
to revisit this is the concentration and

---------03:54----------
the most valuable channel in the world

---------03:56----------
u.s. e-commerce so we have a model here

---------04:02----------
and it's China China has also decided to

---------04:05----------
let to let winners kind of run

---------04:06----------
unfettered and we have the same similar

---------04:08----------
type of concentration alibaba's revenue

---------04:11----------
skyrocketing it's great to be the

---------04:14----------
biggest and best in the fastest-growing

---------04:16----------
economy in the world people worry about

---------04:19----------
these companies taking on our Giants I

---------04:21----------
see no evidence of that because distinct

---------04:23----------
of the incredible skill set these

---------04:25----------
companies have the Chinese

---------04:27----------
one problem and that is they cannot

---------04:29----------
build global brands to save their lives

---------04:31----------
I can name any global brand from any

---------04:34----------
top-ten economy except for the second

---------04:36----------
largest economy in the world they are

---------04:38----------
terrible at taking their brands globally

---------04:40----------
I don't think they pose the same threat

---------04:42----------
that people believe now again it's great

---------04:44----------
to be number one in the fastest-growing

---------04:45----------
economy

---------04:46----------
WeChat as a top tune download in 27

---------04:49----------
markets but if I ask you to name a

---------04:51----------
Chinese global brand you're gonna have a

---------04:53----------
difficult time they're just not good at

---------04:55----------
permeating cultural and geographic

---------04:57----------
boundaries that's a skill set the

---------04:58----------
Chinese thus far have have not

---------05:00----------
demonstrated we think of Amazon as a

---------05:03----------
retailer Amazon is about to become one

---------05:05----------
of the largest media companies in the

---------05:06----------
world this is Morgan Stanley's

---------05:07----------
projection of the annual or the 2018

---------05:11----------
revenues when I say revenues is a

---------05:13----------
advertising revenues from Amazon they

---------05:15----------
had it a four and a half billion dollars

---------05:16----------
we track these companies pretty closely

---------05:19----------
this is my prediction for revenues in

---------05:22----------
2018 from Amazon advertising or put

---------05:27----------
another way I believe Amazon will derive

---------05:30----------
almost as much ad revenue as Instagram

---------05:34----------
Twitter and snapchat combined this year

---------05:36----------
we could end up in about two years with

---------05:39----------
a situation where Amazon is one of the

---------05:41----------
five biggest media companies in the

---------05:44----------
world

---------05:44----------
ignore the cloud ignore the retail

---------05:47----------
platform one of the five biggest media

---------05:49----------
companies in the world is a retailer in

---------05:52----------
Seattle now why is that they're better

---------05:55----------
at monetizing their traffic 16% of

---------05:58----------
search volume on Amazon has an ad on it

---------06:02----------
whereas Walmart and Target have only

---------06:04----------
been able to monetize somewhere between

---------06:06----------
one and two percent of the search

---------06:08----------
results so one in six searches you do on

---------06:10----------
Amazon which some people have aptly

---------06:12----------
described as a search engine of the

---------06:14----------
warehouse attached to it one in six of

---------06:16----------
those search query results is sponsored

---------06:18----------
Amazon is so powerful they are beginning

---------06:21----------
to extract and rents from the echo

---------06:22----------
system in the form of Amazon Media Group

---------06:25----------
how do you compete with Amazon and this

---------06:28----------
is the argument I made when I was in

---------06:30----------
Washington on Wednesday meeting with

---------06:32----------
elected officials I think it is

---------06:33----------
impossible to compete with Amazon and

---------06:36----------
I'll talk a little bit what why I

---------06:38----------
believe that is

---------06:43----------
so we have the fastest-growing retailer

---------06:47----------
in the world

---------06:48----------
we now have holidays invented around

---------06:50----------
Amazon to give you a sense of what's

---------06:53----------
happened loosely speaking Amazon is

---------06:55----------
partnered with fanatical investors 300

---------06:58----------
million consumers and some incredible

---------06:59----------
technologists to starch the margin from

---------07:02----------
brands and put other retailers out of

---------07:05----------
business and give them margin back to

---------07:07----------
the consumer and in exchange the

---------07:09----------
investors decided that he or she will

---------07:11----------
accept vision and growth rather than

---------07:15----------
profits and we've never seen that before

---------07:17----------
so pity Walmart who was added who did

---------07:21----------
two and a half trillion dollars in

---------07:22----------
business in the four years between 2013

---------07:24----------
and 2017 and in exchange for that the

---------07:27----------
marketplace rewarded it with an

---------07:28----------
incremental market capitalization of 63

---------07:30----------
billion dollars meanwhile Amazon in

---------07:32----------
those same four years did five hundred

---------07:34----------
eighty four billion dollars in business

---------07:36----------
and the marketplace awarded it with

---------07:38----------
another four hundred million dollars in

---------07:39----------
incremental market cap let's talk about

---------07:41----------
profitability Walmart racked up 70

---------07:44----------
billion dollars in profits during those

---------07:46----------
four years the marketplace again awarded

---------07:49----------
it with an incremental sixty three

---------07:50----------
billion dollars market cap Amazon clocks

---------07:53----------
six billion dollars in profitability

---------07:55----------
during those four years and yet the

---------07:57----------
marketplace decided those profits were

---------07:59----------
worth 406 billion now why is it

---------08:02----------
impossible to compete with Amazon at the

---------08:05----------
end of World War two the Germans had

---------08:07----------
better tanks better guns better morale

---------08:09----------
better officers but the Allies that's

---------08:11----------
cut off their supply routes and we had

---------08:13----------
38 gallons of gasoline for every one

---------08:16----------
gallon they had so we literally

---------08:17----------
overwhelmed the axis force with gasoline

---------08:20----------
and brute force we had shitty tanks we

---------08:22----------
would just surround their tiger tanks on

---------08:24----------
the field and drive around them until

---------08:26----------
they ran out of gasoline

---------08:27----------
we literally overwhelm them with brute

---------08:29----------
force Amazon is the company that shows

---------08:32----------
up to any given sector with 38 gallons

---------08:34----------
of gasoline they can overwhelm every

---------08:37----------
sector with cheap capital that no other

---------08:40----------
business has been afforded to the same

---------08:42----------
extent as the Seattle giant so they can

---------08:44----------
go into media and overnight they can be

---------08:46----------
the second largest spender on original

---------08:48----------
content

---------08:49----------
just behind Netflix who increased its

---------08:51----------
budget four billion dollars when they

---------08:52----------
heard Amazon's footsteps behind it

---------08:54----------
so Amazon a retail company is now the

---------08:57----------
second largest spender on original

---------08:59----------
content in America I believe that

---------09:03----------
perversion I believe our society is

---------09:05----------
effectively going through this very

---------09:07----------
uncomfortable transition that is bad for

---------09:09----------
our youth bad for America and bad for

---------09:11----------
the planet when we no longer worship at

---------09:12----------
the altar of character and kindness we

---------09:14----------
worship at the altar of innovators and

---------09:16----------
billionaires

---------09:16----------
I think this perversion is best typifies

---------09:19----------
by the shitshow I refer to as HQ to

---------09:21----------
where Amazon is gamified the HQ to

---------09:24----------
process and basically created a game

---------09:28----------
which will result in a transfer of

---------09:29----------
wealth from municipalities fire district

---------09:32----------
school districts and police forces to

---------09:34----------
Amazon shareholders I believe it as a

---------09:36----------
ruse I believe they have absolutely no

---------09:38----------
intention of being in any of these 18

---------09:40----------
cities I believe this game was over

---------09:42----------
before it started where will their

---------09:45----------
headquarters be it's very simple if you

---------09:48----------
are the wealthiest man in the world and

---------09:49----------
you're 54 and as someone who's in his

---------09:51----------
50s and it's fairly economically secure

---------09:54----------
obviously not on the same magnitude I

---------09:55----------
can tell you start measuring your life

---------09:57----------
and days and weeks I have 10 more

---------09:59----------
Christmases with my youngest son I have

---------10:01----------
35 more on this planet I don't do pretty

---------10:03----------
much anything I don't want to do anymore

---------10:05----------
so query me this if you're the

---------10:06----------
wealthiest man in the world at a hundred

---------10:08----------
and sixty five billion dollars which

---------10:10----------
means you have more options than anyone

---------10:12----------
else in the world are you going to

---------10:14----------
despite to decide to spend three months

---------10:15----------
a year much less three minutes in

---------10:17----------
Indianapolis let's again talk about

---------10:22----------
human behavior the way you usually go

---------10:24----------
down to the households in terms of

---------10:26----------
what's best for the welfare of the

---------10:27----------
children is dad's an influencer and mom

---------10:30----------
is the decider if you're a mess Bezos

---------10:33----------
again tied for number one is the

---------10:34----------
wealthiest person in the world and you

---------10:36----------
into a rainy Seattle ten months a year

---------10:38----------
are you going to decide that you and

---------10:39----------
your kid should spend more time in

---------10:41----------
Toronto this was over before it started

---------10:45----------
the Bezos have two houses one in New

---------10:47----------
York one in DC the next headquarters

---------10:49----------
will be DC because the only thing in

---------10:51----------
between Amazon and one trillion and to

---------10:53----------
China and market cap is regulation no

---------10:56----------
one is going to regulate the gentleman

---------10:58----------
showing throwing out the first pitch of

---------11:00----------
the 2019 Washington National Seasons

---------11:02----------
which will be Jeffrey Bezos all of this

---------11:04----------
has been a ruse it's been a [ __ ] show

---------11:06----------
and it shows how

---------11:07----------
verted we are at the hands of Technology

---------11:10----------
and quote-unquote innovators good stuff

---------11:18----------
this is all a lie and wasted people's

---------11:21----------
times New Jersey's offering seven

---------11:23----------
billion dollars Amazon will take the

---------11:25----------
most ridiculously insane term sheet give

---------11:27----------
it to the someone in the DC metro area

---------11:29----------
and say match it they will be unable to

---------11:31----------
resist detonating a prosperity bomb in

---------11:33----------
Times Square they will make a stupid

---------11:35----------
deal Amazon is headed to the DC metro

---------11:38----------
area by the way it's going to be super

---------11:40----------
super embarrassing if they pick

---------11:42----------
Indianapolis this afternoon I'm gonna

---------11:49----------
skip through I'm gonna stop piling on in

---------11:50----------
Amazon now what happens when an economy

---------11:53----------
is set up for taxation and it's not set

---------11:56----------
up for Amazon specifically there were

---------11:59----------
two big fissures in the world the first

---------12:00----------
was with Steve Jobs died young the best

---------12:03----------
way to submit your status as an icon is

---------12:05----------
to be outstanding of what you do and die

---------12:07----------
early James Dean and Marilyn Monroe were

---------12:09----------
not that interesting so we have this

---------12:12----------
quote-unquote new Jesus Christ

---------12:14----------
innovation is the religion Apple is the

---------12:16----------
church and Steve Jobs is our Jesus

---------12:18----------
Christ a guy who denied his blood under

---------12:20----------
oath when he was worth a quarter of a

---------12:22----------
billion dollars to get out of child

---------12:24----------
support that is our Jesus Christ

---------12:27----------
now the next vision is Bezos 1997

---------12:32----------
investor letter where he said he was

---------12:33----------
going to focus on truisms of consumer

---------12:35----------
value selection convenience you listen

---------12:38----------
to the guy speak you want to buy stock

---------12:39----------
and we have never had a company become

---------12:41----------
the most valuable company in the world

---------12:42----------
without achieving meaningful

---------12:44----------
profitability which creates real

---------12:46----------
problems for our economy why because

---------12:48----------
since the Great Recession Walmart has

---------12:50----------
paid sixty four billion dollars in

---------12:52----------
corporate income tax and in the same

---------12:54----------
period Amazon has paid one point four

---------12:57----------
billion what does it mean when the most

---------12:58----------
successful in the company in the world

---------13:00----------
doesn't pay taxes it means everyone else

---------13:03----------
who's less successful has to pay more

---------13:05----------
taxes we have institutionalized a

---------13:08----------
regressive corporate tax structure at

---------13:11----------
the hands of our idolatry of innovators

---------13:13----------
in Amazon Alexa is this a good thing

---------13:17----------
this is what the city will come to

---------13:19----------
recognize after doing

---------13:21----------
ridiculous deal with Amazon it'll be the

---------13:23----------
Olympics on steroids

---------13:25----------
a lot of ribbon cutting a lot of

---------13:27----------
high-fiving and then ten twenty years

---------13:28----------
later academics like myself are gonna do

---------13:30----------
the math and go this was stupid the

---------13:34----------
Empire Strikes Back there are some firms

---------13:37----------
landing a counterpunch on Amazon let's

---------13:39----------
talk about those online grocery is about

---------13:42----------
to be the most innovative part of US

---------13:45----------
retail it was asleep for 30 years all of

---------13:47----------
a sudden it's about to become the most

---------13:49----------
interesting place it's the largest

---------13:51----------
consumer market in the world u.s.

---------13:53----------
grocery at 800 billion dollars the

---------13:55----------
majority of the groceries you went into

---------13:57----------
last year you could do a 1985 test where

---------13:59----------
it's so much again with a blindfold took

---------14:01----------
you to the center spun you around took

---------14:02----------
the blindfold off you wouldn't know it

---------14:04----------
wasn't 1985 same shitty brands same bad

---------14:07----------
lighting the same depressed workforce

---------14:09----------
but all of a sudden it's getting real

---------14:12----------
there and they have to be much more

---------14:13----------
innovative because of the Amazon Whole

---------14:16----------
Foods acquisition for inspiration look

---------14:19----------
to other countries that are most similar

---------14:20----------
to US Britain and France in terms of

---------14:23----------
density the most interesting thing in

---------14:24----------
retail is actually a fairly boring thing

---------14:26----------
and it's called click and Collect and

---------14:28----------
it's at the hands of Walmart who is

---------14:30----------
about to become not only the biggest but

---------14:33----------
the best brochure in the world the Net

---------14:34----------
Promoter scores on Walmart grocery are

---------14:37----------
here the in-store experience is here so

---------14:39----------
the easiest way for Walmart to increase

---------14:43----------
their NPS and the perception of their

---------14:45----------
product and service without incremental

---------14:47----------
capex or AM nominal incremental capex is

---------14:50----------
to give people groceries without forcing

---------14:52----------
them to come inside the store in

---------14:53----------
addition about forty to sixty percent of

---------14:56----------
US population can go two to three

---------14:59----------
minutes out of their way to and from

---------15:01----------
work to pick up groceries Walmart is

---------15:03----------
going to redefine convenience it's not

---------15:05----------
that convenient for the majority of

---------15:07----------
America to get home and find a yellow

---------15:08----------
sticky saying we were here and couldn't

---------15:11----------
deliver porch piracy the majority of

---------15:13----------
dual income working home single mothers

---------15:15----------
that's the majority of America they're

---------15:17----------
not set up for last mile delivery and

---------15:20----------
Walmart has figured that out click and

---------15:22----------
Collect is the most exciting thing in

---------15:23----------
retail in my view over the last 12

---------15:25----------
months

---------15:26----------
Walmart purchased Flipkart they overpaid

---------15:28----------
because they had to they could not

---------15:31----------
afford to have Amazon putting out press

---------15:33----------
releases every 24 hours saying we're

---------15:35----------
now the fastest growing e-commerce

---------15:37----------
player and the biggest economy in the

---------15:39----------
world and we're now the fastest growing

---------15:41----------
player in the fastest growing e-commerce

---------15:43----------
market in the world India this was a

---------15:45----------
blocking move they overpaid but it was

---------15:47----------
worth it just as the purchase of jet

---------15:49----------
comm I said 15 months ago was a midlife

---------15:53----------
crisis spending three and a half billion

---------15:55----------
dollars on hair plugs I was wrong it was

---------15:59----------
a smart move because it gave Amazon the

---------16:01----------
ability for four quarters to say we're

---------16:02----------
not growing our e-commerce at six

---------16:04----------
percent we're growing it at sixty Amazon

---------16:06----------
is actually landing counterpunches on

---------16:09----------
the Seattle giant putting out press

---------16:14----------
releases the gestalt of majority of old

---------16:16----------
economy firms is to under promise and

---------16:18----------
over deliver the gestalt of innovators

---------16:21----------
with fanatical investors is to over

---------16:23----------
promise and under deliver how many times

---------16:25----------
is Tesla met a production target anybody

---------16:28----------
here gotten anything recently from a

---------16:29----------
drone these companies Amazon will file a

---------16:33----------
patent for a floating warehouse because

---------16:36----------
they know that the media trolls patents

---------16:39----------
and then writes about it traditional

---------16:41----------
media has been co-opted into being

---------16:42----------
Amazon Amazon and big text outsourced

---------16:45----------
Investor Relations Department why do

---------16:47----------
they not advertise because they don't

---------16:49----------
need to old media is obsessed with them

---------16:51----------
in addition Amazon sees that the Wall

---------16:54----------
Street Journal in Forbes picks up on

---------16:55----------
their floating warehouses some files

---------16:57----------
another patent for defending against

---------17:00----------
projectiles fired at their floating

---------17:01----------
warehouse this is all true you want to

---------17:07----------
understand a company strategy look at

---------17:09----------
its site redesign Amazon has decided to

---------17:11----------
focus on click and Collect and talk

---------17:14----------
about their distribution as opposed to

---------17:16----------
the in-store experience why great

---------17:18----------
groceries cooked at home is a great

---------17:20----------
experience the in-store experience isn't

---------17:22----------
this is genius

---------17:24----------
there are also actually less expensive

---------17:27----------
than all of these firms on a basket test

---------17:30----------
and I think they're going to start going

---------17:32----------
to their roots and talking about this is

---------17:34----------
in fact the best place to buy groceries

---------17:36----------
so some predictions Walmart's and winner

---------17:39----------
in 18 we're gonna see an explosion and

---------17:42----------
the last holdout of e-commerce grocery

---------17:44----------
it's going to inspire an arms race

---------17:47----------
around innovation

---------17:48----------
a traditional brick-and-mortar Amazon's

---------17:50----------
fresh grocery offering is one of the few

---------17:52----------
places they have stumbled and it will

---------17:53----------
continue to underwhelm and this click

---------17:56----------
and Collect from Walmart is going to put

---------17:58----------
a lot of pressure on traditionally

---------18:00----------
somewhat stale large box formats other

---------18:03----------
counterpunch the baton has been handed

---------18:06----------
off this was the most transformative

---------18:09----------
piece of hardware in the history of

---------18:11----------
mankind

---------18:12----------
literally reshuffled trillions of

---------18:14----------
dollars in stakeholder value it has been

---------18:16----------
passed off to the new item that is the

---------18:18----------
most innovative Hardware product of the

---------18:20----------
last ten years that will also reshuffle

---------18:23----------
trillions of dollars in market

---------18:24----------
capitalization and that item is Amazon's

---------18:27----------
echo device and as you can see Amazon is

---------18:32----------
about to pass Apple and value I've been

---------18:35----------
predicting for a long time Amazon would

---------18:37----------
be the first trillion-dollar firm I got

---------18:39----------
it wrong it was Apple Amazon will pass a

---------18:41----------
Pillai believe in the next 60 to 90 days

---------18:43----------
and will never look back so we have a

---------18:49----------
big growing audience here there's

---------18:51----------
signals that voice is incredibly

---------18:52----------
powerful it's adoption rates among the

---------18:54----------
elderly and kids is greater than the

---------18:56----------
general population anyone who asked kids

---------18:58----------
sees how powerful and how natural it is

---------19:01----------
to interact with voice versus a screen

---------19:03----------
what's interesting here is that Google

---------19:06----------
has in fact counterpunched as of last

---------19:08----------
year Amazon had a 70% share of the

---------19:11----------
technology of the future voice and

---------19:12----------
overnight it feels Google has made real

---------19:15----------
inroads and has taken substantial share

---------19:17----------
away from Amazon Google is focused on

---------19:21----------
personalization Amazon focused on

---------19:23----------
commerce it looks like commerce is off

---------19:25----------
to a slow start however I think it's

---------19:27----------
just early this is google's AI around

---------19:33----------
shop

---------19:36----------
the women's haircut for our clients I'm

---------19:38----------
looking for something on May 3rd till I

---------19:41----------
get me one what time are you looking for

---------19:49----------
well is the computer speaking O'Hara we

---------19:52----------
do not have a ball so you get the idea

---------19:55----------
there's some very exciting things about

---------19:56----------
AI unfortunately AI will be used as a

---------19:59----------
whistle call for nationalist

---------20:01----------
fear-mongering to try and stave off the

---------20:04----------
break-up a big tech who have running out

---------20:06----------
of excuses of why they continue to abuse

---------20:08----------
the Commonwealth and they'll start

---------20:09----------
saying but wait if you do anything to us

---------20:12----------
the Chinese are going to take over with

---------20:13----------
ai ai is another overhyped technology in

---------20:17----------
my viewpoint joining the dustbin of

---------20:19----------
virtual reality which is the stupidest

---------20:21----------
technology introduced in the last five

---------20:24----------
years because one of our Jesus Christ

---------20:26----------
said it was going to unlock new worlds

---------20:27----------
Mark Zuckerberg no one's going to put

---------20:29----------
something on their face that acts as a

---------20:31----------
prophylactic that ensures they will

---------20:32----------
never conceive a child 3d printing was

---------20:36----------
supposed to be the future remember 3d

---------20:38----------
printing fast cheap items when you want

---------20:41----------
them great products fast super cheap

---------20:44----------
well guess what Europe and America have

---------20:46----------
this amazing 3d printer and it's called

---------20:49----------
China AI has all the makings of a

---------20:55----------
technology that has been overhyped as

---------20:57----------
far as I can tell ai is someone very

---------20:59----------
intelligent with some interesting

---------21:01----------
technology in front of a smart 25 year

---------21:03----------
old with an excel sheet who understands

---------21:05----------
pivot tables the next big thing in

---------21:09----------
retail Click & Collect has been the

---------21:11----------
biggest thing for the last 24 months

---------21:12----------
it'll be the biggest thing for the next

---------21:14----------
24 months moving beyond that we're going

---------21:16----------
to move to something I would call

---------21:17----------
recurring revenue bundles and this will

---------21:20----------
be where the war is fought if you look

---------21:23----------
at the ultimate gangster moving business

---------21:25----------
number one was the irrational decision

---------21:28----------
by Steve Jobs to take 7 billion dollars

---------21:30----------
out of advertising in 2002 and open 550

---------21:33----------
temples to the brand

---------21:34----------
just as supposedly retail was dying and

---------21:36----------
create a much stronger brand halo that's

---------21:39----------
resulted in a product will buy for 1,100

---------21:41----------
bucks that cost two hundred eighty eight

---------21:43----------
dollars to assemble that literally

---------21:44----------
created eight hundred billion dollars in

---------21:46----------
market capitalization the next gangster

---------21:49----------
moved

---------21:49----------
rated more shareholder value was Amazon

---------21:51----------
Prime to convince consumers to

---------21:53----------
instrument to a recurring revenue

---------21:54----------
relationship being single is expensive

---------21:57----------
and tiring it's a lot of stopping and

---------21:59----------
starting with relationships it's a lot

---------22:01----------
of preening it's a lot of buying clothes

---------22:03----------
you shouldn't be buying it's a lot of

---------22:05----------
spending money on cars that make no

---------22:07----------
sense

---------22:08----------
monogamy is the way you build Economic

---------22:11----------
Security for a household it's also the

---------22:12----------
way you build shareholder value

---------22:14----------
companies that have recurring revenue

---------22:15----------
like software our valued at a multiple

---------22:17----------
of revenues versus transactional

---------22:19----------
companies or retail our valued have been

---------22:21----------
a multiple of EBIT Amazon decided they

---------22:24----------
wanted to be monogamous with two thirds

---------22:26----------
of American households and entered into

---------22:27----------
a recurring revenue relationship and is

---------22:29----------
the only retailer that is valued at a

---------22:31----------
multiple of revenues versus a multiple

---------22:33----------
of EBIT and every company that wants to

---------22:36----------
be a three four eight hundred billion

---------22:38----------
dollar market cap company needs to have

---------22:40----------
their own recurring revenue bundle and

---------22:42----------
if you look at the best performers in

---------22:44----------
the stock market they all have one thing

---------22:45----------
in common they're platforms that have

---------22:47----------
recurring revenue and soon enough they

---------22:50----------
will all start to spend their overvalued

---------22:52----------
stock on trying to create a more complex

---------22:55----------
robust bundle Walmart's trying to do it

---------22:59----------
instacart is a bundle traditional

---------23:01----------
retailers for any of you who own the

---------23:03----------
restoration membercard

---------23:05----------
95% of all transaction volume goes

---------23:08----------
through the Restoration Hardware

---------23:09----------
membership card there's going to be a

---------23:13----------
redefinition as we discuss we're vet

---------23:15----------
where convenience no longer means speed

---------23:17----------
but convenience means getting you the

---------23:19----------
products most easily and with the least

---------23:22----------
friction and the best hope for a company

---------23:25----------
like Walmart is to try to redefine what

---------23:27----------
convenience actually means most people

---------23:28----------
don't have cold storage for grocery

---------23:30----------
delivery most people aren't home between

---------23:32----------
the hours of 9:00 and 5:00 we're gonna

---------23:34----------
move to a series of small operating

---------23:37----------
systems you're gonna have one bundle in

---------23:39----------
healthcare one bundle and apparel one

---------23:43----------
bundle in grocery and the lead dog will

---------23:46----------
roll up a bunch of suppliers and be your

---------23:49----------
interface you will you will manicure

---------23:51----------
your orders through voice but you'll

---------23:53----------
only have three or four similar to what

---------23:56----------
the airline's have done think about how

---------23:57----------
perverse your behavior is once you get

---------23:59----------
really into Delta you fly Air France to

---------24:02----------
Europe because

---------24:03----------
want to get miles on SkyTeam or maybe

---------24:05----------
you're a one world person I think this

---------24:07----------
is where the retail economy is headed

---------24:09----------
people talk about choice consumers want

---------24:12----------
less choice they just want to be more

---------24:13----------
confident in their choices we're moving

---------24:16----------
to a series of a finite numbers of

---------24:18----------
recurring revenue bundles so for example

---------24:22----------
Nike could start a bundle that basically

---------24:25----------
says we buy Equinox you get your knee

---------24:29----------
replaced at a Nike clinic your food if

---------24:32----------
you're into health is delivered by us or

---------24:34----------
partnered with somebody when I spend the

---------24:37----------
last two months of my life for some

---------24:39----------
where I'm gonna check into the Mandarin

---------24:41----------
Oriental Wing at Columbia Presbyterian

---------24:43----------
these brands will start to move into

---------24:46----------
other categories and say we're gonna be

---------24:48----------
the only brand the focus is on this

---------24:50----------
entire area of consumer spending it's

---------24:52----------
going to be all-out war to see who

---------24:54----------
builds the biggest recurring revenue

---------24:56----------
bundles right now we have Amazon in the

---------24:59----------
lead ritalin retail another trend that

---------25:04----------
is these pop-up stores and I'm sure many

---------25:06----------
of you have seen this Museum of Pizza

---------25:09----------
Museum of aigrette ice cream they're

---------25:11----------
basically Instagram with a cash register

---------25:15----------
you're gonna see malls turn to more of a

---------25:17----------
wework model and have to go to shorter

---------25:20----------
and shorter term leases because there's

---------25:21----------
so much inefficiency in long-term leases

---------25:23----------
future retail will be experiential we

---------25:26----------
work model to extend a retail malls will

---------25:28----------
shortened leases or be forced out of

---------25:29----------
business

---------25:30----------
sniper retail picking a specific

---------25:32----------
category I've got to go really fast I'm

---------25:34----------
almost out of time figuring out finding

---------25:37----------
a lazy incumbents razors overpriced way

---------25:40----------
too dominant eyeglasses one company

---------25:43----------
doing seven billion fat and happy jump

---------25:47----------
to Lightspeed God have innovated around

---------25:48----------
distribution product manufacturing all

---------25:51----------
across the supply chain the role model

---------25:53----------
here is probably Warby Parker the future

---------25:56----------
belongs to the fast fast fashion is

---------25:59----------
actually taken more out of the retail

---------26:01----------
ecosystem than Amazon has out of apparel

---------26:04----------
you could the only regression line I can

---------26:06----------
calculate with growth in retail is the

---------26:09----------
agility of their supply chain or simply

---------26:11----------
put the more time you turn your product

---------26:13----------
the more likely your your revenues are

---------26:15----------
going to grow or outpace your

---------26:16----------
competitive

---------26:17----------
here are retailers with fast supply

---------26:19----------
chain and the number of interactions

---------26:21----------
they have on Instagram creating a sense

---------26:24----------
of urgency versus the old guys now

---------26:26----------
agility means a lot of different things

---------26:28----------
it can even mean repackaging or existing

---------26:33----------
products are creating a sense of urgency

---------26:34----------
as ever Lane does when they announce

---------26:36----------
limited edition drops only to their best

---------26:39----------
consumers they make a scent again a

---------26:42----------
sense of scarcity and urgency with a

---------26:44----------
timeline that sells out I went into the

---------26:46----------
Adidas store and Soho yesterday I

---------26:47----------
couldn't find the navy blue Stan Smith I

---------26:49----------
said why not and I said every three

---------26:51----------
months to create the illusion of

---------26:52----------
scarcity they stopped selling this

---------26:53----------
product em Jimmy's doing a decent job of

---------26:58----------
this Nike buy Melrose figuring out the

---------27:00----------
specific limited edition a product that

---------27:01----------
would work in that specific store

---------27:04----------
Kylie jib Kylie Jenner lip kit trends on

---------27:08----------
Google the best and the best and

---------27:10----------
brightest beauty brands track their

---------27:12----------
trends on Google and Instagram and then

---------27:13----------
we Bri package their own products and

---------27:15----------
put it out where Google recognizes those

---------27:18----------
keywords and starts popping it up and

---------27:20----------
pimping it in organic search the world

---------27:23----------
really does belong to the fast not to

---------27:25----------
the big predictions supply chain agility

---------27:29----------
and scarcity value or the keys moving

---------27:30----------
forward fast fashion will disrupt other

---------27:32----------
categories e-commerce profitability will

---------27:35----------
be directly tied to differentiation be a

---------27:37----------
product service or value proposition

---------27:39----------
versus the cheapest price what else

---------27:42----------
what's the next big area of disruption

---------27:44----------
it's easy to pick a sector that's ripe

---------27:46----------
for disruption just look at its pricing

---------27:48----------
relative to inflation the two sectors

---------27:51----------
that have not been disrupted that have

---------27:53----------
the greatest disparity between

---------27:54----------
underlying innovation and price

---------27:55----------
increases are my industry education

---------27:57----------
right each 170 kids every Monday night

---------28:00----------
6,000 bucks a kid 1.2 million 12 nights

---------28:02----------
it's $100,000 in tuition mostly taken on

---------28:06----------
a debt for me and a projector for two

---------28:07----------
hours and 40 minutes my agent takes 97%

---------28:10----------
but it's still unsustainable

---------28:14----------
retail is the other sector I'm sorry

---------28:17----------
healthcare is the other sector we're

---------28:19----------
costs of vastly outpaced inflation

---------28:22----------
you're going to see retail and

---------28:23----------
healthcare meet in the middle

---------28:24----------
you're going to start taking your kids

---------28:26----------
to urgent care not to the emergency room

---------28:29----------
and those little retail pop-ups with the

---------28:32----------
medical logos on them are going to

---------28:33----------
become the fastest-growing part of

---------28:35----------
retail and we're seeing it all across

---------28:37----------
the ecosystem Amazon has become an

---------28:41----------
invasive species that is unhealthy for

---------28:43----------
our economy it can now perform Jedi Mind

---------28:45----------
Tricks it can put out a press release

---------28:46----------
saying it's looking at health care no

---------28:48----------
detail on what that means is it mean

---------28:50----------
they're giving gym memberships does it

---------28:52----------
mean they're creating their own Hospital

---------28:54----------
and the next morning the healthcare

---------28:56----------
sector Peaks thirty 1 billion dollars in

---------28:58----------
between the time they acquired Whole

---------29:00----------
Foods and when they closed on it

---------29:01----------
Kroger the largest pure-play grocer shed

---------29:04----------
a third of its value because amazon had

---------29:05----------
acquired a grocer 1/12 the size of

---------29:08----------
Kroger they buy a hundred million dollar

---------29:09----------
online pharmacy offline pharmacies yet

---------29:12----------
eleven billion dollars the next day the

---------29:14----------
key to competitive markets is that no

---------29:16----------
one entity has too much control in the

---------29:18----------
marketplace and we have let this company

---------29:20----------
go well beyond where Standard Oil Ma

---------29:22----------
Bell or the railroads are but aren't

---------29:25----------
they awesome so we don't have the

---------29:27----------
ability to elect officials who have the

---------29:30----------
testicles descending to actually hold

---------29:32----------
these companies to the same scrutiny and

---------29:34----------
standards we have held every other

---------29:36----------
company over the last hundred years

---------29:39----------
my last two predictions if I were going

---------29:42----------
to write another book called the one it

---------29:44----------
would be about Amazon Amazon is kicking

---------29:47----------
everyone's ass in voice they're kicking

---------29:52----------
serious ass in plain view versus Google

---------29:55----------
they're now the fastest growing media

---------29:57----------
company in the world versus Facebook

---------29:59----------
every year I'd put out 10 predictions

---------30:01----------
and I change the confidence intervals on

---------30:04----------
my predictions Poland will go to the

---------30:05----------
finals of the World Cup as number 10 now

---------30:08----------
they were knocked out in the first round

---------30:10----------
number one is that Jeff Bezos

---------30:13----------
will be throwing out the first pitch of

---------30:15----------
the Washington Nationals game shifted to

---------30:17----------
number two my most confident prediction

---------30:19----------
was x man of the year herb any offs

---------30:22----------
gonna be involved in this conference x

---------30:24----------
2018 Man of the Year will be this

---------30:26----------
individual

---------30:30----------
so a final word

---------30:33----------
I think these firms need to be broken up

---------30:35----------
not because the evil that's [ __ ] not

---------30:37----------
because they destroyed jobs we need job

---------30:38----------
destroyers not because they avoid taxes

---------30:40----------
we need tax avoiders we break them up

---------30:42----------
because the key to competitive markets

---------30:43----------
is capitalism I want you to get rid of

---------30:47----------
the macho test because I've called for

---------30:49----------
the breakup a big tack this is how Fox

---------30:51----------
introduces me I'll go another two

---------30:52----------
minutes and I'm done I go on Fox every

---------30:55----------
Thursday to touch red states I'm one of

---------30:57----------
the people the 89% that voted for

---------30:58----------
Hillary in Manhattan was totally

---------31:00----------
flummoxed by the results so I tried to

---------31:02----------
get out of my shell by going on Fox once

---------31:04----------
a week and this is how they introduced

---------31:06----------
me since I called for the breakup a big

---------31:08----------
tech he's a socialist but we'll have it

---------31:11----------
on the show socially you are a socialist

---------31:13----------
are you not you're an interesting guy

---------31:15----------
because your socialist

---------31:16----------
Stern professor of business Scott

---------31:18----------
Galloway frequent guests on the program

---------31:20----------
and an all-around good guy despite his

---------31:22----------
socialist past this morning Business

---------31:26----------
School professor I've started nine

---------31:27----------
companies hired and fired about 1,700

---------31:30----------
people the only money I've ever made it

---------31:31----------
through options on equity but I'm a

---------31:33----------
socialist in the eyes of Fox put aside

---------31:41----------
the gag reflex about Western values and

---------31:43----------
competitiveness and answer me this I

---------31:44----------
want you to do what Darth Vader urged

---------31:47----------
his son to do imagine the echo system

---------31:48----------
where now Apple Amazon Facebook and

---------31:50----------
Google imagine a second echo system

---------31:52----------
Amazon AWS Amazon Fulfillment Apple

---------31:55----------
iTunes Google YouTube Google Cloud

---------31:59----------
Facebook Instagram whatsapp messenger

---------32:01----------
Apple iTunes which echo system has more

---------32:04----------
jobs a broader tax base more M&A more BC

---------32:08----------
back funding fewer billionaire has been

---------32:10----------
more millionaires search your feelings

---------32:11----------
you know this to be true we don't break

---------32:14----------
a big tech because they're evil we break

---------32:16----------
up big tech because we are capitalists

---------32:19----------
and it is time my name is Scott Galloway

---------32:22----------
teach didn't want you and I appreciate

---------32:23----------
your time

---------32:33----------
I'm Valerie yeah you can see why I

---------32:38----------
picked him as a podcast partner he has

---------32:41----------
some opinions so we're gonna get

---------32:43----------
questions in the audience mostly but I

---------32:45----------
want to sort of what do you think about

---------32:47----------
Amazon by the way I just I love Amazon I

---------32:52----------
use the products I've owned their stock

---------32:54----------
for seven years Amazon is the largest

---------32:56----------
recruiter out of my class they'll hire

---------32:58----------
fourteen students this spring out at 170

---------33:01----------
kids love the firm I think they're great

---------33:03----------
people think they've done a great job

---------33:05----------
but there's a point a natural part of

---------33:07----------
the economic cycle the people at HC and

---------33:09----------
C weren't bad people the people the

---------33:11----------
railroads weren't bad people they may

---------33:13----------
have been bad people we're at a natural

---------33:16----------
point in the economic cycle where the

---------33:18----------
marketplace needs to be oxygenated so

---------33:20----------
how do they do that how is that how does

---------33:21----------
that happen because I don't think it's

---------33:23----------
just Amazon I think there are five there

---------33:24----------
are several semi tractor trucks going

---------33:27----------
down the highway Facebook I would say

---------33:31----------
Facebook Google and Amazon or probably

---------33:32----------
and I don't think Apple is I think

---------33:34----------
there's tougher tougher because it's a

---------33:35----------
lot of yeah so those three sort of run

---------33:40----------
the highway

---------33:40----------
yep and no one can get around them and

---------33:42----------
they don't precisely compete with each

---------33:44----------
other but they're blocking everybody

---------33:46----------
else that can tell each one of them yeah

---------33:48----------
and I feel good so if you believe CNBC

---------33:51----------
or The Wall Street Journal you would

---------33:52----------
think this is this air of innovation but

---------33:54----------
if you look at the data forty years ago

---------33:56----------
there were twice as many new businesses

---------33:57----------
being started as the word of day so the

---------33:59----------
era of innovation was when Jimmy Carter

---------34:01----------
was president because despite some we're

---------34:03----------
very well publicized examples of people

---------34:05----------
like Warby Parker it is very hard to

---------34:07----------
break through and start an e-commerce

---------34:08----------
company impossible to start a search

---------34:10----------
engine Facebook has the technology now

---------34:12----------
that goes out and tracks any app that's

---------34:14----------
getting traction and then incorporates

---------34:15----------
those features into its own apps or puts

---------34:18----------
it out of business imagine the top four

---------34:20----------
retailers Walmart Kroger's CVS and I

---------34:26----------
forget the fourth Home Depot if they

---------34:28----------
woke up every morning and said we need

---------34:29----------
to put number five target out of

---------34:30----------
business

---------34:31----------
how are the people big discounts in

---------34:33----------
those areas that's what's happening in

---------34:34----------
the app world right now because the four

---------34:36----------
largest apps all owned by one company

---------34:38----------
have squared their sides on snap what

---------34:41----------
would regulators do the GOG DOJ needs to

---------34:44----------
file an action it won't come out of DC

---------34:46----------
DC lacks the

---------34:47----------
we'll and the IQ to take on big tech

---------34:50----------
it'll probably come from a red state a

---------34:52----------
red state AG will see that the blue line

---------34:54----------
path to the governor's mansion is to

---------34:56----------
make a populist argument against big

---------34:58----------
text some what happens to tobacco and

---------35:01----------
then the other place where it's really

---------35:02----------
going to get interesting is where all

---------35:04----------
the Wars of the 20th century broke out

---------35:06----------
and that's continental Europe I think

---------35:07----------
Brussels and red states interestingly

---------35:09----------
Trump has attacked Amazon quite a bit on

---------35:11----------
a different level though but I always

---------35:14----------
feel like he has a lizard brain for

---------35:15----------
certain things the president has

---------35:17----------
accidentally inoculated big tech or

---------35:19----------
reduced the likelihood of regulation

---------35:23----------
because his attacks are ham-handed

---------35:25----------
ill-informed and lack grammar so when he

---------35:27----------
says that amazon him as unwashed impose

---------35:30----------
amazon washington post is not paying

---------35:33----------
state taxes actually they happen thanks

---------35:35----------
de path taxes for three years when he

---------35:37----------
tells his DOJ had to go and investigate

---------35:40----------
anti-competitive behavior good for you

---------35:42----------
but then they mess it up and snatch

---------35:44----------
defeat from the jaws of victory by

---------35:46----------
talking about them stifle and

---------35:47----------
conservative voices I mean we've talked

---------35:49----------
about this

---------35:50----------
they don't look left they don't look

---------35:51----------
right they look down oh rage causes more

---------35:54----------
clicks than nice on ads and shareholder

---------35:55----------
value then give them the rage regardless

---------35:57----------
if it comes from the left to the right

---------35:58----------
so I worry that DC and the president are

---------36:02----------
gonna unwittingly create these

---------36:04----------
ham-handed stupid attacks big tech will

---------36:08----------
use data and rational measured arguments

---------36:10----------
to counter those so big tech will act

---------36:12----------
presidential the other is president and

---------36:15----------
which should be a bipartisan effort I

---------36:17----------
think that people love it's not gonna be

---------36:19----------
consumer Lloyd right but the argument

---------36:21----------
that needs to be made is your Instagram

---------36:22----------
isn't going away if you break up

---------36:24----------
Facebook you're still going to get to

---------36:25----------
share your photos as a matter of fact I

---------36:27----------
think there will be more innovation the

---------36:29----------
difference will be advertisers won't be

---------36:31----------
forced to go on to one of two platforms

---------36:34----------
and I would bet you that one of the

---------36:36----------
post-breakup firms with Facebook go

---------36:38----------
guess what I can look you in the eye and

---------36:40----------
guarantee we won't be weaponized by

---------36:42----------
foreign intelligence a division of

---------36:44----------
Russia right now their roots saying

---------36:46----------
there will always be bad actors

---------36:48----------
that's the [ __ ] you get from a

---------36:51----------
monopoly or duopoly

---------36:52----------
the new york times that you're writing

---------36:54----------
for and i was on the board of we could

---------36:56----------
look any advertiser or reader in the eye

---------36:58----------
and say we guarantee you we

---------37:00----------
will not be weaponized by foreign

---------37:03----------
government and they managed to do it

---------37:05----------
with 200 million and free cash flow and

---------37:07----------
yet Facebook can't make that guarantee

---------37:09----------
with 20 billion and free cash flow break

---------37:12----------
that [ __ ] up and you will see a change

---------37:14----------
alright then questions like the audience

---------37:17----------
like oh my god

---------37:18----------
questions come up to the front you know

---------37:21----------
I agree with you on that one

---------37:22----------
good come up to the front what's my

---------37:24----------
favorite part here you want it it's

---------37:26----------
right there so ask question everyone you

---------37:29----------
have to go to the thing sorry everyone

---------37:32----------
go to these things and please ask

---------37:33----------
questions one of my favorite things is I

---------37:35----------
get told all day long by Internet

---------37:37----------
executives how smart they are and then

---------37:39----------
when I start asking about things like

---------37:40----------
Russia and any else they're like you

---------37:42----------
know it's carrots really hard it's

---------37:43----------
really hard so that's always my favorite

---------37:46----------
part hi i'm Shibata I'm at RBC Capital

---------37:49----------
Markets cover internet names question on

---------37:52----------
grocery delivery and Amazon so you think

---------37:55----------
that click and Collect with Walmart is

---------37:57----------
is leading right now in the market and

---------38:00----------
Amazon has partnered or Amazon has 38

---------38:03----------
cities that they do prime now and whole

---------38:05----------
food delivery as well as now they're

---------38:07----------
offering pickup in in store so what do

---------38:11----------
you have to see Amazon do to really be

---------38:14----------
competitive with what Walmart is doing

---------38:17----------
in grocery so I think they're both gonna

---------38:21----------
thrive I don't think it's neither or I

---------38:22----------
think we have our society is bifurcating

---------38:25----------
into Emirates and Southwest and JetBlue

---------38:29----------
Tiffany and H&M and I think on grocery

---------38:33----------
it's going to be Amazon Whole Foods of

---------38:34----------
the high-end and Walmart will serve

---------38:36----------
everybody else

---------38:37----------
I mean we're slowly but surely turning

---------38:40----------
into a nation of 350 million serfs

---------38:42----------
serving three million Lords and if

---------38:44----------
you're doing a good job of serving

---------38:46----------
either of those cohorts you do really

---------38:48----------
well so LVMH kills it

---------38:49----------
Zarah kills it you'd hate to be Sears or

---------38:53----------
JC Penney's in the middle so I don't I

---------38:54----------
think Amazon is having a tough time

---------38:56----------
around the the perishable side of it but

---------38:59----------
I think they'll get there I they the

---------39:00----------
bottom line is when you can invest you

---------39:02----------
when you can reinvest 100 cents on the

---------39:03----------
dollar and everyone else can only invest

---------39:06----------
reinvest 80 or 90 cents in the dollar

---------39:07----------
eventually over time you win what about

---------39:11----------
the experience in the store I know a lot

---------39:12----------
of people

---------39:13----------
it's really become deliveries it feels

---------39:15----------
when you walk in to Whole Foods

---------39:17----------
Whole Foods yeah and a lot of people say

---------39:19----------
this store experience it got a lot worse

---------39:21----------
awful yeah yeah yeah I can't I can't

---------39:26----------
speak to that I'm not a Whole Foods

---------39:27----------
customer did it does feel like they're

---------39:32----------
delivery people say their foods not as

---------39:34----------
good now because Amazon's putting on

---------39:35----------
their massive scale but the experience

---------39:39----------
the experience you'll in the store that

---------39:40----------
you're looking for change no it isn't it

---------39:42----------
just it simply isn't for someone hi

---------39:45----------
there just four miracle you kind of

---------39:47----------
glossed over the future of retail is

---------39:48----------
experiential could you talk more about

---------39:50----------
that

---------39:50----------
sure so while everyone's obsessed with

---------39:52----------
artificial intelligence artificial

---------39:54----------
intelligence when you in a retail

---------39:55----------
boardroom is code for fire people in the

---------39:58----------
store that's what they mean when they

---------40:00----------
talk about artificial intelligence and I

---------40:01----------
think it's a real shame that our

---------40:02----------
technology leaders have trained young

---------40:04----------
technology leaders to be obsessed with

---------40:07----------
figuring out ways to replace people with

---------40:08----------
technology and that's where artificial

---------40:10----------
intelligence is if you look at the

---------40:12----------
retailers who are doing really well Home

---------40:15----------
Depot Sephora Best Buy they all have one

---------40:19----------
thing in common and that is they're

---------40:20----------
making a big investments in technology

---------40:22----------
they're keeping their eye on artificial

---------40:24----------
intelligence but the places they've made

---------40:26----------
big bets the place they're really

---------40:28----------
investing is something called organic

---------40:30----------
intelligence and that is they're

---------40:32----------
spending more on their workers they're

---------40:34----------
saying to quote-unquote best by saying

---------40:36----------
to their blue shirts hey you're a junior

---------40:38----------
college grad you don't have access to

---------40:39----------
Google you don't have the pedigree you

---------40:41----------
can run a fifteen million dollar

---------40:43----------
business called a Best Buy store by the

---------40:44----------
time you're 30 to be making 90 100k a

---------40:47----------
year Home Depot and their gold aprons

---------40:49----------
creating a real sense of community I was

---------40:51----------
just down at Walmart with the CEO he

---------40:53----------
spent two hours meaning a line of people

---------40:56----------
of employees who had been working there

---------40:57----------
for 30 35 40 years Sephora and their

---------41:01----------
cast going to Sephora it's inspiring

---------41:04----------
these are people they find these people

---------41:07----------
who are really passionate about helping

---------41:09----------
a 53 year old look 50 to with a some

---------41:12----------
sort of tea extract on their mouth don't

---------41:14----------
I look fabulous

---------41:14----------
seriously look at me I look fabulous so

---------41:17----------
I think the way to go if you're a

---------41:19----------
retailer is to pivot and invest in

---------41:21----------
organic intelligence not artificial

---------41:23----------
intelligence

---------41:25----------
from the Apple store - I mean it's the

---------41:27----------
Apple Store expand with yeah we should

---------41:29----------
name Angela to this day the people are

---------41:31----------
nice they're friendly they look good

---------41:33----------
they they convince you they like you and

---------41:36----------
they're super interested in yo you've

---------41:38----------
got to do one of two things people no

---------41:40----------
longer go to stores for products that go

---------41:42----------
for people so you better have really

---------41:44----------
think about your people in the store are

---------41:46----------
more important than your products

---------41:47----------
because then get the products online for

---------41:48----------
less all right hey Scott I'm Nelson Wong

---------41:52----------
with the street comm you mentioned that

---------41:54----------
you met with some elected officials

---------41:55----------
recently to talk about some of your

---------41:57----------
ideas I'm wondering what kind of

---------41:58----------
reception you're getting or what kind of

---------42:00----------
traction you're getting for your you

---------42:02----------
know arguments to break these companies

---------42:03----------
up so I've been totally uninvolved in

---------42:08----------
Washington recently and I met with

---------42:10----------
senators Warner from Virginia senator

---------42:12----------
Bennet from Colorado and I met with

---------42:14----------
representative Walden Republican who

---------42:16----------
chairs the House Committee on media and

---------42:18----------
I came away totally inspired they're

---------42:21----------
great I think these people are smart you

---------42:25----------
know senator senator Bennet is a guy who

---------42:27----------
was the school superintendent for Denver

---------42:29----------
got appointed to center seat and he

---------42:30----------
seems obsessed with restoring health the

---------42:32----------
middle class yeah I walked with Senator

---------42:34----------
Warren to the Foreign Intelligence

---------42:35----------
hearing and all he could ask me about

---------42:37----------
was Facebook and what could they do

---------42:39----------
around regulation to ensure we weren't

---------42:41----------
weaponize again I'm not a fan of

---------42:43----------
regulation I think there's unintended

---------42:44----------
consequences so I tried to get them both

---------42:45----------
on to antitrust and then represented

---------42:48----------
Walden who's a hard core right guy a lot

---------42:51----------
of what I was saying about antitrust

---------42:52----------
seemed to resonate these people are

---------42:54----------
sincere they're smart

---------42:56----------
I should never go back because my

---------42:57----------
viewpoint of Washington is really

---------42:59----------
positive right now yeah those were the

---------43:02----------
right people we had a great interview of

---------43:04----------
Senator Warner at code this year which

---------43:05----------
you should listen to if you want to get

---------43:06----------
more last question quickly hi I'm Mary L

---------43:09----------
from pretty oh and I work on the

---------43:10----------
sponsored products business I was most

---------43:13----------
interested in your slides speaking to

---------43:14----------
the sponsored product search results on

---------43:16----------
grocery a lot of smaller grocers but

---------43:18----------
still big in the grocery space Kroger

---------43:20----------
Albertsons Meijer Publix they seem slow

---------43:23----------
to adapt and almost uninterested or

---------43:26----------
uninspired to include sponsored products

---------43:29----------
if you met with them what would you say

---------43:30----------
to kind of convince them

---------43:31----------
monetizing their search results is the

---------43:33----------
way to go since the big guys are doing

---------43:35----------
it money besides when I have to offer

---------43:39----------
that III can't even mature there's a

---------43:42----------
good reason why it's really difficult

---------43:43----------
but Amazon's monetizing 17% of their

---------43:47----------
search results and every other retailers

---------43:48----------
somewhere between zero and one so I'm

---------43:51----------
sure it's difficult but the most

---------43:53----------
powerful retailers in the world are able

---------43:55----------
to extract rents and manufactures brand

---------43:57----------
there's more money spent on shopper

---------43:59----------
marketing that is the endcaps that

---------44:01----------
Budweiser pays additional money for then

---------44:03----------
it spent on advertising so if the online

---------44:06----------
world just wants to mimic the offline

---------44:08----------
world there's a lot of rents that can be

---------44:09----------
extracted from manufacturers brands when

---------44:11----------
you control the interface with a

---------44:12----------
consumer online that was a radically

---------44:15----------
boring answer so real quick I had

---------44:18----------
suggested we're gonna call this this

---------44:21----------
podcast pivot this is what I wanted to

---------44:24----------
call it and you tell me which names are

---------44:26----------
better every time I get I get an email

---------44:29----------
back saying no thanks or next from Kara

---------44:31----------
no I wanted to call it stable genius no

---------44:35----------
no like right frost/nixon no and then

---------44:41----------
finally finally funding secured boom

---------44:46----------
back to you Kara pivot it will be we're

---------44:49----------
starting pivot at the end of this month

---------44:51----------
it'll be Scott and I every week talking

---------44:53----------
about all kinds of issues we welcome all

---------44:54----------
your feedback in terms of probably won't

---------44:56----------
listen to you but nonetheless we will we

---------44:59----------
would love feedback on Twitter and

---------45:00----------
topics we should be talking about and

---------45:02----------
you'll put you in the spot more time

---------45:03----------
what's the next big retail acquisition

---------45:06----------
you did well on the last one the next

---------45:09----------
big retail acquisition putting putting

---------45:12----------
me on the spot you're gonna see it's not

---------45:14----------
retail but you're gonna see a PNG and a

---------45:16----------
Unilever you're gonna see two enormous

---------45:18----------
CPG conglomerates a nestle a PNG Clorox

---------45:23----------
a Unilever merge because the only way to

---------45:25----------
fight back against Amazon is to bulk up

---------45:27----------
all right thank you Scott Galloway

---------45:30----------
everybody
