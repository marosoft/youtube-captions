---------00:00----------
so here we have it says no image and I

---------00:03----------
want to see if it's actually no image no

---------00:05----------
backlight or no CPU so it turns on I

---------00:10----------
could feel that the CPU is getting a

---------00:12----------
little warm so the first thing I want to

---------00:13----------
do is see if the CPU is getting power

---------00:14----------
remember a lot of the times when people

---------00:16----------
say they have no image but they actually

---------00:17----------
mean is that there's no CPU

---------00:19----------
there's no CPU there's no image because

---------00:21----------
there's no CPU but that doesn't mean we

---------00:23----------
should be troubleshooting image that

---------00:24----------
means we need to troubleshoot no CPU so

---------00:26----------
I'm going to go over here and try to

---------00:27----------
find the CPU vcore rail which is PVC CSO

---------00:30----------
CPU and I'm getting one point eight five

---------00:32----------
two volts on CPU v core which means that

---------00:34----------
the CPU is turning on so the next thing

---------00:36----------
that I'm going to want to do is check

---------00:38----------
the LCD connectors here we go LCD

---------00:43----------
connector here now on the LCD connector

---------00:45----------
we're gonna have a bunch of different

---------00:46----------
stuff so first we have backlight

---------00:48----------
but remember backlight comes after image

---------00:50----------
so I'm not going to check backlight

---------00:51----------
first we have an i2c line it's going to

---------00:54----------
be going to the screen we have the image

---------00:56----------
DisplayPort circuit over here which is

---------00:58----------
going to send the image data to the

---------01:01----------
screen also one thing to keep in mind

---------01:02----------
when it comes to defective screen cables

---------01:04----------
this is something that I get asked a lot

---------01:06----------
when you are talking about LVDS which is

---------01:09----------
the old signaling protocol for screens

---------01:10----------
you could have one of the lines be a

---------01:12----------
little intermittent and you would get a

---------01:13----------
funny-looking image with display for it

---------01:16----------
99.99999% of the times and you have an

---------01:18----------
issue on any one of those display signal

---------01:20----------
lines you will get no picture at all so

---------01:23----------
if you're getting kind of a fuzzy image

---------01:24----------
on your screen or an image that kind of

---------01:25----------
goes in and out or anything like that

---------01:26----------
most likely it is not an issue that has

---------01:29----------
anything to do with the cable it's

---------01:31----------
either bad screen or bad board but I

---------01:34----------
just want to destroy your hopes there if

---------01:35----------
you have hopes and dreams of it being a

---------01:37----------
cheap fix during easy fix because it's

---------01:39----------
just the cable I just want to destroy

---------01:40----------
your hopes and dreams right there and

---------01:42----------
you know even back when LVDS was popular

---------01:44----------
it was rarely the cable and now that EVP

---------01:47----------
which is not emotionally disturbed

---------01:49----------
person with what rather means

---------01:50----------
DisplayPort inside of a laptop and now

---------01:53----------
that we're using this protocol mostly

---------01:54----------
it's almost never the cable just wanted

---------01:57----------
the treasure hopes there just in case

---------01:58----------
you had any now the next thing we're

---------02:00----------
going to have that's important here is

---------02:01----------
El is this over here which is going to

---------02:03----------
send 5 volts to our screen circuit so

---------02:06----------
over here we have pp 5 ESO this chip is

---------02:09----------
going to take the 5 volts and send it on

---------02:12----------
to

---------02:13----------
the screen you're going to have a

---------02:15----------
current sensing resistor here so that

---------02:17----------
something can sense how much power the

---------02:18----------
LCD is using and then you have an

---------02:20----------
inductor over here which is going to act

---------02:23----------
with two things a it's going to act as a

---------02:25----------
fuse so if somebody plugs something in

---------02:27----------
and properly it is water it'll blow

---------02:29----------
rather than the computer blowing up and

---------02:30----------
secondly it's also going to slow the

---------02:34----------
initial flow of current because the LCD

---------02:35----------
takes up a lot of current and you don't

---------02:38----------
want to blow the circuit or torture the

---------02:39----------
computer so this slows it down a teeny

---------02:41----------
tiny bit so on pin 28 29 and 30 over

---------02:44----------
here I'm going to measure that and let's

---------02:46----------
see what voltage we get on pin 28 29 30

---------02:49----------
as you can see here we're getting five

---------02:50----------
point one volts which is close enough

---------02:52----------
that's what I expect so the last thing

---------02:54----------
we're going to measure here is backlight

---------02:56----------
because most likely we are getting an

---------02:57----------
image at this point and the Machine is

---------02:59----------
turning on and has a CPU but it just

---------03:01----------
doesn't have a backlight so we're going

---------03:03----------
to measure at the backlight capacitors

---------03:05----------
over here and see what's present so when

---------03:08----------
I measure at those caps we get 0.01 2

---------03:13----------
volts so as you can see here it looks

---------03:15----------
like there was an attempt at cleaning

---------03:16----------
what appears to be some liquid damage

---------03:19----------
right near this chip which what do you

---------03:23----------
know is the backlight ship ok so we're

---------03:27----------
just going to wait for my hot air

---------03:28----------
station to get hot at least this mount

---------03:31----------
is better than just a seasick version ok

---------03:33----------
so that justice mount is annoying

---------03:35----------
because it constantly is moving but how

---------03:37----------
it's much easier to move around the

---------03:39----------
table like in terms of actual workflow

---------03:41----------
see she has this one so she has this so

---------03:44----------
Jessa has the same microscope mount that

---------03:46----------
jason has over here which you probably

---------03:47----------
can't see cuz of the damo but see this

---------03:49----------
like I want you to go out of the way go

---------03:51----------
out of the way I want you to come here

---------03:52----------
it shows up you want to go up this this

---------03:55----------
is beautiful in terms of being able to

---------03:57----------
freely move it around this is awesome

---------03:59----------
the one thing I don't like about this

---------04:01----------
mount obviously is the fact that it's

---------04:02----------
constantly it's constantly jiggling

---------04:05----------
because it's designed to be moved around

---------04:08----------
and because it's designed to be moved

---------04:09----------
around that naturally means that it's

---------04:11----------
going to be sensitive since it's not

---------04:12----------
clamped into anything to those types of

---------04:14----------
desk movements which makes it very

---------04:15----------
frustrating to work with but it is nice

---------04:18----------
to move around the desk or as this one

---------04:20----------
you have to constantly move clamps and

---------04:21----------
should and if it's annoying

---------04:23----------
it's going to be annoying either way

---------04:25----------
it's just a level of annoying how do I

---------04:31----------
subscribe I don't think you can because

---------04:35----------
I'm not a twitch partner twitch have

---------04:37----------
this jealous thing where they won't let

---------04:38----------
you become a partner if you stream to

---------04:40----------
other platforms simultaneously so I

---------04:42----------
never partnered because I don't want

---------04:44----------
yeah no I don't want to sign away my

---------04:47----------
content like that unless I'm making a

---------04:49----------
lot of money if somebody wants me to be

---------04:51----------
exclusive to their platform and they're

---------04:52----------
willing to give me like five or ten

---------04:54----------
thousand bucks a month that's cool but

---------04:56----------
yeah if you're just giving me like sense

---------04:58----------
of ad revenue then no no no no deal no

---------05:04----------
deal

---------05:04----------
no deal okay if you would move you

---------05:14----------
couldn't afford the new place you are

---------05:15----------
moving to right yep pretty much

---------05:17----------
how you doing nitro caster yeah I am

---------05:20----------
saving up to move to a mansion on a

---------05:23----------
Magic Mountain someday I am not saving

---------05:25----------
up to get a better store which will

---------05:27----------
bring the zero new business

---------05:35----------
say goodbye corroded backlight shift it

---------05:40----------
very rarely if ever is the actual

---------05:41----------
backlight shifts you'll see once I

---------05:43----------
replace this it's really going to wind

---------05:44----------
up being something else like the screen

---------05:46----------
so we'll see actually nevermind I take

---------05:49----------
that back

---------05:49----------
I take that back okay so let's see we've

---------05:51----------
got something that's pretty corroded

---------05:52----------
here it's almost never the backlight

---------05:54----------
driver run retinas you guys have noticed

---------05:56----------
it's always the L it's always the LCD

---------05:59----------
connector or something like that it's

---------06:00----------
never the LED driver so this is a rare

---------06:02----------
case so if we look over here you'll see

---------06:04----------
that the line that is corroded is you

---------06:06----------
7,700 pin 11 and if you go over here

---------06:10----------
pin 11 is going to be the pin that

---------06:12----------
allows Q 7700 to open so here we have

---------06:15----------
the backlight fuse and this is going to

---------06:18----------
be 12 point 56 volts from P P bus g3 hot

---------06:21----------
on the back light fuse after the

---------06:23----------
backlight fuse let's just make sure you

---------06:25----------
can see what I've seen good after the

---------06:28----------
backlight fuse you're going to have a

---------06:30----------
current sensing resistor now the idea

---------06:31----------
here is there's going to be a very very

---------06:34----------
tiny drop in voltage across this

---------06:35----------
resistor barely noticeable but the drop

---------06:38----------
in voltage is going to be directly

---------06:39----------
proportional to how much current or how

---------06:41----------
much power the circuit in front of it is

---------06:43----------
using so you 7700 is going to measure

---------06:46----------
the voltage difference between the

---------06:48----------
beginning of this current sensing

---------06:49----------
resistor in the end and use that to

---------06:50----------
determine how much current power the

---------06:53----------
entire circuit is using and if it's

---------06:54----------
using too much it's going to turn it off

---------06:56----------
this is a really nice feature because

---------06:57----------
what this does is it keeps this fuse

---------06:59----------
from blowing it keeps the LCD connector

---------07:01----------
from from burning to pieces if the

---------07:03----------
screen or the screen cable go bad now

---------07:05----------
this over this transistor is controlled

---------07:08----------
by you 7,700 this here is AP channel

---------07:11----------
MOSFET so this is a p-channel MOSFET

---------07:14----------
meaning that in order for this to open

---------07:16----------
in order for this to allow PP vin m so

---------07:17----------
SW LCD backlight to go over to the other

---------07:20----------
side and make its way to the back light

---------07:22----------
circuit in order for this to open the

---------07:24----------
voltage in the gate which is pin 3 needs

---------07:26----------
to be lower than the voltage on pin 4

---------07:27----------
now our 7701 ensures if the voltage on

---------07:31----------
the gate is the same as the voltage on

---------07:33----------
the source at all times meaning that

---------07:34----------
this will never open however if we put a

---------07:36----------
second resistor under it it then becomes

---------07:38----------
a voltage divider if this resistor goes

---------07:40----------
to ground so if this resistor goes to

---------07:42----------
ground now we have two resistors in

---------07:44----------
series and one of them going to ground

---------07:46----------
this will be a voltage divider meaning

---------07:48----------
that what is

---------07:48----------
the middle points over here what's

---------07:50----------
beginning at the second resistor will be

---------07:52----------
a lower voltage than what's at the top

---------07:53----------
however this does not have a path to

---------07:56----------
ground it has a path to use 7700 u 7700

---------07:59----------
will decide whether pin 11 has a path to

---------08:02----------
ground based on the information receives

---------08:04----------
from the current sensing resistor if the

---------08:05----------
current sensing resistor has a huge

---------08:07----------
voltage gap between it it's going to say

---------08:09----------
no we're using way too much power Q 7700

---------08:12----------
close do not allow this to open do not

---------08:14----------
send voltage through our back light

---------08:17----------
circuit and this voltage this here is

---------08:20----------
required to send the voltage from this

---------08:23----------
voltage divider to ground so that this

---------08:25----------
can act as a voltage divider without r7

---------08:27----------
702 having a path to ground

---------08:29----------
r7 708 this resistor may not even even

---------08:32----------
have to be here there's just no point

---------08:33----------
for it

---------08:33----------
r7 701 is going to take the voltage from

---------08:36----------
the source put it on the gate and since

---------08:38----------
the voltage and the source and the gate

---------08:39----------
will be the same q 7700 will never open

---------08:41----------
r7 702 has to have passed the ground in

---------08:44----------
order to lower the voltage at this point

---------08:45----------
which it will get if the SD pin of u

---------08:48----------
7700 goes to ground like it's supposed

---------08:51----------
to when it tells the backlight circuit

---------08:53----------
to turn on but it can't do that because

---------08:54----------
if you look over here you'll notice that

---------08:56----------
that pin is completely corroded so as

---------09:00----------
you can see here the pad for SD is

---------09:02----------
burned and we're going to try to revive

---------09:04----------
that pad without having to run a jumper

---------09:07----------
and it looks like that may be possible

---------09:10----------
here

---------09:14----------
we're going to go around and do that

---------09:25----------
nice I'm going to add some lead solder

---------09:28----------
here since it's going to make it easier

---------09:29----------
to remove the lead-free that's there and

---------09:32----------
then we're going into wick I learned how

---------09:35----------
to wick from Jessa at practical board

---------09:37----------
repair school before starting before

---------09:40----------
going off and starting my own tutoring

---------09:42----------
service at the store Jessa said I really

---------09:44----------
want you to be I want you to be

---------09:46----------
successful with everything you do and

---------09:48----------
for that as a thank you for the time you

---------09:50----------
spend teaching I'm going to show you how

---------09:52----------
I fix every motherboard here at iPad

---------09:53----------
rehab and she told me not to tell

---------09:55----------
anybody that it was a secret but I've

---------09:57----------
decided that I can't leave it as a

---------09:59----------
secret anymore I need to tell all of you

---------10:00----------
and that the secret to justice success

---------10:02----------
has been that she wicks every pad on

---------10:05----------
every BGA I see that she ever replaces

---------10:08----------
even if it doesn't have solder on it

---------10:10----------
already

---------10:11----------
she wicks it for good luck and that

---------10:15----------
genuinely changed my life it changed the

---------10:18----------
way I do business it changed the way I

---------10:20----------
look at board repairs that changed the

---------10:21----------
way I look at my tools it was just it

---------10:23----------
was one of those i opening moments that

---------10:27----------
i will never never ever take for granted

---------10:31----------
and I just I thank her so much for it

---------10:40----------
okay so we're going to clean the area

---------10:44----------
the area is nice and clean the chip that

---------10:49----------
was required was used 7700 which is an

---------10:53----------
LP 8 5 4 8 B 1 sq and if you want it to

---------11:00----------
be able to find a chip like that you

---------11:03----------
didn't know where to go you can check

---------11:06----------
out this website here which I'm going to

---------11:09----------
shamelessly keep promoting here we go is

---------11:12----------
this it

---------11:14----------
b1 sq yeah so you could type in the name

---------11:21----------
of your chip here LP 8 5 4 8 and it'll

---------11:26----------
show up

---------11:34----------
and the cool part if you just want to

---------11:38----------
search by the board so we're on an 8 to

---------11:40----------
0 for 9 to 4 over here you can type that

---------11:43----------
in and it will show you all the chips

---------11:47----------
that are compatible with that model

---------11:48----------
motherboard

---------11:56----------
and you can hit next and it will

---------11:58----------
continue on and on to the next page I am

---------12:02----------
a shill

---------12:03----------
I am a shell and I'm proud of it

---------12:08----------
I will show my website until the day I

---------12:10----------
die

---------12:13----------
so let's pin our pads

---------12:47----------
I'm going to fix that little mess in the

---------12:49----------
bottom left shortly

---------13:17----------
you can see this board really likes to

---------13:19----------
absorb heat if I try to touch the center

---------13:21----------
pad with just the tip of the iron rather

---------13:23----------
than the elbow of it when I say elbow by

---------13:25----------
the way this is the elbow much larger

---------13:28----------
and this is a tip it doesn't allow me to

---------13:32----------
it doesn't allow me much ability to

---------13:36----------
solder the center pad okay so let's get

---------13:40----------
ourselves the chip you know it's funny

---------13:42----------
if I'm actually going to grab it off a

---------13:43----------
donor board because I don't want to dip

---------13:45----------
into my own stock that I'd be selling

---------13:46----------
and that chief yes and we're going to

---------13:50----------
get that nice looking ship started on

---------13:53----------
the board for my beautiful donor

---------14:18----------
there we go now once so I made a dance

---------14:21----------
little just to make sure it's aligned

---------14:22----------
once it's dry I'm going to do and I'm

---------14:24----------
going to push down on it and then heat

---------14:29----------
it up one more time just to make it nice

---------14:30----------
and flat on the board make sure it's

---------14:32----------
making good contact I had some flux

---------14:36----------
before I do that so I don't want it to

---------14:39----------
move from side to side as Ariana would

---------14:40----------
say but I want it to just go straight

---------14:42----------
down see the fact that solder is popping

---------14:46----------
out means that it wasn't perfectly flat

---------14:48----------
which not going to be unless I get a

---------14:51----------
perfect amount of solder on the center

---------14:52----------
pads which I never do so now we're just

---------14:55----------
going to get rid of the excess on the

---------14:57----------
sides and we'll be good now this is

---------15:03----------
where the fine tip comes in handy on

---------15:05----------
this and let's see what we get

---------15:18----------
right up

---------15:23----------
light up you bastard shut up you muffle

---------15:28----------
all right turn on the meter since I

---------15:32----------
think we're not getting a light sad so

---------15:37----------
sad

---------15:40----------
okay we getting vcore you're turning on

---------15:45----------
screen turning on screen is turning on

---------15:49----------
back light turning on back light not

---------15:53----------
turning on all right that's my chip so

---------15:56----------
let's take a look at this area so I want

---------15:58----------
to see if pin four is getting 12 volts

---------16:00----------
that supposed to be the input to the

---------16:02----------
backlight circuit and then I want to see

---------16:03----------
if pin three is getting five or six

---------16:05----------
volts and we check pin four so voltage

---------16:09----------
is a range well okay so it looks like

---------16:14----------
we're getting voltage into our backlight

---------16:16----------
circuit now let now pin three is going

---------16:18----------
to tell us if it's being told to open

---------16:21----------
okay and it's not being told to open so

---------16:25----------
you 7700 is not is either is not pulling

---------16:28----------
this down so we have a couple of options

---------16:30----------
you 7700 is not pulling r7 702 to ground

---------16:33----------
r7 702 is blown or C 7700 is shorted or

---------16:37----------
this is shorted internally which is

---------16:39----------
causing this to always be there even if

---------16:41----------
this is pulling at the ground so let's

---------16:43----------
measure the resistance between tens four

---------16:45----------
and three on Q 7700 so in order to

---------16:47----------
measure resistance I have to unplug

---------16:48----------
power here so we're going to this

---------16:53----------
treating pin 4 and 3 so it's 80 point

---------16:56----------
six kilohms which completely ruins the

---------16:58----------
opportunity that I 7 701 is blown Q 7700

---------17:01----------
is internally shorted or C 7700 being

---------17:03----------
bad now let's measure R 7 702 which is

---------17:07----------
most likely go and see where's our seven

---------17:08----------
702 that's going to be C seven seven on

---------17:16----------
our seven seven or two over here so if

---------17:18----------
this is not blown then this is just

---------17:20----------
going to be a really sad sad case of

---------17:22----------
board repair our seven 702 is 63.4

---------17:28----------
kilohms which is exactly what it's

---------17:29----------
supposed to be now let's see if it's

---------17:31----------
making its way to pin 11 on the IC like

---------17:35----------
it's supposed to

---------17:36----------
point on you know the resistance between

---------17:38----------
this and this is zero so that's making

---------17:44----------
its way to the IC okay so now let's well

---------17:50----------
this is just a portion SMC lid so if

---------17:54----------
it's if the computer thinks it's closed

---------17:55----------
the backlights not going to open so

---------17:57----------
let's check okay turning it on SMC lid

---------18:28----------
to be three point 4 volts if not it's

---------18:30----------
going to think that it's closed and

---------18:32----------
we're going to put it in voltage mode

---------18:36----------
and it's 3.39 which means the computer

---------18:40----------
does not think it's closed so it thinks

---------18:42----------
that the computer is open which means we

---------18:46----------
[Music]

---------18:47----------
use 7700 for you getting voltage of pins

---------18:50----------
5 in pin 18 10-5 and pin 18 you sure are

---------18:56----------
and 10 18 up here

---------19:00----------
five volts exactly like it's supposed to

---------19:02----------
be now we could check our current sense

---------19:04----------
traces perhaps our current sense traces

---------19:07----------
are blown so as you can see the

---------19:10----------
Carrington's resistors are going to

---------19:11----------
attach the pins 9 and 10 here so Karen

---------19:18----------
sends resistor I 7700 which is this

---------19:23----------
let's see what you worry

---------19:25----------
these two traces here so let's turn off

---------19:32----------
power

---------19:33----------
let's check the resistance between the

---------19:35----------
traces do you go to here

---------19:40----------
of course you do and there's the second

---------19:44----------
current sense line over here go to pin 4

---------19:50----------
of course you do ah me and this

---------20:00----------
course goes to you and that of course

---------20:07----------
goes to here f me huh

---------20:14----------
backlight an able on 10 17 backlight

---------20:18----------
enable on pin 17 well backlight enable

---------20:21----------
please stand up

---------20:31----------
backlighted able are it's good to be

---------20:34----------
over here and that 3.3 volts exactly as

---------20:38----------
it's supposed to be pwm keyboard I don't

---------20:41----------
give a about the keyboard ah SDA

---------20:46----------
and STL okay so these are I to see lines

---------20:49----------
where do these go connects to Jerry what

---------20:54----------
Zack from Jerry rigged everything is in

---------20:57----------
the a20 4924 connects to Jerry okay so

---------21:02----------
we need to bother Jerry rig everything

---------21:04----------
somebody get Jerry rig everything on the

---------21:06----------
phone and ask him how I how I fix this

---------21:09----------
piece of computer i 775 where where

---------21:13----------
is this that's 15 16 16 where the hell

---------21:18----------
does this go okay that's going to go

---------21:25----------
okay that's an SDA line to the screen

---------21:28----------
itself

---------21:29----------
that's an i2c line that goes directly to

---------21:32----------
the screen so it has to talk to the

---------21:38----------
screen

---------21:39----------
okay so Jerry is the screen I thought

---------21:44----------
Jerry was a YouTube personality that

---------21:48----------
recorded YouTube videos so I have to

---------21:53----------
measure between here dear god this is

---------21:55----------
annoying so you have to hold the board

---------21:57----------
up like this and do this oh yeah talk

---------22:01----------
about annoying okay so you on this

---------22:04----------
side

---------22:17----------
okay that connects that's fine next is

---------22:19----------
the next resistor I'm just sliding it

---------22:22----------
across the LCD connector telephone

---------22:24----------
counting pins okay so they make they

---------22:27----------
make contact just fine so let's go over

---------22:30----------
what we've done here because this kind

---------22:33----------
of making me set I'm getting defeated by

---------22:36----------
a no backlight I'm glad that there's

---------22:38----------
only 90 people watching this and so this

---------22:42----------
is where nitro caster gets to come in

---------22:43----------
and be a hero and solve it for me

---------22:45----------
there's an upside to having intelligent

---------22:47----------
viewers and I'm going to milk that as

---------22:49----------
long as I can

---------22:51----------
so this is our LED driver section the

---------22:56----------
fuse is fine

---------22:57----------
the current sensing traces attach

---------22:59----------
perfectly to our LED driver the current

---------23:01----------
sense resistor is fine least this

---------23:04----------
transistor was not opening before

---------23:05----------
because the voltage divider that opens

---------23:08----------
the transistor was did not have a path

---------23:11----------
to ground

---------23:11----------
r7 702 did not have a path to ground

---------23:14----------
because you 7700 had a burned pin 11 and

---------23:19----------
the pad was also burned in the board we

---------23:22----------
repealed in replace you 7700 as well as

---------23:24----------
repairing the pad at pen 11 and yet Q

---------23:28----------
7700 still does not open C 7700 is not

---------23:31----------
shorted q 7700 is not shorted internally

---------23:34----------
r7 702 with r7 Sevilla would measure

---------23:38----------
proper values we are getting backlight

---------23:41----------
enable on pin 17 the current sense

---------23:44----------
traces to the current sense resistor are

---------23:46----------
fine and the traces between the

---------23:50----------
backlight s data lines over here to the

---------23:53----------
screen are both perfectly fine the next

---------23:56----------
thing that I have to check which I

---------23:57----------
didn't check are these pull ups over

---------23:58----------
here which I didn't look at but I'm

---------24:02----------
fairly certain that these two pull ups

---------24:04----------
are fine and that 99% chance is just

---------24:07----------
that this this is just being a true oh

---------24:10----------
and we all do not forget we also have 5

---------24:13----------
volts at pins 5 and 18 of the LCD

---------24:16----------
connector and we do not have a short to

---------24:18----------
ground anywhere around this area so you

---------24:22----------
know what may be possible what if I have

---------24:24----------
a short to ground oh oh here's what I

---------24:26----------
didn't check oh here's what I didn't

---------24:28----------
check so after the transistor do we

---------24:30----------
the short to ground because these

---------24:31----------
capacitors go to ground so I checked for

---------24:33----------
a short to ground at output and checking

---------24:36----------
for a short to ground here would not

---------24:37----------
show me if there's a short to ground

---------24:38----------
here because there's a diode there Oh

---------24:40----------
what if this is it what if see 7710 c77

---------24:43----------
11 SC 77 12 are shorted and that's why

---------24:46----------
it's not working ooh all right so let's

---------24:49----------
check the output of cue 7700 I am happy

---------24:52----------
I am excited oh boy oh boy this could be

---------24:56----------
it this could be it and if this isn't it

---------24:59----------
then I'm chucking this board of the wall

---------25:00----------
I mean I'm not checking the sport of the

---------25:02----------
wall because then you'll have to find

---------25:03----------
he'll have to explain it to them I

---------25:05----------
almost got in trouble ok so this is I

---------25:09----------
think it's going to be 77 10 11 or 12

---------25:12----------
and now the reason that we cannot see if

---------25:13----------
that's the problem is because it's

---------25:14----------
hiding behind the diode on this side and

---------25:16----------
the tiny B high-sided transistor which

---------25:18----------
as you can see has a diode inside of it

---------25:20----------
on this side so let's check at l77 10

---------25:22----------
and see if we can blame the coil because

---------25:24----------
as you all know it's always the coil so

---------25:28----------
on pin 1 of the coil do we have a short

---------25:29----------
to ground so we're going to turn the

---------25:31----------
board upside right side up again and

---------25:33----------
that is a funny looking coil I don't

---------25:36----------
even know where to measure on this

---------25:37----------
 coil so we're going to measure

---------25:39----------
on the set instead because it's the same

---------25:41----------
thing to see where is C 7710 actually

---------25:44----------
Cee 7/7 n show me see seven seven ten

---------25:48----------
all right so that is this capacitor

---------25:50----------
we're going to measure on pin one and

---------25:52----------
I'm going to pray that this is shorted

---------25:54----------
to ground because if it's not sure it at

---------25:55----------
the ground and I'm I'm out of ideas with

---------25:58----------
this one until nitro casts their answers

---------26:00----------
to me tweet eight one two oh you piece

---------26:06----------
is shared you're not shorted you're not

---------26:08----------
even close to short it look you mug that

---------26:13----------
you are my hope

---------26:16----------
hi hmm

---------26:20----------
lame so lame so lame

---------26:28----------
sad what haven't I checked I didn't

---------26:31----------
check the 5 volt pull-ups for the data

---------26:33----------
line for i2c but I mean who are we

---------26:34----------
kidding that's gonna be fine that's

---------26:36----------
gonna be fine

---------26:37----------
might as well check them just for that

---------26:38----------
 of it

---------26:41----------
J 8300 that's going to be on pins three

---------26:46----------
and four right and the only corrosion on

---------26:49----------
this entire board was on backlight SD on

---------26:51----------
the LED driver which was totally fixed

---------26:53----------
perhaps i2c doesn't happen because of

---------26:55----------
corroded paths we measured the path

---------26:57----------
between the screen and between the

---------26:59----------
screen connector and the i2c line of the

---------27:01----------
LED driver already of 54.8 and I seven

---------27:16----------
seven five three one side is five the

---------27:22----------
other side is zero and zero okay are

---------27:29----------
seven seven five three are seven seven

---------27:36----------
five three that's the last thing that we

---------27:38----------
didn't check so I checked these

---------27:39----------
resistors and I check to make sure that

---------27:41----------
this signal was making its way from the

---------27:44----------
LED driver to the LCD connector but I

---------27:47----------
seven seven five three over here has

---------27:50----------
zero which means that something is

---------27:52----------
pulling down that line or are seven

---------27:56----------
seven five three is not two points

---------27:58----------
something kilohms huh let's see are you

---------28:02----------
open

---------28:02----------
maybe you're open or kilohms range

---------28:05----------
kilohms range is fine so I'm expecting

---------28:07----------
that resistor to be two kilo ohms and I

---------28:09----------
get one point five which is close enough

---------28:11----------
and on the other one I get yeah same

---------28:13----------
thing alright so now let's check

---------28:15----------
resistance to ground on each side

---------28:19----------
resistance the ground on our seven seven

---------28:23----------
five two on the data line side is three

---------28:27----------
kilo ohms and on the other side is zero

---------28:32----------
ohms that doesn't sound right to me but

---------28:35----------
that's what the screen plugged in huh

---------28:37----------
so what let's see what happens if I

---------28:39----------
unplug the screen because perhaps the

---------28:40----------
screen that I was given is actually a

---------28:42----------
bad screen that would be funny if every

---------28:44----------
screen I've tried today was bad so let

---------28:46----------
me unplug the screen okay so the screen

---------28:49----------
has been unplugged

---------28:54----------
and we're going to do the same thing

---------29:07----------
and we still get 0 ohms like oh that's

---------29:10----------
that's no good that's really bad that's

---------29:12----------
as pretty

---------29:13----------
so what could short my data line to

---------29:15----------
ground like that let's see yeah we have

---------29:21----------
one point 6 ohms the ground without

---------29:22----------
something plugged in well the s the the

---------29:28----------
SCL line now the SEL line is 3 kilometer

---------29:31----------
ground it's the SDA line that's shorted

---------29:33----------
so look SCO line is 3 kilo ohms and the

---------29:35----------
SDA line is shorted but really what

---------29:40----------
gives us a path to ground let's see so I

---------29:42----------
to where does this go

---------29:44----------
so if I click here this goes to this

---------29:47----------
resistor which goes to the back light

---------29:49----------
ship this OH

---------29:51----------
Oh son of a [ __ ] you piece of

---------29:56----------
physical app to ground on that line god

---------30:00----------
really really Apple really you know

---------30:03----------
you're going to put a cap to ground on

---------30:04----------
the line that's that important then not

---------30:06----------
included in the schematic over

---------30:07----------
here are you serious you pricks alright

---------30:10----------
so I to see backlight SDA right over

---------30:14----------
here see this eye to see backlight SDA

---------30:17----------
this line it has a capacitor to

---------30:20----------
ground right over here right over here

---------30:24----------
see eight three five eight and it's tell

---------30:26----------
me you have that on the LCD side you

---------30:28----------
piece of this see 8 3 5 8 see 8 3 5

---------30:36----------
8 ah you pricks you [ __ ] what my ah

---------30:44----------
goddamnit it's over here ok see 8 3 5 8

---------30:48----------
let's find it oh I'm such a

---------30:51----------
smooth brain if this is the problem this

---------30:53----------
is going to be so oh man this is going

---------30:55----------
to be embarrassing this is going to be

---------30:57----------
embarrassing why why don't you put this

---------31:01----------
on the LED driver page where I can

---------31:03----------
easily see it okay so see a 3 5 8 is

---------31:07----------
going to be this thing over here and

---------31:09----------
it's a solder ball coming out of it look

---------31:12----------
at that there's a solder ball coming at

---------31:14----------
you you prick you prick oh man

---------31:21----------
oh man that's bad that's that's bad

---------31:24----------
that's reputation destroying right there

---------31:26----------
that's reputation destroying right there

---------31:28----------
ok so where hello mad it's not on the

---------31:33----------
same side of the board is the LCD

---------31:35----------
connector it's not next to the LED

---------31:36----------
driver it's in the middle of

---------31:38----------
nowhere just like the distance like here

---------31:41----------
what's up [ __ ] get the sucker

---------31:45----------
piece of

---------31:47----------
get the off my board you know what

---------31:51----------
the funny thing is of all the that

---------31:54----------
we checked we didn't check that I

---------31:56----------
checked the resistors in between the LCD

---------32:00----------
driver and the LCD connector but I never

---------32:02----------
checked the pull-up resistors and/or

---------32:04----------
their resistance to ground what a noob

---------32:07----------
mistake that is so noobish that is so

---------32:12----------
incredibly noobish oh that's

---------32:15----------
embarrassing that's embarrassing

---------32:18----------
alright so we're going to plug this in

---------32:20----------
and obviously it's going to work now I'm

---------32:22----------
not putting that kapkan suck it let's

---------32:24----------
see you're not going back on today oh

---------32:30----------
man it's really interesting when it's

---------32:34----------
not in front of your eyes how you just

---------32:36----------
don't see it or think of it they look at

---------32:40----------
of course we're going to get a light now

---------32:43----------
but like when you look at this over here

---------32:45----------
like it's easy to not have this show up

---------32:48----------
in your head let's just see if to the

---------32:50----------
light first before I celebrate

---------32:58----------
wait no what why am i celebrating

---------33:03----------
voltage

---------33:16----------
hmm Oh goddamnit

---------33:25----------
voltage yes still no light screen screen

---------33:38----------
is five backlight is zero okay so we

---------33:43----------
still don't have a light so let's lend

---------33:45----------
us and then let's see if we at least

---------33:49----------
removing a capacitor fixed our

---------33:51----------
resistance issue

---------33:57----------
so if I were to check for resistance to

---------33:59----------
ground can't get excited there so if I

---------34:06----------
were to check for resistance to ground

---------34:07----------
at this the SDA line which was shorted

---------34:16----------
yeah we haven't fixed our problem 1.6

---------34:20----------
ohms of resistance to ground we haven't

---------34:22----------
fixed our problem where else does this

---------34:23----------
go so this goes to LCD connector and

---------34:25----------
that's it it goes to LCD connector this

---------34:34----------
resistor and there so what else could it

---------34:38----------
be what else could be shorting this line

---------34:40----------
to ground what else could it be so we

---------34:43----------
remove the cap we remove the cap the cap

---------34:49----------
is not there and yet we still have a

---------34:51----------
short end this is without display let's

---------34:53----------
just keep in mind that the display is

---------34:54----------
not plugged in right now and that's one

---------34:57----------
point six ohms the ground you're seeing

---------34:58----------
there so I'm going to remove our seven

---------35:01----------
seven five one so that I can see what

---------35:03----------
side the short is on is this short on

---------35:05----------
the LED driver's side or is the short on

---------35:08----------
the screen and the system side so let's

---------35:10----------
remove our seven seven five one to

---------35:13----------
figure that out

---------35:13----------
so our seven seven five one is here

---------35:17----------
let's take that out SCO has no SEL is

---------35:21----------
totally different SEL is three kilohms

---------35:23----------
to ground which is totally acceptable

---------35:29----------
all right so let's remove

---------35:35----------
are seven seven five one

---------35:52----------
this will allow us to determine where

---------35:55----------
the short-circuit is on the board

---------36:10----------
come on hot air station

---------36:23----------
you can do it out air station

---------36:35----------
we're just going to take you and put you

---------36:37----------
aside on top of the fan and that's

---------36:40----------
already gone this the moment that I put

---------36:42----------
it down so let's see which side our

---------36:44----------
short circuit is on on the backlight SDA

---------36:47----------
line is it on the LED driver's side over

---------36:49----------
here or is it on the screen sign over

---------36:51----------
here so on the LED driver's side it's

---------36:58----------
1.5 ohm and on the system side

---------37:02----------
it's 6.7 kilohms which means that the

---------37:06----------
LED driver that I took off a donor board

---------37:08----------
is actually no good

---------37:09----------
most likely so that's actually a bad LED

---------37:12----------
driver okay now this is just starting to

---------37:15----------
get sad

---------37:26----------
is it the soldering and the LED driver

---------37:29----------
that did it

---------37:36----------
maybe it's deciding at the LED driver

---------37:38----------
that did it

---------37:50----------
1.3 ohms okay let's remove this LED

---------37:52----------
driver altogether

---------37:55----------
go away long

---------38:04----------
now that that's been removed let's check

---------38:11----------
not short it's ground okay breathe in

---------38:16----------
breathe out breathe in breathe out

---------38:17----------
breathe in breathe out I'm going to

---------38:24----------
check on a donor and make sure that on

---------38:26----------
the donor board that I'm going to steal

---------38:27----------
this from now that I don't have a short

---------38:29----------
to ground on that pin and say 65 kilo

---------38:35----------
ohms and on my donor the 65 kilo ohms

---------38:39----------
there and open line and 556 kilohms on

---------38:48----------
the SDA line okay let's do this again so

---------38:58----------
I know that on my board that I'm

---------38:59----------
stealing this from that the board that

---------39:03----------
I'm stealing this from has an LED driver

---------39:04----------
that's not short it good to know

---------39:16----------
the cap wasn't bad I blamed the cap for

---------39:18----------
no reason I'm not apologizing to it

---------39:22----------
either if the cap expects an apology

---------39:25----------
it's going to come to the wrong place

---------39:30----------
and I just that wasn't good what I did

---------39:33----------
to the center pad

---------39:56----------
that is a good little filtering cat yeah

---------39:59----------
but well I want to apologize to it I

---------40:01----------
know it's wrong I should apologize to

---------40:03----------
that I'm not in the mood today

---------40:07----------
to apologize to capacity

---------40:18----------
okay

---------40:20----------
that's all

---------40:22----------
that's all you get Center pet okay we're

---------40:30----------
going to remove the chip from the donor

---------40:33----------
take our time removing the chip from the

---------40:35----------
donor

---------40:44----------
you

---------40:52----------
yeah come on stay in place go back where

---------40:56----------
you're supposed to be

---------42:09----------
now let's measure resistance to ground

---------42:11----------
and use fine

---------42:14----------
okay over 20 kilo ohms for SC l-29

---------42:22----------
kilohms for s da so it seems like I just

---------42:25----------
had a bad LED driver the entire time

---------42:27----------
from the donor now let's see what

---------42:30----------
happens if I put my resistor back on

---------42:54----------
come on you lead free melt you lead

---------43:00----------
free you don't want to melt look at

---------43:10----------
the size of the soldering iron I'm using

---------43:12----------
for a zero to zero one component if this

---------43:14----------
is not the definition of being an idiot

---------43:16----------
I don't know what is all right come on

---------43:20----------
you lead free but cut my resistor

---------43:22----------
in there and all of the patience to

---------43:24----------
change my iron right now just melt come

---------43:29----------
on

---------43:36----------
there you go that my resistor and you

---------43:39----------
 okay

---------43:50----------
now it's interesting is that cat I

---------43:52----------
wonder if that cap having a solder ball

---------43:53----------
there was actually sure I wonder if if

---------43:55----------
you short that line to ground if it

---------43:57----------
actually killed the LED driver because

---------43:59----------
that's the only thing I can imagine

---------44:00----------
because even after I removed it my short

---------44:01----------
was still there and that cap that little

---------44:03----------
filter cap that then had a solder blob

---------44:05----------
next to it so I'm not going to say that

---------44:07----------
that cap is come totally innocent here

---------44:15----------
that cat may have been killing my LED

---------44:17----------
drivers all right let's see what we get

---------44:25----------
huh a backlight finally a light on the

---------44:31----------
screen okay so so what did we learn here

---------44:37----------
that what what did you learn from all

---------44:41----------
this that bad LED driver can make your

---------44:45----------
life a complete living hell

---------44:49----------
and as adjusted for the last hours so

---------44:53----------
for me as well as the cap so the cap was

---------44:57----------
probably killing all the LED drivers

---------44:58----------
that I was putting on so if you short

---------45:00----------
that line of ground maybe it can kill

---------45:02----------
the LED driver that's the only thing I

---------45:04----------
can imagine at this point that's really
