---------00:03----------
Annelle is doing better he did some

---------00:06----------
walking today for the first time in a

---------00:07----------
while so I imagine he's getting better

---------00:09----------
since he's able to walk he was having

---------00:12----------
issues walking before do you have a

---------00:14----------
sticker possible time sticker Daxing in

---------00:17----------
Ella's room on your shirt

---------00:18----------
 today we are going to get started

---------00:22----------
on fixing another dead MacBook so here

---------00:27----------
we have an a 1502 with no power it has a

---------00:30----------
little reddit sticker on it which i

---------00:32----------
think is kind of cool look at that

---------00:33----------
little red it's sticker so we are going

---------00:36----------
to open this thing up try to not knock

---------00:39----------
everything off my desk

---------00:40----------
and see what's wrong with it yeah so

---------00:43----------
Annelle is doing better

---------00:45----------
he walked to take a today today is

---------00:48----------
the first day that he was able to walk

---------00:49----------
to the bathroom and take his own

---------00:51----------
since he got hit by and then run over by

---------00:54----------
a truck on on Saturday night so I'm

---------00:59----------
happy with I'm proud of him that he was

---------01:02----------
able to do that so it looks like this

---------01:03----------
MacBook is not giving us a green light

---------01:05----------
in the charger and if we look at the

---------01:08----------
power draw it's using 24 milliamps now

---------01:11----------
24 millimeters interesting that's

---------01:12----------
typically that's usually indicative of a

---------01:13----------
missing p.m. sleep s4l but the no green

---------01:16----------
light is even more interesting so we got

---------01:20----------
to figure out why there's no green light

---------01:21----------
which means we have to check TP 3 before

---------01:22----------
200 square G 3 huh as I mentioned in

---------01:25----------
countless videos at this point and

---------01:26----------
you're welcome to check out any of my

---------01:28----------
videos in the 1 wire circuit or the why

---------01:29----------
is there no green light playlist on

---------01:32----------
boards rossmann group comm DB 342 is a

---------01:35----------
power rail that is going to be required

---------01:37----------
to power the circuitry on the board that

---------01:39----------
allows the charger to speak to the

---------01:41----------
computer d70 50 was fake news you 70 100

---------01:44----------
was the real deal this is William

---------01:45----------
well I'm glad you figured out your

---------01:46----------
problem thank you very much for the $2

---------01:49----------
it is highly appreciated if you take a

---------01:51----------
look at what we have on the desk this is

---------01:53----------
really cool I got the zoom lens recently

---------01:54----------
and it lets me do stuff like this which

---------01:56----------
is awesome only my desk actually had the

---------01:58----------
space to do zoom so if you take a look

---------02:00----------
there is a bit of a hand as to what went

---------02:03----------
on here so what's the hint well the

---------02:05----------
board sits in the machine like this

---------02:06----------
right so I flip it over and you have

---------02:10----------
this this is a burn mark right through

---------02:12----------
the keyboard backlight

---------02:13----------
so and then over here you have a diode

---------02:16----------
that looks blown that is weird

---------02:22----------
particularly since one of the people

---------02:24----------
just commented at the beginning of the

---------02:25----------
show saying it wasn't to the diode it

---------02:28----------
was the you 7100 but they I believe they

---------02:30----------
stated the number of the diode that died

---------02:32----------
in this macbook before I opened it so

---------02:34----------
that is incredibly creepy man I don't

---------02:37----------
know how the hell you were able to do

---------02:38----------
that get out of my head

---------02:40----------
get out of my store get out of my

---------02:41----------
incoming slots anyway so before we even

---------02:43----------
get started like turning on our brain

---------02:45----------
one of the things I talk about a lot is

---------02:47----------
that before I enter brain mode I like to

---------02:50----------
just stay in brain feom brain off mode

---------02:54----------
and the reason is that doing this job

---------02:57----------
and trying to figure out some of the

---------02:58----------
more complex and complicated problems

---------03:01----------
and patterns is going to burn your brain

---------03:03----------
so you want to save your brain for the

---------03:05----------
things that require your brain and over

---------03:06----------
here look at that look at that let's

---------03:09----------
take a look and see what that does

---------03:10----------
let's open look at it under the

---------03:11----------
microscope and then confirm which

---------03:13----------
components those are and then look at

---------03:15----------
the schematic and the board view before

---------03:18----------
we drive ourselves crazy using our brain

---------03:21----------
when we don't actually need to use our

---------03:22----------
brain so we switched over to the

---------03:24----------
microscope camera and that is one burned

---------03:26----------
looking diode I mean damn people look at

---------03:29----------
that thing I mean it's it's not just

---------03:32----------
burn but it's it has blown up if you

---------03:34----------
look at it it's essentially it's

---------03:37----------
exploded it looks like it's exploding

---------03:38----------
upwards me just get my camera in proper

---------03:41----------
focus look at that it's gonna be blowing

---------03:43----------
up across the book off the board

---------03:45----------
it's bloated it's bloated as me as I am

---------03:49----------
after eating 2 or 3 burritos in a day

---------03:52----------
friends in forever

---------03:53----------
indeed I love my kitty mister Clinton

---------03:55----------
Clinton forever

---------03:57----------
look at this it's crumbling to pieces

---------04:00----------
this is crumbling to bits and pieces

---------04:02----------
like any chances of Karen earning a

---------04:05----------
commission off of me leasing a new store

---------04:08----------
this crumbling to bits and pieces so

---------04:11----------
let's see what that diode is for and

---------04:13----------
let's try and figure out what could have

---------04:15----------
happened that would cause this diode to

---------04:17----------
explode and blow up in such a violent

---------04:19----------
fashion now if you go back to the

---------04:21----------
schematic in the board view over here

---------04:23----------
using paul daniels of software you'll

---------04:25----------
see that's a deist

---------04:26----------
seven 105 and if we take a look on the

---------04:29----------
schematic part of the screen

---------04:32----------
d7 105 sits between PPD CNG three hot

---------04:37----------
this is the power coming directly from

---------04:39----------
the charger and the u 7100 chip now the

---------04:44----------
only way for this to blow up in such a

---------04:46----------
terrible fashion would be if there was a

---------04:49----------
short to ground in front of it cuz keep

---------04:51----------
in mind heat it's gonna blow up because

---------04:53----------
there's a lot of heat or EO for office

---------04:54----------
count 2020 we will think about it

---------04:56----------
thank you very much JP if you have a

---------04:58----------
component that blows up that means most

---------05:00----------
likely too much power went through too

---------05:01----------
much energy so how is that gonna happen

---------05:03----------
well you're gonna have to have a very

---------05:05----------
low is it since the ground on the other

---------05:06----------
side so that all the power has someplace

---------05:08----------
to go

---------05:08----------
so mote and now here if you take a look

---------05:10----------
at that schematic the only path to

---------05:12----------
ground after this after this diode over

---------05:15----------
here is our u 7100 chip so I'm gonna

---------05:19----------
take a guess that if I were to measure

---------05:20----------
with the meter our 71005 blue but it

---------05:25----------
didn't blow fast enough and that if I

---------05:28----------
were to check over here on the other

---------05:29----------
side of this resistor this right over

---------05:31----------
here would be short it's a ground so

---------05:33----------
let's take a look at what our our 71005

---------05:35----------
is so I believe that if I check on pin

---------05:37----------
to that I'm gonna see a short to ground

---------05:39----------
so now I'm gonna turn on another piece

---------05:41----------
of Paul Daniels software and which is

---------05:44----------
the multimeter software from Paul

---------05:47----------
Daniels PL Daniel's comm Australian

---------05:53----------
software all those crazy places in the

---------05:57----------
world will they say things like solder

---------05:59----------
with an L and loonatics savages absolute

---------06:05----------
savages they say solder with an L and

---------06:07----------
alluminium yeah so we do this

---------06:13----------
and it looks like Paulding just whoops

---------06:16----------
my hand slipped and I made a scratch

---------06:18----------
I'm sorry sorry sorry please don't hate

---------06:26----------
me now over here we have a short to

---------06:30----------
ground 44 ohms now that's not a zero ohm

---------06:33----------
short but do keep in mind that's 44 ohms

---------06:35----------
at eighteen point five volts this is not

---------06:37----------
a low-voltage power line that is

---------06:39----------
eighteen point five volts so how many

---------06:41----------
volts how many - how many amps would

---------06:43----------
this have been asking so if we look at

---------06:44----------
the Ohm's law calculator my hands are a

---------06:47----------
bit shaky today so I probably should

---------06:49----------
have stayed home there is a reason I do

---------06:54----------
less board repair nowadays eighteen

---------06:56----------
point five volts resistance of 44 ohms

---------06:59----------
that says that that's gonna ask for

---------07:02----------
seven watts of power to go through now

---------07:04----------
I'm guessing that that's a little too

---------07:05----------
much for that diode so if we were to go

---------07:07----------
back to the schematic and the board view

---------07:13----------
this is rated for this little resistor

---------07:16----------
is rated for one sixteenth of a watt and

---------07:20----------
Majan that the diode over here is also

---------07:22----------
probably rated for something less than

---------07:23----------
that around there so instead of putting

---------07:26----------
one sixteenth of a walk through this

---------07:28----------
circuit we were drawing seven watts

---------07:30----------
which is considerably more so that's 16

---------07:34----------
times seven carry the hundred - math

---------07:41----------
let's see going through that circuit was

---------07:44----------
approximately a hundred twenty times the

---------07:46----------
amount of power that's supposed to be

---------07:48----------
going through that circuit and when you

---------07:50----------
put 123 times as much power as you're

---------07:52----------
supposed to put the wrist circuit what

---------07:54----------
happens is it winds up looking like this

---------07:56----------
so we're gonna do is I'm gonna replace

---------07:59----------
this you 7100 chip which you should be

---------08:02----------
able to get on store dot rossmann group

---------08:04----------
comm it's an ISL six two five nine

---------08:05----------
aah art easy not to be confused with an

---------08:08----------
ISL six two five eight because remember

---------08:11----------
if we simply replace the chip that looks

---------08:13----------
bad which is this diode we're not

---------08:14----------
solving a problem that diode blew for a

---------08:16----------
reason and you need to figure it out

---------08:18----------
that is a just barely brain on moment

---------08:21----------
have you seen that the EU just passed

---------08:23----------
the new rights repair losing in to

---------08:24----------
repair shops on individuals

---------08:25----------
highlight his access to the documents in

---------08:27----------
supply of cars for 10-year production

---------08:28----------
stop I haven't seen it it depends on how

---------08:31----------
they award it because if it's worded we

---------08:33----------
will give you access to the same

---------08:35----------
documents that our authorized providers

---------08:37----------
have that doesn't actually do anything

---------08:39----------
it doesn't change anything and it's

---------08:42----------
useless to me because one of the things

---------08:43----------
that I demonstrated time and time again

---------08:45----------
on this video that I did titled what do

---------08:47----------
Apple authorized service providers do

---------08:49----------
let me to see if I can find that up here

---------08:52----------
what does authorized repair do let's

---------08:53----------
find out in that video I call a bunch of

---------08:55----------
authorized repair centers and what you

---------08:56----------
can understand after you listen to that

---------08:58----------
video is that most authorized repair

---------09:00----------
centers don't get any useful

---------09:02----------
documentation don't get access to any

---------09:04----------
parts most of them are essentially

---------09:05----------
glorified mailing facilities that mail

---------09:07----------
it to a centralized Depot that then does

---------09:09----------
the actual work I don't want access to

---------09:11----------
the documentation that Mike's tech shop

---------09:13----------
has I don't want access to the

---------09:15----------
documentation that tekserve had I want

---------09:17----------
access to the that the the people

---------09:20----------
refer being the motherboards in your

---------09:22----------
Chinese or whatever location where

---------09:24----------
they're actually refer being boards for

---------09:25----------
people have I want their documentation I

---------09:28----------
don't want this facade fashioned you

---------09:31----------
know whatever I don't want the junk

---------09:33----------
because if you're giving me the

---------09:35----------
documentation that the for example let's

---------09:37----------
say you liquid damage this MacBook let's

---------09:40----------
say let's say it stops working or it

---------09:42----------
just dies this is gonna get sent to a

---------09:43----------
facility where Apple will actually

---------09:45----------
refurbish it they will refurbish this or

---------09:47----------
when it came to the 2011's with the

---------09:49----------
dying GPUs they actually would send

---------09:51----------
those boards under the recall program to

---------09:53----------
a facility that had something like a

---------09:54----------
Zama some sort of rework BGA rework

---------09:57----------
station

---------09:58----------
I want the documents that they get

---------10:00----------
access to I don't want to get the

---------10:01----------
documents that you're pathetic AAA ESPYs

---------10:04----------
get access to that aren't even allowed

---------10:06----------
to change the charge port on a cell

---------10:07----------
phone no I'm not okay with those

---------10:10----------
documents and the thing that I think is

---------10:11----------
gonna happen and the reason that again

---------10:13----------
I'm not pushing for legal changes so

---------10:16----------
much anymore as I'm pushing for cultural

---------10:18----------
changes is that what they're gonna do to

---------10:20----------
satisfy that type of law is they're

---------10:22----------
gonna say well look we gave them access

---------10:24----------
to the tools the same garbage prices in

---------10:26----------
the same garbage pathetic documentation

---------10:28----------
that we give our normal authorized

---------10:30----------
service for certain centers that don't

---------10:31----------
really do any repair anyway we're done

---------10:33----------
if that's the case then no I want the

---------10:36----------
other stuff and again I don't think that

---------10:38----------
the legal route

---------10:39----------
is the route that's actually going to

---------10:40----------
work to get there because you're

---------10:42----------
constantly fighting you're constantly

---------10:44----------
fighting they're gonna come up with the

---------10:45----------
law then they're gonna come up with a

---------10:47----------
way to get around that law like by

---------10:48----------
probably saying that you know you you're

---------10:50----------
asking for access to what are we

---------10:52----------
provider service providers on the world

---------10:54----------
we'll just make sure our service

---------10:55----------
providers can't do so then if you

---------10:57----------
get their documentation doesn't effing

---------10:58----------
matter what matters to me and I think it

---------11:00----------
will actually create long-term change is

---------11:02----------
not holding up a sign is not demanding

---------11:05----------
legislation but rather cultural changes

---------11:08----------
so if we get to a point where the new

---------11:09----------
engineers and the new designers and the

---------11:11----------
new business managers are the new

---------11:14----------
supervisors or the new members of the

---------11:16----------
board at Apple and other companies like

---------11:18----------
Apple actually won't see the value in

---------11:21----------
what we do because those are the people

---------11:22----------
that grew up watching me do this stuff

---------11:25----------
they were you know sitting in their

---------11:26----------
boring class where their teacher was

---------11:28----------
telling to memorize a bunch of dates and

---------11:30----------
they had their little headphone stuck in

---------11:32----------
I wouldn't do it Bush but you know they

---------11:36----------
had their little headphone hiding in

---------11:37----------
their ear and they're listening to me

---------11:39----------
fix a board and they're saying wow

---------11:41----------
that's cool this is fun I can't wait to

---------11:42----------
figure out what it actually is or

---------11:43----------
something like that the people that grew

---------11:45----------
up watching the stuff that think it's

---------11:46----------
interesting and cool when they enter

---------11:48----------
management positions where they enter

---------11:49----------
positions on the board when they enter

---------11:51----------
you know positions in engineering

---------11:54----------
they're not gonna want to work at a

---------11:55----------
company that does like that and

---------11:57----------
they're not gonna want to be that type

---------11:58----------
of company so what I don't want to try

---------12:00----------
and force them to do something they

---------12:02----------
don't want to do I want to try and

---------12:04----------
change the perception and change the

---------12:06----------
culture to the point where the people

---------12:08----------
that work there actually want this me to

---------12:11----------
have the things that I want not where

---------12:13----------
I'm trying to twist a hand because

---------12:14----------
that's never gonna work yeah I'm gonna

---------12:15----------
twist their arm they're gonna twist back

---------12:17----------
I'm gonna twist they're gonna twist back

---------12:19----------
I don't see the legal solution getting

---------12:20----------
anywhere I mean I have right for a pair

---------12:22----------
is something that we've been advocating

---------12:23----------
for for like four and a half five

---------12:24----------
probably longer years I mean can I go to

---------12:28----------
a website and get a schematic yet you

---------12:30----------
know what I'm saying like I just I don't

---------12:32----------
know maybe I'm just being one second my

---------12:36----------
broker is calling me

---------12:40----------
hello Alan Louis how are you doing well

---------12:46----------
it's a lot more humid or less technical

---------12:51----------
they're not looking anything super to

---------12:53----------
anything too academic it is very very

---------12:55----------
practical and it's me as a personality

---------12:58----------
center table they're looking for

---------12:59----------
entertainment as much as information

---------13:02----------
yeah again the whole idea is you just

---------13:04----------
give them what they want people keep

---------13:06----------
showing up and keep you know keep coming

---------13:07----------
and someday if you got 100 K or 200 K or

---------13:10----------
500 K I don't know you get up but the

---------13:12----------
thing is this actually there's an

---------13:14----------
excellent blog that I suggest you read

---------13:16----------
from Scott Adams it's about his

---------13:18----------
girlfriend Christina bash Sherman how

---------13:20----------
she doesn't actually have any specific

---------13:22----------
job or goal she just intentionally keeps

---------13:25----------
trying to expand her followers and as it

---------13:27----------
happens she keeps getting these

---------13:29----------
interesting offers for things that she

---------13:31----------
and at some point they started to become

---------13:32----------
interesting it's a interest it's the guy

---------13:35----------
that's the guy that made Dilbert it but

---------13:36----------
it's an interesting piece yes Scott

---------13:40----------
Adams he talks about something called

---------13:42----------
talent slack he actually wrote a whole

---------13:44----------
book on it but he has a blog post on it

---------13:49----------
Scott Adams and the topic is called

---------13:52----------
talents slack I was actually gonna you

---------14:08----------
beat me to getting you a mic I was gonna

---------14:09----------
get you drop something off at your

---------14:11----------
office when I had time it has happened I

---------14:13----------
have a mic that I plug into my phone I

---------14:15----------
think you saw it's like 60 or 70 bucks

---------14:16----------
to that Arama so there's a mic by a

---------14:19----------
company called Road ro de and it's very

---------14:21----------
good it's the one that I use for all my

---------14:23----------
stuff it just plugs into the charging

---------14:25----------
port of your iPhone on the bottom of it

---------14:27----------
and then when you hold your phone and

---------14:29----------
show the space you just have the

---------14:30----------
microphone pointing at you it's way

---------14:31----------
better than the crap that's built into

---------14:32----------
the phone I draw more bnh I don't know

---------14:40----------
if that's by is gonna have it

---------14:45----------
okay terrific Luis thank you so much and

---------14:50----------
I will thank you so much for remembering

---------14:53----------
I appreciate it Alan and just like

---------14:55----------
hopefully he can solve this

---------14:56----------
air-conditioning thing soon so we get a

---------14:57----------
lease and get started

---------15:05----------
yeah yeah thank you so much I appreciate

---------15:08----------
all right yeah they didn't calculate

---------15:12----------
what size a/c unit I need so there they

---------15:14----------
wanted to speak with a contractor but in

---------15:16----------
order to have a contractor I need to

---------15:17----------
have an architect and in order to have

---------15:19----------
an architect the architect needs to make

---------15:20----------
a plan and the architect needs to get in

---------15:22----------
there to make a plan but to get in to

---------15:23----------
get a plan I have to have keys but to

---------15:24----------
have keys I need a lease but to get a

---------15:26----------
lease I need to know what a/c I need to

---------15:28----------
know what a/c I needed need to speak to

---------15:29----------
a contractor to speak to the contract or

---------15:31----------
I need to have an architect and it's

---------15:33----------
let's see Scott Adams is a trump shill

---------15:35----------
oh this Oh goddamn yeah so Scott Adams

---------15:38----------
being a Trump show I mean the thing that

---------15:39----------
you're missing here if somebody has

---------15:41----------
advice that's actually useful advice on

---------15:43----------
your business are you going to ignore it

---------15:45----------
because they like a politician you don't

---------15:47----------
like if somebody wrote a book and that

---------15:48----------
book was very helpful on business and

---------15:51----------
taught me a lot that I that would help

---------15:53----------
me in my life but that person endorsed

---------15:55----------
Hillary Clinton or AOC or George Bush or

---------16:00----------
somebody that I don't like I'm not going

---------16:03----------
to ignore the section that is useful

---------16:05----------
because they disagree with me on

---------16:08----------
something else I will accept the section

---------16:10----------
that is useful to my life and then not

---------16:12----------
accept the section that is not useful to

---------16:14----------
my life but this idea of writing people

---------16:15----------
off just because they disagree with you

---------16:17----------
on something is just ridiculous I've

---------16:19----------
talked about this gym camp book start

---------16:20----------
with no probably hundreds of times over

---------16:23----------
the past five or six years in this

---------16:24----------
channel I mean I've read his book back

---------16:26----------
in 2012 or 2013 I have no idea what his

---------16:30----------
political affiliations are and I don't

---------16:32----------
care his book provided me with very

---------16:34----------
useful information when it comes to

---------16:36----------
negotiations and dealing with things and

---------16:38----------
it helped me out tremendously if he

---------16:40----------
disagrees with me on everything else

---------16:42----------
oh well if he has really bad advice on

---------16:45----------
board repair I don't care I didn't read

---------16:47----------
his book for board or pair you know I

---------16:49----------
try to compartmentalize the advice and

---------16:53----------
what people tell me so that I don't have

---------16:55----------
to dismiss the entirety of a human being

---------16:57----------
and

---------16:57----------
every single bit of usefulness to have

---------16:59----------
to contribute to the world because in

---------17:00----------
one area I may disagree with them

---------17:02----------
there's a lot of people that say

---------17:04----------
that I disagree with but they'll

---------17:05----------
there'll be some sort of insight and I

---------17:07----------
think if you cut yourself off to all the

---------17:09----------
insight someone who has been successful

---------17:10----------
has to offer because you disagree with

---------17:12----------
them on one other section you're

---------17:13----------
screwing yourself and if one of the

---------17:15----------
other things you have to consider is you

---------17:16----------
don't actually have to listen to them

---------17:17----------
you don't know I only take that back

---------17:19----------
you don't actually have to do what they

---------17:20----------
suggest you can take in all the

---------17:22----------
information that they tell you and then

---------17:24----------
you can leave like when it came to my

---------17:27----------
videos in 2016 in 2016 I had the

---------17:30----------
counseling contact me really excited to

---------17:33----------
get me take that laptop's video down

---------17:37----------
turnin four hundred bucks an hour I paid

---------17:39----------
my attorney and he suggested that I

---------17:41----------
removed the video based on how they were

---------17:43----------
asking he didn't think that it was gonna

---------17:44----------
be a snowball effect

---------17:45----------
I listened to his advice I paid him his

---------17:47----------
fee I said thank you very much for the

---------17:49----------
time and I did the exact opposite of

---------17:50----------
what he said I can still take in the

---------17:52----------
counsel while not doing what they say

---------17:55----------
but am I really worse off for the fact

---------17:57----------
that I listen to the counsel of the

---------17:58----------
expert so we're gonna remove the is all

---------18:00----------
six two five nine that I was planning on

---------18:02----------
removing before answering a bunch of

---------18:03----------
questions as if people are confused as

---------18:04----------
to what I'm talking about you can check

---------18:06----------
out the live channel Louis rossmann live

---------18:08----------
on YouTube where a live stream all these

---------18:12----------
repairs before they are edited for the

---------18:14----------
main channel so what you're watching

---------18:17----------
right now is actually edited and

---------18:19----------
pre-recorded because all of the real

---------18:22----------
stuff happens on the live channel

---------18:26----------
so we are going to remove this

---------18:31----------
and work on our silver three laptop what

---------18:34----------
is our silver three

---------18:40----------
you're gonna remove you wait a second is

---------18:44----------
a capacitor there the capacitor could be

---------18:46----------
it I didn't see that on the schematic

---------18:48----------
that could have been the short to ground

---------18:50----------
area I'm replacing this for nothing it

---------18:54----------
could be the cap of the chip

---------18:55----------
I might if I'm here I might as well just

---------18:57----------
replace both it's no big deal

---------18:59----------
it's not like I'm it's not like I'm

---------19:02----------
paying 50 bucks a component or anything

---------19:06----------
you could see where that dial blew up it

---------19:08----------
left some junk on the board

---------19:22----------
try not to ruin that other capacitor

---------19:24----------
over there I wanted to spit some nice

---------19:27----------
lead-free solder over there make sure

---------20:12----------
where do you buy donor boards the

---------20:15----------
beginning I got him from Aliexpress and

---------20:16----------
later you know I don't think I did I got

---------20:19----------
them where did I get oh no first like

---------20:23----------
first I was getting them from just crap

---------20:27----------
that people left here where the board

---------20:31----------
had one problem I couldn't figure out it

---------20:33----------
like dead CPU or MCP or something then I

---------20:36----------
was getting them from Aliexpress leave

---------20:39----------
then I just started getting them from

---------20:40----------
the person that I get all my chips from

---------20:43----------
which honestly isn't a big price

---------20:46----------
difference from Aliexpress

---------20:59----------
okay so we are ready to get some new

---------21:03----------
stuff on this MacBook

---------21:14----------
okay we cleared away some of the excess

---------21:16----------
use rosin core and non rosin core

---------21:19----------
I wouldn't take my sorrows off of the

---------21:22----------
school to look at that right now

---------21:24----------
honestly I believe it is rosin for I

---------21:27----------
have a link to the exact thing I use

---------21:30----------
below you want to take a look at it okay

---------21:34----------
blew away all that brown stuff from the

---------21:37----------
wick the flux that's built into the wick

---------21:39----------
is some nasty stuff it's not like a it's

---------21:41----------
nice clean beautiful Ametek

---------22:02----------
any updates and GoFundMe patreon

---------22:04----------
whatever you I haven't decided it is

---------22:09----------
quite the decision

---------22:16----------
right now I'm just busy figuring out

---------22:19----------
dealing with contractor architect

---------22:22----------
managing agent building owner etc so on

---------22:25----------
and so forth

---------22:33----------
I really don't I don't like jack conte

---------22:38----------
don't want to give that dude any money

---------23:19----------
you can't even feed his cats evenly can

---------23:23----------
you ville oh the mirror are you gonna

---------23:27----------
take food away from mr. Clinton you have

---------23:29----------
the balls to do that really I'd like to

---------23:32----------
meet the man that has the balls to take

---------23:34----------
food away from mr. Clinton once he's

---------23:36----------
decided that it's his that's a person

---------23:40----------
that's gonna wind up without an eyeball

---------23:46----------
he's not really a cat he's a panther

---------23:49----------
he's a panther that can have some sort

---------23:52----------
of missing some growth hormone or

---------23:56----------
something so he looks like a kitty but

---------23:59----------
he's a panther

---------24:10----------
[Music]

---------24:20----------
look at how pretty it is look at how

---------24:23----------
pretty at all this that's a pretty

---------24:25----------
little MacBook happy little board yes

---------24:30----------
yes

---------24:31----------
Vishnu stow location is the favorite I'm

---------24:34----------
looking at well 124 West 30th Street is

---------24:38----------
all but settled let's just wait for this

---------24:39----------
to cool off a bit before we try to run

---------24:40----------
power through it and 124 West 30th

---------24:43----------
Street is pretty much settled yeah I

---------24:46----------
just need the lease to be run by the

---------24:47----------
attorney and we're good to go they're

---------24:49----------
already in discussions for the package

---------24:52----------
unit for the air conditioning that

---------24:53----------
they're going to be providing so I have

---------24:55----------
to do the ductwork I have to do the

---------24:57----------
ductwork but they're gonna provide me

---------24:58----------
with a package unit and they're also

---------25:00----------
going to do the installation of that

---------25:01----------
package unit if it has to go up to the

---------25:04----------
if it has to go up to the the roof and

---------25:07----------
we're you know the air gets out put in

---------25:10----------
my store they're gonna do that part then

---------25:12----------
I have to do the ductwork inside the

---------25:13----------
store so let's see if this board gives

---------25:15----------
us our miraculous fan spin that we're

---------25:17----------
always happy and looking for what do you

---------25:19----------
all think you think we're gonna get some

---------25:20----------
fan spin over here fan spin in time for

---------25:23----------
the Christmas season

---------25:31----------
whoa that's smoke

---------25:39----------
okay WTF

---------25:44----------
Wow okay it's beautiful okay so it looks

---------25:51----------
like that was not my problem back to the

---------25:57----------
drawing board

---------26:00----------
look at that diode it doesn't even have

---------26:02----------
legs damn

---------26:20----------
okay what the is going on here not

---------26:25----------
our normal MacBook Board here

---------26:31----------
no reward custom dollar value patreon

---------26:34----------
you deserve it

---------26:35----------
how does that work though is that is

---------26:38----------
that a recurring or a one-time or what

---------26:39----------
does that do thank you by the way so

---------26:43----------
let's see so we have 26 kilohms there

---------26:45----------
that's not the problem

---------26:47----------
twenty-eight kilohms here that's not the

---------26:49----------
problem

---------26:50----------
two ohm's here that's a problem what the

---------26:56----------
hell is this go to that's a

---------26:58----------
problem okay two ohms there we have a

---------27:01----------
serious issue so what are you charger D

---------27:08----------
CND are

---------27:15----------
schematic board here so what the f does

---------27:18----------
this do charge a DC and D are show me on

---------27:25----------
the schematic and the board view what is

---------27:28----------
this is rubbish the cookie cake is

---------27:31----------
for an L the rest is for Erica and

---------27:33----------
everyone at the shop

---------27:34----------
thank you very much JP let me just tell

---------27:37----------
them before they eat everything okay so

---------27:39----------
perhaps this capacitor over here is

---------27:41----------
what's broken I'm gonna guess that's

---------27:43----------
this or this chip because have a short

---------27:45----------
over there they have a short on charge

---------27:47----------
or DC and ER which is which pin of the

---------27:55----------
diode is this Thank You JP which is on

---------27:58----------
pin three of the diode pin three of the

---------28:00----------
diode is this so we've removed this

---------28:05----------
we have we removed this so that means

---------28:07----------
that this can I assume that this is

---------28:08----------
causing my short because I was unaware

---------28:10----------
of the fact that this went to multiple

---------28:12----------
places I'm being an idiot I'm being a

---------28:13----------
fool charger D C and D are does not only

---------28:16----------
go there it also goes up here so our

---------28:18----------
problem is up here and I was looking

---------28:19----------
down here because I did not see that

---------28:21----------
line I did not know that charger D C and

---------28:23----------
D are also went over here until this

---------28:25----------
very moment I had forgotten about that

---------28:27----------
that was silly and foolish of me and

---------28:29----------
that's why this blew up so good to know

---------28:31----------
the Chancellor of Germany watches my

---------28:32----------
stream how's it going on a little Marco

---------28:34----------
good to meet you so where is that

---------28:36----------
our 71 92 one sailed the ocean blue

---------28:39----------
that goes over here you have you 70 190

---------28:43----------
over here this is gonna actually be

---------28:45----------
producing the 5 volts required for the

---------28:47----------
ISL to work so the ISL 6259 needs to get

---------28:51----------
its PP 5 V 1 in order for it to do any

---------28:53----------
of its job and that comes from this

---------28:54----------
section over here and that's gonna be

---------29:00----------
this so the campus sitter that I think

---------29:05----------
maybe shorted is going to be on the

---------29:08----------
other side of that resistor it's gonna

---------29:10----------
be this top one over here and yeah

---------29:13----------
anybody notice that that capacitor has a

---------29:15----------
crack on it keep doing any money too as

---------29:17----------
long as you do streams while I'm awake

---------29:19----------
Mario that is too kind I don't deserve

---------29:21----------
it

---------29:21----------
but thank you very much I highly

---------29:23----------
appreciate your twenty pounds euros I'm

---------29:26----------
sorry I keep forgetting how to tell the

---------29:27----------
difference I'm a terrible

---------29:31----------
so yeah look at that this was our issue

---------29:35----------
the whole time look at that that camp

---------29:38----------
BAM man I'm dumb Co is the show

---------29:42----------
shouldn't trust a damn word that I say

---------29:44----------
let me say it now

---------29:46----------
on October 1st 2019 4:30 p.m.

---------29:49----------
shouldn't trust the damn word that I say

---------29:51----------
don't forget to budget mega exhaust for

---------29:53----------
bathrooms yep

---------29:55----------
especially since I plan to continue my

---------29:57----------
continue eating burritos so look at that

---------30:01----------
look at that cap look at that that is

---------30:02----------
cracked as cracked as it gets and I

---------30:05----------
missed it cuz I'm an idiot

---------30:06----------
cuz I forgot that on the schematic

---------30:08----------
charger dcn goes to one place but

---------30:10----------
charger DC and ER goes to two places

---------30:14----------
what are you gonna do all right so we're

---------30:17----------
gonna fix our fix it and move on

---------30:20----------
that's what we're gonna do don't forget

---------30:23----------
to budget make exhaust I read that one

---------30:29----------
it's not the blueprints that are at

---------30:30----------
fault it's me I could have clicked on

---------30:32----------
the board view and it would have shown

---------30:33----------
me even with the low quality of Paul

---------30:36----------
Daniels a software I'm kidding I love

---------30:39----------
Paul Daniels the software it's quality

---------30:41----------
stuff man I'm a damn that was careless

---------30:48----------
that was careless and that was stupid

---------30:51----------
and now we pay for it

---------31:02----------
cap is there now the real issue here is

---------31:05----------
going to be getting well where how yeah

---------31:13----------
that is a little broken alrighty that's

---------31:18----------
gonna be fun

---------31:24----------
is that a piece of that oh my god the

---------31:27----------
pad just shoot itself up entirely and

---------31:31----------
see if we can push that thing back down

---------31:34----------
yeah that is some charred burnt stuff

---------31:37----------
right there the power of seven is a few

---------31:41----------
watts

---------31:51----------
that's see you know what I could have

---------31:53----------
done there after I finished removing

---------31:54----------
everything if I had half a brain I

---------31:56----------
wouldn't have made the assumption that

---------31:58----------
my short is gone I would have checked to

---------31:59----------
see if the short is gone but I didn't

---------32:01----------
check that the short is gone thank you

---------32:03----------
for teaching me how to live life Sweden

---------32:06----------
I don't know if I've taught that but I

---------32:09----------
appreciate your 20 SEC's we should

---------32:12----------
always appreciate sex especially from a

---------32:14----------
stranger so let's see what do we get

---------32:20----------
here

---------32:21----------
forty-three kilohms short is gone okay

---------32:26----------
so now I mean to reattach my diode over

---------32:28----------
here thanks for keeping me company while

---------32:31----------
I pull an all-nighter

---------32:32----------
thank you for the 500 VY's Noel DC I

---------32:37----------
appreciate your VY's

---------33:03----------
damn ground plane use this to do the

---------33:07----------
ground plane

---------33:16----------
I do not realize our SEC was so weak you

---------33:21----------
guys are being silly okay

---------33:35----------
No

---------33:39----------
those Japanese yen awesome

---------33:51----------
that your thing becomes

---------34:49----------
they're right so we're gonna reattach

---------34:50----------
this with a wire

---------35:02----------
because these two are tied together

---------35:29----------
now that is supposed to go somewhere

---------35:31----------
else is it not because that pad is this

---------35:34----------
how do you tell the values there was the

---------35:36----------
caps the schematic tells me so the sky

---------35:40----------
I'm looking at a schematic over here and

---------35:41----------
it's got little numbers above everything

---------35:42----------
and then if I right-click on one of

---------35:45----------
these things let's say this one that

---------35:46----------
says 68 point 1 K say I right-click on

---------35:51----------
this it'll show me that resistor over

---------35:53----------
here so now I know this resistor is

---------35:54----------
sixty eight point one kilohms no this is

---------35:58----------
supposed to go somewhere you're coming

---------36:02----------
from where

---------36:13----------
that is dcn that's burned entirely

---------36:58----------
[Music]

---------37:05----------
that's gonna have to go up here

---------37:15----------
yeah fuzz

---------37:19----------
yeah your iron you smell burning fuzzing

---------37:23----------
my iron

---------37:29----------
we can use the other iron micro pencils

---------37:31----------
not doing it there

---------37:42----------
okay we got a wire

---------37:53----------
jumper wire started a fire jumper wire

---------37:58----------
start a fire

---------38:05----------
okay we're going to route this around

---------38:07----------
the board using my two tweezers

---------38:40----------
thank you to reven revenue cloud the $1

---------39:33----------
all right you're gonna go around to the

---------39:37----------
other side better routing

---------39:49----------
okay

---------39:51----------
beautiful

---------39:56----------
this board now has two guitar strings on

---------39:58----------
it

---------40:01----------
sure Paul is no problem with this at all

---------40:05----------
one let's see if we get any magic smoke

---------40:09----------
this time number one number two and go

---------40:24----------
green light seven hundred milliamps fan

---------40:27----------
spin yes all right so we should probably

---------40:31----------
rerun that wire later make a little bit

---------40:33----------
neater so what happens if you try to

---------40:36----------
become a real estate channel in the

---------40:37----------
middle of doing board repairs yeah guy

---------40:41----------
guy I'm gonna have to get a get back

---------40:42----------
into the groove of its and sandeul's not

---------40:44----------
gonna be back for a few months but

---------40:46----------
otherwise we have a working board and we

---------40:49----------
have fan spins let's just go over the

---------40:50----------
schematic in the board view go over what

---------40:52----------
it is that we did to figure out the

---------40:54----------
problem what the problem was why we the

---------40:56----------
problem was actually something different

---------40:57----------
than what we thought it was the mistakes

---------40:59----------
who made that could have been and how we

---------41:00----------
could have done this all better so if we

---------41:02----------
go over this come attic in the board

---------41:03----------
view the first thing that we had here

---------41:05----------
was this diode had exploded entirely

---------41:10----------
best wishes to Annelle just out of

---------41:11----------
curiosity you like tea so black or green

---------41:14----------
I do not like milk but I like tea I like

---------41:18----------
green tea green tea I enjoy it's just

---------41:20----------
not when it's filled with a bunch of

---------41:21----------
artificial sugar but I do enjoy tea

---------41:23----------
thank you so if we look at this over

---------41:26----------
here you'll see that this was blown up

---------41:30----------
now what I noticed is that there was a

---------41:33----------
short-circuit over here and I made the

---------41:36----------
incorrect assumption that the problem

---------41:38----------
was going to be this either the ISL 6259

---------41:43----------
was bad or some camp but the reality is

---------41:47----------
that it wasn't the ISL 65:9 because this

---------41:50----------
thing over here charger D CN d are

---------41:53----------
actually also goes up here and our

---------41:56----------
problem was this was the crack cap so oh

---------41:58----------
well now if I were smart what I would

---------42:00----------
have done is after replacing the dial

---------42:01----------
that blew up in the ISL 6259 and this

---------42:05----------
resistor what I would have done after

---------42:06----------
that if I had a brain was I would have

---------42:09----------
checked to see if the short was still

---------42:10----------
there I didn't check if the short was

---------42:12----------
still there and I plugged it in and then

---------42:14----------
what I did is I took these pad

---------42:15----------
that were not in the best of condition

---------42:17----------
and I completely eviscerated them by

---------42:20----------
running power through it again

---------42:21----------
so what I did to fix it is I replaced

---------42:23----------
this and this again I located the proper

---------42:26----------
cause of the short I removed it and

---------42:28----------
thank you very much Shh guacamole I'm

---------42:34----------
asking too much now and what I did at

---------42:37----------
that point is I ran a wire because

---------42:39----------
charger dcn over here on this side this

---------42:43----------
actually blew up entirely you're a kind

---------42:45----------
man thank you so much

---------42:47----------
this blew up entirely so the connection

---------42:50----------
between ppthe DZ and g3 isolation and

---------42:52----------
this was gone so in order to fix that I

---------42:57----------
just ran a wire from there to there I

---------42:58----------
doubled up on the wire that is not a

---------43:00----------
wire that would stand up to Paul's

---------43:02----------
inspection so I'm gonna replace the off

---------43:04----------
stream after I'm done with my chips and

---------43:07----------
guacamole because I'm not gonna be able

---------43:10----------
to run any more wires until I get my

---------43:12----------
food so thank you very much everybody

---------43:14----------
for watching and as always I genuinely

---------43:16----------
hope you learned something this is

---------43:18----------
hopefully helping you not just to see

---------43:21----------
what to do but also what not to do I

---------43:22----------
haven't been as involved with border

---------43:23----------
pears over the past month a month and a

---------43:26----------
half as I've been more involved in

---------43:27----------
finding a space dealing with brokers and

---------43:29----------
also doing the Business Administration

---------43:30----------
stuff doing the documentation for the

---------43:32----------
company everything and this is what

---------43:34----------
happens when you get out of practices

---------43:35----------
you do stupid but at the end of the

---------43:37----------
day what's even more important is that

---------43:39----------
you being able to see that not only can

---------43:41----------
what the stupid is and how to

---------43:44----------
recover from the stupid if you do

---------43:45----------
it there's also different tiers of

---------43:47----------
stupid stuff you know I'm gonna make

---------43:48----------
different precautions if it's somebody's

---------43:50----------
data this obviously does not have an SSD

---------43:52----------
attached to it so but at the end of the

---------43:55----------
day I have hope that you learn not just

---------43:57----------
what to do but also what not to do and

---------43:59----------
get a greater idea of what the thought

---------44:01----------
process is the entire way through I'm

---------44:03----------
gonna enjoy my chips and guacamole

---------44:04----------

---------44:06----------
