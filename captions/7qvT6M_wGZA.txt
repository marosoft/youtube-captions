---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be going over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero 3330 board for a 2013

---------00:04----------
model a 1286 15-inch Mac Pro the problem

---------00:08----------
with this board is that you get no

---------00:09----------
voltage anywhere you get point two volts

---------00:11----------
across the entire board and I want to go

---------00:13----------
over some of the things that I was doing

---------00:16----------
as I was trying to test it and what I

---------00:18----------
figured out so the problem with this

---------00:19----------
board is that you get absolutely nothing

---------00:21----------
when you plug the charger in so the

---------00:23----------
first thing that I did to try to

---------00:24----------
troubleshoot it since I get nothing

---------00:25----------
anywhere is I decided to try and see

---------00:29----------
what happens if I put 18 volts from my

---------00:31----------
power supply in so what I did over here

---------00:33----------
that you can see is I actually a move to

---------00:37----------
the fuse out of the way and after I

---------00:40----------
moved the fuse out of the way what I did

---------00:42----------
is I took the 18 volts from my bench

---------00:45----------
power supply which I'll show you how

---------00:46----------
that works here so I take my bench power

---------00:48----------
supply I got this thick piece of cat 5e

---------00:51----------
cable that I use just for running wires

---------00:52----------
to the bench power supply and what I did

---------00:55----------
is I started it on there and I'll show

---------00:57----------
you in the schematic in a second how

---------00:58----------
exactly I did it might as well while I'm

---------01:01----------
waiting for the iron heat up here to

---------01:02----------
show you that part so let's open the

---------01:04----------
schematic and show you what I'm talking

---------01:09----------
about okay so over here CF 6905 this is

---------01:19----------
a fuse so this is the MagSafe power jack

---------01:22----------
this is where you plug your charger in

---------01:24----------
and that goes to this fuse so little

---------01:26----------
like right at this point I get nothing

---------01:28----------
since I get nothing here I will get

---------01:30----------
nothing after here nothing at all

---------01:31----------
because at the very very beginning where

---------01:33----------
power comes into the computer I have

---------01:35----------
 so what I did is I decided to put

---------01:37----------
the charger power over here so let me

---------01:40----------
just show you what happens when I do

---------01:42----------
that on this machine I'm gonna start

---------01:44----------
that wire on right now probably not

---------01:48----------
gonna do the best soldering job since I

---------01:50----------
know I'm gonna be removing it so let's

---------01:54----------
get my ground over here Oh air filter

---------01:57----------
 hold breath hold breath hold breath

---------02:06----------
this over there all right

---------02:10----------
I take the ground of the power supply

---------02:13----------
put it on the ground of the board and

---------02:16----------
not the best soldering but I am togetic

---------02:19----------
rid of that in a second so with the

---------02:21----------
cares and over here I'm going to be

---------02:26----------
putting the 18 volts I take my 18 volts

---------02:32----------
and I put it right there so now instead

---------02:44----------
of the Machine getting 16 volts from the

---------02:47----------
charger it's gonna be getting 16 volts

---------02:49----------
from my power supply so I'm gonna turn

---------02:53----------
on my power supply here I have a HP

---------02:56----------
Agilent 65-42 a I love my 65-42 a it's a

---------03:00----------
great power supply so I'm gonna set it

---------03:02----------
to voltage 17 current I'm gonna limit it

---------03:05----------
to three amps just because you know if

---------03:07----------
anything's gonna blow up hopefully

---------03:08----------
hopefully it doesn't decide to blow up

---------03:10----------
on me I take my tester screen over here

---------03:29----------
plug it in get myself a test Ram stick

---------03:34----------
so I can show you what's going on now I

---------03:45----------
turn on the

---------03:46----------
our supply I'm gonna plug in the charger

---------03:49----------
these machines automatically turn on

---------03:51----------
when you plug in the charger now my

---------03:55----------
power supply went from saying that I'm

---------03:57----------
drawing zero amps and now it's saying

---------04:00----------
that I'm drawing something

---------04:13----------
so let's try hitting the buttons

---------04:15----------
required to turn this thing on

---------04:17----------
I left my tweezers outside let's see if

---------04:23----------
these wire cutters will do just the

---------04:25----------
short multimeter probe will do the short

---------04:29----------
power pets

---------04:53----------
you can see my screen is come on and

---------04:55----------
what I hadn't noticed before when I

---------04:57----------
originally did this is that it came on

---------04:59----------
to the question mark so what I know here

---------05:01----------
is I know I'm most likely I have a good

---------05:03----------
graphics chip I have a good CPU all the

---------05:05----------
circuitry for creating the three volt

---------05:07----------
rail the five volt rail is there my SMC

---------05:10----------
is probably good my is L six two five

---------05:11----------
nine that takes 16 volts from the

---------05:14----------
charger in terms of the 12 volts for the

---------05:15----------
system all of that right now I know is

---------05:17----------
probably good because I'm getting a

---------05:20----------
white light on the screen that turns

---------05:21----------
into a question mark as soon as I see

---------05:23----------
that white light on the screen that

---------05:24----------
turns into a question mark I know that

---------05:25----------
99% of my work is done if I had no power

---------05:28----------
she so all I have to do is figure out

---------05:29----------
why is it that I'm getting a zero volts

---------05:31----------
everywhere on this machine so it's not

---------05:35----------
the DCN fuse so let's just go back over

---------05:37----------
here and go over some of this it's not

---------05:45----------
my DC n fuse because this is fine

---------05:49----------
my one wire circuit is fine so this over

---------05:53----------
here smc bc AC okay this is fine my one

---------06:00----------
wire circuit pp 3 V 4 2 is present this

---------06:03----------
logic 8 works this chip is fine and

---------06:07----------
let's go over what may actually be the

---------06:09----------
problem here so here's what kind of got

---------06:12----------
me on this one why I was I look like an

---------06:16----------
idiot for the whole time I was working

---------06:18----------
on it so what I thought is see this chip

---------06:21----------
over here says from adapter this inrush

---------06:22----------
limiter

---------06:23----------
I thought that if this MOSFET was bad

---------06:26----------
right I thought if this was bad what

---------06:28----------
what happened is that the 16 volt would

---------06:30----------
stop over here and not make its way

---------06:32----------
through to the Machine that was my

---------06:34----------
logical assumption and my logical

---------06:36----------
assumption was completely

---------06:38----------
idiotic and wrong what happens if this

---------06:40----------
is not working the charger won't send

---------06:43----------
anything to the computer so let's take a

---------06:45----------
look at what this looks like so that's Q

---------06:46----------
7080 so this is what takes 16 volts from

---------06:49----------
the charger so right after that fuse

---------06:51----------
right after you get that fuse you get

---------06:53----------
from adapter over here so right after

---------06:55----------
that fuse that I have a wire going to

---------06:57----------
and let's check over here so our so this

---------07:00----------
is most open based on our 7086

---------07:02----------
are 70 80 and our seventy eighty one so

---------07:05----------
our 70 86 over here

---------07:09----------
let's get up in the microscope and take

---------07:12----------
a look at this my tweezers here we go I

---------07:24----------
knew they were somewhere okay so our

---------07:30----------
7080 is right here so that was our

---------07:40----------
seventy eighty six my mistake

---------07:41----------
our seventy eighty one it is right here

---------07:46----------
and our seventy eighty is right there ah

---------07:52----------
you can see our seventy eighty yeah that

---------08:01----------
so that is one of the other resistors

---------08:04----------
that's gonna be in the voltage divider

---------08:05----------
that goes to the gate of that transistor

---------08:07----------
to tell it to open and this is the other

---------08:09----------
one there's this look trustworthy to you

---------08:13----------
don't look that trustworthy to me yeah

---------08:30----------
looks like a pile of and balls if I

---------08:32----------
may say so myself so my eyes have tested

---------08:35----------
that resistor and what my eyes have told

---------08:37----------
me is my eyes told me that that resistor

---------08:39----------
is bad so I have not measured it with

---------08:41----------
the multimeter I'm just measuring it

---------08:42----------
with my you know my brain I guess and

---------08:45----------
and that's so let's go over and see what

---------08:48----------
that does in the schematic that was kind

---------08:53----------
of cool look at this that's kind of fun

---------09:04----------
I could do this all day

---------09:05----------
it's like playing snake on ecstasy Wow

---------09:10----------
anyway it's easy to entertain me it's

---------09:13----------
alright 70 80 so once power goes through

---------09:17----------
this so this voltage divider which is

---------09:24----------
controlled by you 7,000 of our 7080 and

---------09:26----------
I seventy eighty one will control this

---------09:28----------
opening and it doesn't strike me as

---------09:33----------
something that is in good health so

---------09:34----------
let's take a look and get to work that

---------09:43----------
jiggles a lot doesn't this microscope

---------09:45----------
stand is jiggles all the time this why I

---------09:50----------
can't use this thing at a zoom because

---------09:52----------
it gives me it just makes me makes me

---------09:55----------
seasick

---------09:55----------
I mean I don't mind having a microscope

---------10:00----------
that only goom's ten and thirty with a

---------10:04----------
regular Stan

---------10:55----------
resistor is in place resistor could look

---------11:01----------
nicer

---------11:31----------
this is so the wrong way to use flux but

---------11:34----------
I haven't bought an empty syringe yet I

---------11:36----------
honestly I went to search and I found a

---------11:38----------
ton of syringes that have flux in them

---------11:40----------
but I actually want to just buy an empty

---------11:41----------
one for this and I didn't find one that

---------11:44----------
I wanted they didn't find anything

---------11:46----------
actually I know I'm probably just not

---------11:47----------
looking hard enough right now two people

---------11:52----------
are on vacation at the same time so yeah

---------11:54----------
bout having time from myself for finding

---------11:58----------
things I need

---------11:59----------
no such luck on that one that's way too

---------12:02----------
much flux that's absolutely disgusting

---------12:04----------
so feel free to troll this will get

---------12:07----------
ultrasonic off anyway so I don't really

---------12:08----------
care

---------12:12----------
all right I have my perfect looking who

---------12:16----------
am i kidding

---------12:17----------
not even close to perfect but nice

---------12:19----------
looking resistors in there righty now

---------12:26----------
where I attached my DC power supply I'm

---------12:29----------
just gonna take the fuse and put it back

---------12:31----------
there so that my matic safe has a path

---------12:55----------
hey time to rotate my fuse these are the

---------13:02----------
tweezers I use to apply the flux before

---------13:05----------
yeah they're filled with flux but that's

---------13:07----------
fine make all of the most beautiful few

---------13:11----------
joints in the world now why am I doing

---------13:18----------
this on the edge of a table anyway you

---------13:21----------
get any space in New York City you can't

---------13:25----------
get any space in New York City doing

---------13:28----------
everything on the edge okay constantly

---------13:38----------
bumping into something when I serviced

---------13:39----------
the 15 inch board

---------13:50----------
no jumping you piece of you know

---------13:57----------
what you were doing and you did it

---------14:00----------
anyway

---------14:17----------
said flat

---------14:50----------
okay we're getting somewhere

---------15:08----------
same so let's see good gas but

---------15:15----------
still not working

---------15:48----------
oh you didn't heat up you beep

---------16:42----------
green-light fan spin

---------16:49----------
give me a fan to make spin come on I

---------16:53----------
didn't need this for my final testing

---------16:55----------
what did I do with all the fans here

---------16:58----------
that's an air fan aha

---------17:33----------
now fans binges yet we have voltage on

---------17:40----------
PP boys g3 heart

---------18:02----------
are you a nonworking fan is my test fan

---------18:09----------
that I picked up off of the floor dead

---------18:24----------
yes yes piece of all

---------18:35----------
right we're good so again we'll have to

---------18:42----------
run a SD on this and make sure sensors

---------18:44----------
and all that good stuff works but for

---------18:46----------
now I'm fairly happy so let's go over

---------18:47----------
what it was so over here a spike must

---------18:53----------
have come in and I would guess because

---------18:55----------
of some knockoff charger there was no

---------18:56----------
liquid damage on this board at all this

---------18:58----------
board looked pristine clear beautiful no

---------19:00----------
liquid no corrosion no nothing but on

---------19:03----------
our 7080 on the top II had some

---------19:05----------
ridiculously nasty looking junk that I

---------19:09----------
showed you under the microscope so if

---------19:10----------
this point had the visible shock what

---------19:13----------
else could have been up current

---------19:15----------
sensing resistor now these two died all

---------19:18----------
the time this doesn't and this point

---------19:20----------
looked just fine I also had measured

---------19:22----------
these prior to do in the video and prior

---------19:23----------
to driving myself nuts and over here

---------19:26----------
this is the other point the source of q7

---------19:30----------
dat so we replace our 7080 which looked

---------19:32----------
disgusting and I replaced q7 dat which

---------19:34----------
did not look disgusting but was directly

---------19:36----------
attached to our 7080 which did look

---------19:38----------
disgusting

---------19:38----------
and we have a working machine so this

---------19:41----------
was not letting the power go through the

---------19:43----------
machine and again I learned something I

---------19:45----------
really thought that if something was

---------19:46----------
wrong over here because he and this has

---------19:48----------
no path to ground I thought that if

---------19:50----------
there was something wrong over here that

---------19:51----------
the adapter would simply send 16 here or

---------19:53----------
17 here stop die and not send it forward

---------19:57----------
but it actually winds up communicating

---------19:59----------
with the charges as hey you know what q7

---------20:01----------
dat doesn't work so what I think happens

---------20:03----------
is the ISL 65:9 use 7000 on SM bus

---------20:07----------
charger SDA sm bus charger i think that

---------20:14----------
that winds up talking to the SMC see how

---------20:18----------
this is by that's bi-directional data

---------20:20----------
line so this is gonna talk to the SMC

---------20:25----------
ahem it yeah so this turns into this for

---------20:32----------
the SMC SM bus SMC v g3 SDA

---------20:38----------
smbus sm c5 g3 SDA is going to go to the

---------20:44----------
SMC with so that chip is gonna talk to

---------20:47----------
this and then you have sis one wire over

---------20:50----------
here sis underscore one wire

---------20:52----------
I really have to learn how to not be so

---------20:55----------
se now that this microphone that I have

---------20:56----------
picks them up like crazy this is

---------20:58----------
actually a good microphone you can't

---------20:59----------
blame the microphone you blame the

---------21:01----------
speaker so yeah this one wire over here

---------21:04----------
and this speaks to you 6900 you 6900 is

---------21:10----------
going to speak to the charger and so

---------21:13----------
what I'm thinking is going on as one use

---------21:15----------
7000 notices that q7 dat doesn't work it

---------21:17----------
tells the charger you know instead of

---------21:19----------
putting out power since I'm not gonna be

---------21:20----------
getting it anyway how about you be

---------21:21----------
efficient and just don't send out

---------21:22----------
anything at all and that's what I

---------21:24----------
imagined was happening here that's and

---------21:27----------
now it works and now I was in microscope

---------21:29----------
for you I'm not quite sure how long I

---------21:31----------
was in microscope for you for let's go

---------21:33----------
back here and check out the PDF so yes

---------21:35----------
since one wire is how the Mac safe

---------21:39----------
communicates with the SMC the SM bus

---------21:42----------
data line is how the SMC communicates

---------21:44----------
with you 7000 use 7000 is what controls

---------21:47----------
Q 7080 which is a MOSFET that will open

---------21:50----------
or closed depending on what you 7000

---------21:52----------
tells it and this pretty much was

---------21:55----------
and so was this voltage divider so you

---------21:57----------
7000 on smbus charger SDA told the SMC

---------22:01----------
to tell the charger hey don't turn on

---------22:03----------
and that's how we got where we are right

---------22:05----------
now and by replacing our 7080 and Q 7080

---------22:09----------
I have a board that works that's ready

---------22:11----------
to be sent back to my customer who say

---------22:13----------
hey this actually got sent here from

---------22:14----------
from Europe so that's that's pretty cool

---------22:17----------
I mean these videos are actually getting

---------22:19----------
viewed in in in countries where people

---------22:22----------
are openly saying I don't speak English

---------22:24----------
you know I'm speaking to you through a

---------22:26----------
translator I want to send you this and I

---------22:28----------
mean my that these videos are getting

---------22:30----------
that much of a reach is actually really

---------22:32----------
really cool so that's it for today and I

---------22:34----------
hope you learned something
