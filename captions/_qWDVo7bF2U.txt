---------00:00----------
all right so today we're gonna be going

---------00:01----------
over a board that doesn't turn on and we

---------00:03----------
got a couple of telltale signs yeah that

---------00:05----------
really hinted what it is that's going on

---------00:06----------
so one of the first things that you see

---------00:08----------
when you look at this board is that the

---------00:09----------
battery itself is exploding or as Apple

---------00:12----------
would like to call it so they don't get

---------00:13----------
sued expanding so the battery itself is

---------00:16----------
expanding and then also when you look

---------00:18----------
under the microscope if you got the user

---------00:20----------
brain cap on what you'll notice into the

---------00:22----------
microscope is that in the CPU vcore area

---------00:25----------
these capacitors look really really

---------00:27----------
nasty see that one in the middle that

---------00:29----------
bulging exploding pile of see that

---------00:35----------
no good now let me just I don't even

---------00:39----------
have to open the schematic to know

---------00:40----------
what's going on here that capacitor is

---------00:42----------
for providing power to CPU vcore that

---------00:45----------
capacitor over there is a I could pass

---------00:49----------
it over there comes from the pp bus g3

---------00:51----------
hot rail that's the a volt power line

---------00:53----------
that burns through through through

---------00:54----------
Rhodes off that gets created by the

---------00:56----------
charger or that is always present with

---------00:58----------
the battery so the battery's direct

---------01:00----------
output is the pp bus g3 huh the power is

---------01:02----------
always present so since that power rail

---------01:05----------
is directly shorted to ground what

---------01:06----------
you're doing is you're shorting the

---------01:07----------
battery output to ground and the battery

---------01:09----------
ain't really happy with that which is

---------01:11----------
why the batteries exploding so the first

---------01:12----------
thing that we're gonna do to try to fix

---------01:14----------
this pile of crap here is and this this

---------01:18----------
is not a board repair where I feel it is

---------01:20----------
even necessary to remove the board

---------01:22----------
because there's just there's really just

---------01:25----------
nothing to see on the other side there's

---------01:26----------
not much to analyze here the first thing

---------01:28----------
to do is to remove that exploded

---------01:30----------
capacitor and replace it with one that

---------01:33----------
is and see if the short goes away and

---------01:35----------
then once the short goes away we're

---------01:36----------
gonna replace it with one that's not

---------01:37----------
exploded let's wait for this thing to

---------01:43----------
heat up

---------01:49----------
this is the fun part here super fun part

---------01:53----------
smelling and exploded capacitor as you

---------01:55----------
heat it

---------02:22----------
the air filters not doing jack

---------02:25----------
right now the fume extractors doing

---------02:28----------
nothing moving these is just a [ __ ]

---------02:45----------
okay usually I so what I say to do is to

---------02:50----------
tap it to make sure that it's fully

---------02:51----------
liquidus and then lift it here I'm doing

---------02:53----------
the opposite I don't want to overheat

---------02:55----------
that entire area I don't feel like

---------02:56----------
eating every capacitor and then causing

---------02:58----------
every other capacitor to explode in

---------02:59----------
tandem so I'm and those are very very

---------03:01----------
large pads on the board and I know that

---------03:04----------
with the thermal mass and the that

---------03:06----------
section of the board and also with how

---------03:07----------
big this component is it's not going to

---------03:08----------
come off easy so I am actually actively

---------03:10----------
pulling the entire time there

---------03:29----------
hey let's wake up the old nasty

---------03:32----------
lead-free solder STFU heck Oh

---------04:41----------
this is big enough stuff that I feel

---------04:43----------
kind of silly doing it under a

---------04:44----------
microscope it's more important to me

---------04:46----------
that I can hold the iron straight up

---------04:48----------
because holding the iron straight up

---------04:50----------
here is going to give me the advantage

---------04:51----------
of having more heat and you need a lot

---------04:53----------
of heat to remove that and I want to

---------04:55----------
concentrate the heat I want to make sure

---------04:57----------
the heat sticks to that particular area

---------05:02----------
let's find the same board Oh what do you

---------05:11----------
know I've stolen all of that on the same

---------05:13----------
board alright okay let's see if a

---------05:17----------
different board uses the same thing this

---------05:20----------
is the part where I wish I had quadruple

---------05:22----------
monitors on for schematic one for board

---------05:24----------
view one for schematic for a second

---------05:26----------
board one for board view of a second

---------05:28----------
board okay so the capacitor that

---------05:32----------
exploded of course you open in the

---------05:37----------
opposite way I have the on the desk

---------05:39----------
why would you ever open the way I have

---------05:41----------
the board in the desk

---------05:42----------
let's see master that exploded was c75

---------05:48----------
14 and ground is on the right

---------05:50----------
so c75 14

---------06:09----------
well the PDF reader is finding that

---------06:11----------
let's see if my short went away on that

---------06:14----------
bus

---------06:17----------
that's a 62 okay 62 rod poly capacitor

---------06:28----------
my short to ground has gone away lovely

---------06:41----------
okay now let's see if this yeah like

---------06:46----------
take a capacitor from this 3437 board

---------06:49----------
okay what was I

---------06:51----------
ah yes looking on a 3437 board and

---------06:55----------
seeing if those capacitors are usable

---------06:58----------
okay so let's open the 34 37 34 37 board

---------07:05----------
view and at 34 37 board view okay so

---------07:16----------
recording good software

---------07:28----------
see 73-70

---------07:42----------
these are rated 262 microfarad oh but

---------07:48----------
you're a tantalum poly and not a regular

---------07:50----------
poly oh boy that makes me mad

---------07:53----------
I hate tantalum I do hate tantalum but

---------07:59----------
and what are you gonna do hopefully it

---------08:05----------
doesn't blow up in my face okay

---------08:17----------
girl alright I'll take it

---------08:35----------
you just explode

---------08:40----------
 tantalum okay take two

---------08:49----------
so what editing would be come in handy

---------09:05----------
for obvious reasons I'm not going to

---------09:07----------
plug that battery back in I enjoy having

---------09:13----------
my face

---------09:29----------
will you turn on if you turn on will you

---------09:31----------
work or will you explode

---------09:33----------
what were the fan spins didn't do that

---------09:36----------
when I had one volt on PP bish g3 hot

---------09:38----------
hey you're a chime and are you gonna

---------09:42----------
boot no you're not gonna boot because I

---------09:44----------
left the SSD on the table and I

---------09:49----------
had dumbass alright boot come on show

---------09:58----------
the camera that Louis knows how to fix a

---------10:00----------
motherboard there we go so we had here

---------10:03----------
as a short to ground again the hints my

---------10:06----------
battery is exploding my battery directly

---------10:08----------
provides PP bus g3 Han oh look at that

---------10:10----------
component that looks completely

---------10:12----------
destroyed and skull-fucked and what do

---------10:14----------
you know it runs off a pp bus g3 art and

---------10:16----------
as a path directly to ground and this

---------10:19----------
board was giving me about 1.3 1.8 volts

---------10:22----------
on pp bus g3 hop friend that's that's

---------10:25----------
not what I was supposed to get I'm

---------10:26----------
supposed to get what I'm supposed to get

---------10:27----------
eight so we are all fixed we're good and

---------10:31----------
that's that I did not have to use a

---------10:33----------
short finder I did not have to use a

---------10:36----------
bench power supply all I had to use was

---------10:39----------
my brain that's that the brain is pretty

---------10:43----------
awesome isn't it can make some good

---------10:45----------
money using your brain
