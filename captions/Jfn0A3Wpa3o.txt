---------00:00----------
I just can't describe how screwed up

---------00:01----------
this is is showing up to your store on a

---------00:03----------
day where it is $16.50 opposed to pacify

---------00:32----------
me it doesn't it doesn't it's cold in

---------00:35----------
here it's freezing I had to sit in my

---------00:37----------
chair and wait for like five minutes for

---------00:39----------
it to get warm before I could even turn

---------00:41----------
on the stream this is absolute [ __ ]

---------00:43----------
because if it's six degrees outside and

---------00:46----------
those space heaters that keep turning

---------00:47----------
off and triggering themselves because

---------00:49----------
they're just not working oh it's just I

---------00:54----------
can only imagine what the temperature

---------00:55----------
isn't here anyway so I'm gonna try to

---------00:57----------
fix this MacBook here while it's

---------01:00----------
freezing in my office

---------01:01----------
the MacBook itself feels like it's

---------01:03----------
freezing this MacBook is as cold as the

---------01:06----------
heart of a Swede that punches you so

---------01:07----------
let's go through this board and see if

---------01:09----------
we can find anything now as you noticed

---------01:11----------
we have a lot of pubes on this board and

---------01:13----------
there's always a lot of pubes on the

---------01:14----------
board because it's a MacBook

---------01:16----------
it's a MacBook of course it's going to

---------01:18----------
have pubes in the board pubes you're not

---------01:20----------
what troubles me

---------01:23----------
what's going to trouble me is if we see

---------01:26----------
any sort of signs of liquid damage hmm

---------01:31----------
no those are just multicolored pubes so

---------01:36----------
here we have what I would call

---------01:38----------
pubes of diversity we have pubes over

---------01:41----------
here that are white pubes over here that

---------01:45----------
are black pubes over here that are red

---------02:00----------
there's no heat mean reduction in rent

---------02:02----------
it means mmm we'll see

---------02:24----------
why don't you take them to court then

---------02:28----------
because court in New York City is a

---------02:31----------
gigantic waste of time the first thing I

---------02:37----------
want to do to bait them is just stop

---------02:38----------
paying rent until I get heat and hope

---------02:46----------
that that works and then if that doesn't

---------02:47----------
work then you go to court the court is a

---------02:50----------
big waste of time

---------02:51----------
court means no fixing boards court means

---------02:55----------
yeah court means you're not fixing

---------02:57----------
boards court means you're not playing

---------02:59----------
dota court means you're not streaming

---------03:02----------
you're just sitting in court

---------03:04----------
aha green pubes this is a color that

---------03:08----------
interests me what are you for little

---------03:11----------
chip so this chip over here has to do

---------03:13----------
with Bluetooth now let's ask a simple

---------03:20----------
question here on a machine that doesn't

---------03:23----------
turn on do I care about Bluetooth no I

---------03:27----------
don't care about bluetooth the machine

---------03:30----------
doesn't even turn on I don't have a

---------03:32----------
chance to care about Bluetooth Bluetooth

---------03:34----------
is the least of my concerns we're going

---------03:36----------
to keep going keep looking around the

---------03:38----------
board and see if we find anything else

---------03:40----------
but at this point we know that the

---------03:42----------
customer at one point did get liquid

---------03:44----------
damage on the machine but that being

---------04:01----------
said

---------04:06----------
aha more green look at this look at this

---------04:12----------
greenery

---------04:13----------
what are you oh you're green you're very

---------04:18----------
green

---------04:19----------
you're very green here is green as

---------04:23----------
Gillette Fusion shaving cream is when

---------04:26----------
you lather it on your face before you

---------04:30----------
throw it away and never use delet

---------04:33----------
shaving products on your face again so

---------04:36----------
this here has got to go because if I

---------04:41----------
show you on the schematic in the board

---------04:42----------
view what that's for

---------04:45----------
you 7501 right here is a power I see see

---------04:53----------
right over here it says 5 volt 3.3 volt

---------04:57----------
power supply this is actually important

---------04:59----------
it creates the 3.3 volt rail over here

---------05:02----------
and it also creates the 5 volt rail over

---------05:07----------
here

---------05:12----------
so we're going to replace that ship with

---------05:14----------
another chip that comes from store

---------05:16----------
osmond group comm chips from store osman

---------05:20----------
group comm the best a man can get

---------05:51----------
you may notice this chip doesn't want to

---------05:53----------
come off the board that's because it's

---------05:55----------
six degrees today in my office has no

---------05:57----------
heating this chip does not want to leave

---------06:02----------
this board and this is even after I've

---------06:05----------
put leaded solder everywhere this is

---------06:10----------
impressive

---------06:12----------
okay as can be seen it's much more

---------06:17----------
obvious once every all the old ship

---------06:20----------
that's been removed from the board that

---------06:22----------
that was never going to work because we

---------06:24----------
have a pad over here that's almost

---------06:25----------
completely corroded and gone let's see

---------06:28----------
if we can bring that pad back with a

---------06:30----------
little bit of strategic rework all right

---------06:37----------
now you see how all that red stuff

---------06:39----------
that's coming up that's the board

---------06:41----------
bleeding

---------06:47----------
the board is bleeding so we're just

---------06:50----------
gonna wipe all that blood away we're

---------06:56----------
gonna suck up all that blood they're

---------07:01----------
gonna remove all that blood suck it all

---------07:03----------
up into the this t30 - can

---------07:20----------
let's see if we can bring that pad back

---------07:24----------
I'm gonna use mighty 30 - can soldering

---------07:27----------
tip the best a Macbook board can get

---------07:31----------
let's see if we can bring that back oh

---------07:34----------
yes we can

---------07:36----------
oh yes we can yes indeed my friends we

---------07:41----------
are gonna fix this this MacBook will

---------07:44----------
work again

---------07:50----------
you know what genuinely hysterical to me

---------07:53----------
is that Apple said that this had no

---------07:56----------
liquid damage but it was just the board

---------07:58----------
failure which is funny because for the

---------08:01----------
CBC news piece they said there was

---------08:03----------
liquid damage on a machine that I did

---------08:04----------
not find any liquid damage on and this

---------08:07----------
is one of the parts that kills me as

---------08:09----------
everybody who says look on the CBC piece

---------08:13----------
there was a liquid damage indicator yeah

---------08:15----------
but what they don't show you is that I

---------08:17----------
spent a good two minutes going around

---------08:20----------
the board in the microscope camera to

---------08:22----------
show you that there was zero evidence of

---------08:23----------
liquid damage on the board itself but

---------08:26----------
that did not make its way into the

---------08:27----------
documentary oh well such is life I kind

---------08:31----------
of wish it did because I probably have

---------08:32----------
like one or two thousand comments on

---------08:35----------
that and I've just stopped replying to

---------08:36----------
them at this point but it's interesting

---------08:39----------
like they really do just go by that

---------08:42----------
little sticker but that machine had a

---------08:45----------
sticker zero evidence of liquid damage

---------08:47----------
this machine had no liquid indicators

---------08:51----------
tripped yet there are just V there are

---------08:56----------
traces that and pads that are totally

---------08:59----------
destroyed which I'm fixing with a wire

---------09:03----------
such a brainless system and I understand

---------09:08----------
that you need a brainless system for

---------09:10----------
like the you know the front-end retail

---------09:11----------
but they do take the machines at the

---------09:14----------
back they open it up they make it seem

---------09:17----------
like they're actually like

---------09:18----------
troubleshooting it and all that and in

---------09:20----------
that amount of time you should be I

---------09:21----------
think that it's reasonable as an

---------09:24----------
expectation for you to be able to see oh

---------09:26----------
look there's green corrosion oh look

---------09:29----------
there's no green corrosion you know

---------09:36----------
no no what do I know

---------10:11----------
I'm just an idiot who thinks that you

---------10:13----------
shouldn't stop somebody on the street if

---------10:15----------
they're approaching somebody when you

---------10:17----------
before you even know if they actually

---------10:18----------
know each other have a relationship yet

---------10:20----------
because that's none of your business

---------10:22----------
what do I know what the eff do I know I

---------10:28----------
use Bronner shaving cream I'm a pleb

---------10:36----------
lowly peasant

---------10:41----------
I know nothing

---------10:45----------
I don't even know how to detect liquid

---------10:47----------
damage okay

---------11:44----------
all right a little messy a little messy

---------11:46----------
but we can always fix that

---------11:59----------
so who's coming to the 1 million

---------12:01----------
subscriber party bash

---------12:37----------
all right now let me fix my jumper which

---------12:39----------
is a little out of place

---------12:44----------
Who am I kidding a little out of place

---------12:46----------
not soldered shouldn't be so generous

---------12:50----------
with myself okay

---------12:57----------
much better

---------13:23----------
as can be seen we have fans but of

---------13:26----------
course we have fans been we always have

---------13:29----------
fans been this is an eight to zero 34 37

---------13:33----------
so when you first turn it on from it not

---------13:35----------
having battery power it's going to turn

---------13:37----------
on/off on/off on/off but the fan

---------13:39----------
spinning is indeed a sign that we have

---------13:41----------
fixed the MacBook so the 5 volt 3 volt

---------13:44----------
regulator had liquid damage on it we

---------13:47----------
removed it and we were able to see that

---------13:48----------
a pad was almost entirely missing and

---------13:51----------
looking at the board view that appears

---------13:54----------
to be a pad that deals with the 5 volt

---------13:58----------
rail that would have been coming on so

---------14:00----------
we took that off we ran a jumper wire we

---------14:04----------
put the chip on cleaned it up made sure

---------14:06----------
our jumper wire is making good contact

---------14:08----------
and now we've got a working motherboard

---------14:10----------
so that's just about all there is to it

---------14:11----------
I really hope that this this kind of

---------14:14----------
stuff gets you interested in opening up

---------14:15----------
your own stuff that's not working and

---------14:17----------
getting to work and making it work again

---------14:20----------
whether it's something that's

---------14:21----------
ridiculously incredibly complicated or

---------14:24----------
something as simple as an 11 inch

---------14:26----------
MacBook Air with liquid damage by the

---------14:28----------
DCN connector that you open it up figure

---------14:31----------
it out and stream it
