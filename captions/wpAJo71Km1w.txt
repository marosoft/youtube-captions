---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be going over an

---------00:01----------
eight to zero twenty nine thirty six

---------00:03----------
board that does not turn on so here we

---------00:06----------
have the board and the issue with it is

---------00:08----------
that you will get a green light on the

---------00:10----------
charger but it does not actually turn on

---------00:13----------
so let's plug it in so I can show you so

---------00:18----------
as you can see I have a green light but

---------00:22----------
my fan is not spinning so we have to

---------00:25----------
troubleshoot what's going on here so now

---------00:27----------
one of the things I've shown you and

---------00:29----------
prior videos is that one of the

---------00:31----------
beautiful things that you'll find and

---------00:33----------
the schematic is that on the beginning

---------00:36----------
of the schematic you'll see a list of

---------00:38----------
power rails that should be present so

---------00:40----------
you don't actually have to work in guess

---------00:41----------
to see what should and should not be

---------00:43----------
present you can simply look at it and it

---------00:46----------
will give you a nice little list well

---------00:49----------
when I say nice I'm being a little being

---------00:52----------
a little bit of a troll because as you

---------00:54----------
could see it's kind of long so you have

---------00:56----------
all these rails from top to bottom here

---------00:58----------
and let's point and show you

---------01:12----------
so you have pp bus g3 Haunt which is the

---------01:15----------
12 volt rail that the machine runs off

---------01:17----------
of so let's measure that and I'm gonna

---------01:23----------
measure that in the multimeter although

---------01:28----------
this you could see the meter a little

---------01:29----------
bit even though it's probably them and

---------01:31----------
still invisible and be hidden behind a

---------01:33----------
pole in spring bottle so over here I've

---------01:38----------
got you know I do this this is backlit

---------01:41----------
you can actually see it and the board

---------01:47----------
view will tell you what these points are

---------01:48----------
so if I want to measure P P Buster III

---------01:50----------
huh what I can do is I can go to the

---------01:51----------
board view software that I have open

---------01:53----------
over here I can click n type P P bus

---------01:57----------
underscore g3 hot hit okay it will zoom

---------02:01----------
me out because it's a piece of and

---------02:03----------
then it will show me all the points on

---------02:04----------
the board along which P P bus g3 yacht

---------02:07----------
shows up so one of the places it shows

---------02:12----------
up is this big white fuse over here so

---------02:14----------
I'm gonna measure and I see on the

---------02:17----------
oscilloscope I see 12 point 7 volts you

---------02:20----------
see how it just jump there that's a jump

---------02:22----------
into twelve point seven I don't feel

---------02:23----------
like zooming in and figured he can trust

---------02:25----------
me when I say that as 12 point 7 the

---------02:27----------
next power rail here is one that is

---------02:30----------
dragged from P P bus g3 hot so I'm not

---------02:33----------
gonna bother testing that P P bus s 5 HS

---------02:35----------
computing I sense I don't I don't care

---------02:37----------
about that because that is actually

---------02:39----------
drawn from PP bus g3 huh it's aim for

---------02:41----------
this then we have P P bus P P dcin

---------02:43----------
underscore g3 hot that's the 18 point 5

---------02:46----------
volt rail the machine that's the 18

---------02:48----------
point 5 volt rail that comes from the

---------02:49----------
charger now the charger gives the board

---------02:53----------
power to create P P bus g3 huh so if I

---------02:55----------
already have g PP bus g3 huh why do I

---------02:57----------
care about this DC n power L I don't pp

---------03:01----------
3 V 4 2 I know I have as I've explained

---------03:03----------
in other videos how the 1 wire circuit

---------03:05----------
works the one wire circuit is has a

---------03:07----------
logic gate in it that is powered off of

---------03:09----------
pp 3 V 4 2 so if I have a green line my

---------03:11----------
charger obviously I have that so

---------03:12----------
checking that is pointless

---------03:13----------
PPV RTC underscore g3 hot that is a

---------03:17----------
different supply it's I'm not really

---------03:20----------
interested in seeing if I have clock

---------03:22----------
signal yet because it doesn't turn off

---------03:23----------
even

---------03:24----------
if I did not have clock even if I did

---------03:25----------
not have clock at least see the fan spin

---------03:27----------
it would spin and then it would turn off

---------03:28----------
RTC is one of the clocks and the machine

---------03:31----------
that synchronizes the you know

---------03:32----------
everything so that it knows what to do

---------03:34----------
and turns on this you know works when I

---------03:38----------
say turns on and I mean turns on like

---------03:39----------
actually fan spins I mean you know CPU

---------03:43----------
PCH all that good stuff

---------03:45----------
next is pp 5vs5 let's see if I have pp

---------03:50----------
5vs5 I hit an over here PP 5v underscore

---------03:53----------
s5 and where does it show up PP 5vs5

---------03:59----------
shows up over here on the main board so

---------04:05----------
right next to you 7200 so I touch the

---------04:07----------
oscilloscope probe over here to that

---------04:09----------
part of the board and I see five volts

---------04:11----------
okay so all the power supplies are

---------04:13----------
checking out so far let's check the next

---------04:15----------
one next one is pp 5 vs 3 so let's check

---------04:18----------
PP 5 vs 3 I check PP 5 V underscore s 3

---------04:22----------
and what do I have here so let's bring

---------04:27----------
it to the side of the board this is a

---------04:29----------
point where I can check it let's see I

---------04:34----------
can check that power supply right here

---------04:38----------
so when I plug this oscilloscope test

---------04:41----------
lead here to check for PP 5 vs 3 I get 0

---------04:45----------
see now I'm interested because one of

---------04:47----------
the rails is missing now the 5 volt rail

---------04:49----------
is one of the rails that you need in

---------04:51----------
order for the thing to turn off so PP 5

---------04:53----------
es 3 will get turned into PP 5 vs o s 3

---------04:56----------
means it's oh it's on its present when

---------04:59----------
the machine is off or sleeping or

---------05:00----------
something or hibernating whatever and SL

---------05:02----------
means that rail is presence when the

---------05:04----------
machine itself is actually on so there

---------05:07----------
is something on the machine that says

---------05:08----------
when you plug this in when you plug the

---------05:10----------
MagSafe in and when you are turning the

---------05:13----------
machine on turn PP 5 es 3 and a PP 5 es

---------05:15----------
o let whatever is present at PP 5 vs 3

---------05:18----------
flow to PP 5 years so to turn the

---------05:19----------
machine on and that that's not present

---------05:22----------
so one of the things I want to do first

---------05:23----------
before I actually start with it

---------05:25----------
is see if there is a short to ground on

---------05:27----------
that power rail so I'm putting my

---------05:29----------
multimeter in diode mode because it

---------05:30----------
gives me very very quick measurements

---------05:31----------
I'm gonna put my red probe on ground and

---------05:34----------
my black probe here right where I tried

---------05:36----------
to measure PP 5 es 3

---------05:44----------
what I have here is not a short to

---------05:46----------
ground at all I have a fairly healthy

---------05:48----------
reading so I'm not real I'm getting a

---------05:50----------
very very I'm getting a very high

---------05:54----------
voltage drop to ground so now what I'm

---------05:56----------
interested in the scene will this thing

---------05:57----------
actually turn on if I just put five

---------06:00----------
volts there so what I'm gonna do right

---------06:01----------
now is put five volts there using this

---------06:04----------
HP Agilent power supply that I got so

---------06:07----------
watch what I do here so I'm just gonna

---------06:09----------
make a space to solder my ground wire

---------06:13----------
Here I am going to put some solder on

---------06:18----------
that little space and then I'm going to

---------06:22----------
put the wires so this here is a bench

---------06:25----------
power supply it's a youlet Packard 65 42

---------06:28----------
a it is old probably older than me it is

---------06:31----------
old but it is good old it is a

---------06:33----------
linear power supply which is very

---------06:35----------
inefficient however even though it is

---------06:37----------
inefficient it is a linear supply with

---------06:40----------
very very low ripple so you can use it

---------06:41----------
for powering it's very very accurate so

---------06:44----------
when you say I want five point zero zero

---------06:46----------
two volts it will give you five point

---------06:48----------
zero zero two volts which is cool if

---------06:50----------
you're a nerd or you want to use it to

---------06:52----------
power cool things or audio circuits or

---------06:54----------
things where you

---------06:55----------
ripple actually matters but I mainly got

---------06:58----------
it because it was 120 bucks and I needed

---------07:00----------
a bench power supply and if I want to

---------07:02----------
buy a new bench power supply for a

---------07:03----------
hundred fifty bucks you will get

---------07:05----------
something that is kind of a piece of

---------07:07----------


---------07:07----------
whereas if I'm willing to buy used and

---------07:09----------
wait for a while I got this I got this

---------07:11----------
to replace my Lenovo which finally hit

---------07:14----------
the bucket so what I'm gonna do here is

---------07:18----------
I'm gonna set my bench power supply when

---------07:21----------
I set the voltage to it to five volts

---------07:23----------
and then we're gonna set the maximum

---------07:24----------
current the two amps because there's

---------07:26----------
there's really no reason to provide more

---------07:27----------
than two amps to this if it does

---------07:28----------
that means there's a short of some kind

---------07:30----------
they don't want to blow things up so

---------07:32----------
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plug this

---------07:33----------
in and then as soon as I plug it in and

---------07:35----------
I see the light turn green I'm gonna

---------07:37----------
turn the power on on this bench power

---------07:39----------
supply and I want to see if it turns on

---------07:42----------
Blair

---------07:46----------
and it did turn on you can see here

---------07:49----------
remember these core i5 i7 boards

---------07:51----------
actually do turn on on their own and as

---------07:53----------
you can see I have a spinning fan and as

---------07:56----------
you can also see on the bench power

---------07:57----------
supply here you probably can because

---------07:59----------
it's covered by a [ __ ] of wires

---------08:01----------
and numerous pole and spring bottles is

---------08:02----------
that my power supply is delivering four

---------08:05----------
point nine nine nine volts at 0.18 amps

---------08:07----------
which means it is actually delivering

---------08:09----------
power to the firewall rail it is doing

---------08:10----------
something now one of the things I want

---------08:14----------
to do is actually check out why that

---------08:17----------
 ain't working so I know that I've

---------08:19----------
gotten somewhere I know that if I have

---------08:20----------
power on that line at you know the

---------08:22----------
computers not going to blow up that it

---------08:24----------
is good is okay so I'm gonna just remove

---------08:27----------
that wire that I put there and let's

---------08:36----------
take a look under the microscope to get

---------08:37----------
a closer look a better idea of what is

---------08:39----------
going on let me turn this off and also

---------08:45----------
let me show you on the schematic what

---------08:46----------
we're looking at I'm using the wrong

---------08:51----------
soldering iron tip for this this is a

---------08:52----------
micro tip that i'm using to remove a

---------08:54----------
huge blob that I made alright

---------08:59----------
oh into the microscope we go so first

---------09:03----------
things first actually before the

---------09:05----------
microscope is schematic let's get a

---------09:07----------
little bit of learning done here so the

---------09:08----------
power supply that is missing is pp 5 vs

---------09:10----------
3 so let's see what PP 5 vs 3 is for

---------09:13----------
what it does and man I really need to

---------09:16----------
get a camera person for this

---------09:18----------
alright so PP 5 V underscore s 3 come on

---------09:27----------
show me where you're made from

---------09:33----------
okay well I'm gonna cheat because I

---------09:34----------
already know where it's made for me I

---------09:35----------
want to save time I'm gonna search for

---------09:37----------
that ship okay so this is the chip that

---------09:41----------
makes PP 5 vs 3 now to explain a little

---------09:46----------
bit of how this thing works there is an

---------09:48----------
end trip signal over here that when you

---------09:50----------
go to turn the machine on goes up to 3

---------09:52----------
volts if that signal is allowed to go up

---------09:55----------
to 3 volts for a second it will actually

---------09:58----------
turn the rail on but if that is not

---------10:00----------
allowed to go up it won't turn it on so

---------10:02----------
you have a little transistor down here

---------10:03----------
that will actually take that and send it

---------10:06----------
straight to ground right over here

---------10:07----------
depending on what the PCH of the mCP

---------10:10----------
tells the computer that it ought to do

---------10:12----------
you also have other things here that are

---------10:14----------
important to know about so this control

---------10:17----------
 PDF reader so this chip controls

---------10:20----------
this buck regulator here this buck

---------10:22----------
regulated takes 12 volt pulses it makes

---------10:24----------
a bunch of 12 volt pulses and sends

---------10:26----------
those 12 volt pulses to the input of

---------10:27----------
this inductor where those 12 volt pulses

---------10:29----------
then turn into 5 volts for the machine

---------10:32----------
once we get this working I'll show you

---------10:33----------
what the input and the output look like

---------10:34----------
so this chip does use 7200 which is TPS

---------10:37----------
500 to 5 this chip right here it

---------10:39----------
controls these two transistors which

---------10:42----------
then make power for the inductor which

---------10:45----------
then gets smooth out into a nice 5 volts

---------10:46----------
it was on so one of the things that I'd

---------10:48----------
like to do when I find a problem is try

---------10:50----------
to find a story I like to try to follow

---------10:51----------
a story I like to follow science but I

---------10:54----------
also like to see why it actually happens

---------10:57----------
so there's the science and then there's

---------10:58----------
a real-world application of the science

---------11:00----------
so let's try to get a look here and see

---------11:02----------
what's going on so I'm gonna go on to

---------11:04----------
the microscope but I'm gonna look at

---------11:05----------
this chip and I'm gonna try to get an

---------11:07----------
idea of what exactly happened and in

---------11:08----------
what order it happens so I know what to

---------11:10----------
do so this here is my TPS 5 1 1 2 5 and

---------11:16----------
this is the chip and as you can see over

---------11:19----------
here there is a red probe point this is

---------11:21----------
the kind of thing that I want I want to

---------11:23----------
see that and I want you to look at that

---------11:24----------
and have an innate understanding of what

---------11:27----------
went on in the circuit as soon as you

---------11:28----------
see that so I want you to have an idea

---------11:30----------
of how the electricity passed through

---------11:32----------
the circuit I want you have an idea

---------11:33----------
exactly what it is that happened in

---------11:35----------
order for the destruction to occur and

---------11:37----------
that's something that you're gonna get

---------11:40----------
with experience but it's also something

---------11:42----------
you're gonna get just by looking at the

---------11:44----------
board so that little ribby time you see

---------11:45----------
those red probe

---------11:46----------
it's usually indicative of water damage

---------11:48----------
of some kind that landed there and does

---------11:50----------
something going through that wasn't

---------11:51----------
supposed to so let's get a look at the

---------11:53----------
board view and see what that's supposed

---------11:54----------
to be so that probe point is I really

---------12:08----------
need a joystick for this thing I would

---------12:10----------
David I didn't need to make them joy

---------12:12----------
stick for this board view software

---------12:13----------
because it is so goddamn frustrating

---------12:15----------
sometimes to use with okay so so over

---------12:22----------
here we have this is the pro point that

---------12:25----------
I'm talking about right here and that is

---------12:26----------
p5 vs3 underscore VB ST underscore R so

---------12:31----------
now I'm gonna open up the schematic

---------12:32----------
before I open up the schematic p5 vs3

---------12:36----------
underscore VB ST underscore R I want to

---------12:39----------
see every point that this shows up on

---------12:40----------
this board and of course when I do that

---------12:42----------
it zooms me out completely so that I

---------12:43----------
can't see because that is how this

---------12:45----------
crappy software works it is what it is

---------12:47----------
asn't been updated since 1995 so that

---------12:50----------
pro point you have this capacitor and

---------12:52----------
this resistor right next to it simple C

---------12:53----------
70 to 60 and our 70 to 60 so let's see

---------12:57----------
what those look like over here on the

---------12:59----------
schematic so our 70 to 60 so that is a

---------13:03----------
resistor that goes from here we go so we

---------13:07----------
have the output of this buck regulator

---------13:10----------
so this buck regulator over here is

---------13:11----------
going to take the 12 volt pulses from

---------13:14----------
the pp bus g3 hot rail it's going to

---------13:16----------
make pulses that go through the inductor

---------13:18----------
and it's three notes with the inductor

---------13:20----------
is gonna do it's gonna take those pulses

---------13:21----------
of twelve point six and zero twelve

---------13:24----------
point six and zero point six and zero

---------13:25----------
and it's gonna smooth it out it's gonna

---------13:27----------
average it into what is going to become

---------13:29----------
five volts so what this does that little

---------13:31----------
resistor it sends a signal back to the u

---------13:34----------
7200 that's pretty much let it know what

---------13:36----------
those pulses are doing so let's see what

---------13:39----------
that resistor looks like so I'm gonna

---------13:41----------
put my multimeter back into resistance

---------13:43----------
mode to measure resistance and I'm gonna

---------13:45----------
check for our 70 to 60 and I want you to

---------13:49----------
pay attention and tell me what it is you

---------13:51----------
see because hopefully we have found the

---------13:54----------
cause of a problem wouldn't that be cool

---------13:57----------
so our 70 to 60 is located right

---------14:00----------
over here and when I look at our 7260

---------14:02----------
and I put the probes of the multimeter

---------14:04----------
to it to measure it instead of getting 0

---------14:06----------
ohms I get o L which is more ohms than I

---------14:11----------
want so let's try replacing that with a

---------14:13----------
resistor from a donor board we're gonna

---------14:15----------
take a donor board that's just like the

---------14:18----------
board that I have here and I'm gonna

---------14:20----------
look at that resistor on a donor board

---------14:22----------
and I'm gonna measure its resistance

---------14:23----------
just to make sure my multimeter is not

---------14:25----------
not broken just to make sure I haven't

---------14:27----------
lost my mind and let's see what I can so

---------14:33----------
if here is on a donor board which I've

---------14:35----------
already apparently stolen a bunch of

---------14:37----------
stuff from what can I say and I get 0

---------14:42----------
ohms so this tells me that I have found

---------14:45----------
the potential cause of my problem so

---------14:48----------
let's continue on to replace that

---------14:50----------
resistor and see what happens and see if

---------14:52----------
we get a working board out of this

---------14:53----------
because there is a good chance at this

---------14:54----------
point that we can't get a working board

---------14:55----------
by simply replacing a simple resistor

---------14:58----------
wouldn't that be cool if we didn't have

---------14:59----------
to do a lot of work and a lot of misery

---------15:02----------
all righty so so we're gonna take that

---------15:08----------
resistor right here

---------15:15----------
goodbye john-boy mmm

---------15:24----------
and I'm gonna take some solder I'm gonna

---------15:31----------
make sure that I'm not running out of

---------15:32----------
disk space I almost forgot to check and

---------15:36----------
see that I'm not running out of disk

---------15:37----------
space that would be smart because I am

---------15:39----------
doing a video in real time I have three

---------15:46----------
hundred twenty five gigabytes left so

---------15:47----------
I'm good now I have three twenty four

---------15:49----------
now I have three twenty three Wow all

---------15:52----------
right so doing two raw video at x264

---------15:58----------
streams in real time is yeah

---------16:02----------
something else that's 60 frames a second

---------16:07----------
so he just put a little Mike alrighty

---------16:12----------
and we are going to take a resistor off

---------16:14----------
here also if enough power went through

---------16:20----------
that resistor to blow it there's a good

---------16:21----------
chance that my chip is blown up as well

---------16:34----------
ah

---------16:41----------
so I might as well replace the chip but

---------16:44----------
I'm curious to see if this on its own

---------16:46----------
solves my issue so let's see what

---------16:50----------
happens I'm gonna plug this in okay and

---------16:55----------
let's see if I got a grip some fan

---------16:57----------
turning on

---------17:03----------
okay so as you can see my fan is now

---------17:06----------
spinning and as we like the joke here

---------17:09----------
because there are many outsourced repair

---------17:11----------
centers that will actually this is this

---------17:13----------
is their testing we are done now

---------17:16----------
seriously there we have a running joke

---------17:17----------
here because there are a couple of

---------17:18----------
outsourced repair centers whose name I

---------17:20----------
am NOT going to mention who they say

---------17:23----------
that they test every board before they

---------17:24----------
send it back but they see the fan spin

---------17:27----------
and then they're done and honestly I've

---------17:29----------
started to understand why that is

---------17:30----------
because you think you've got it and

---------17:31----------
you've solved this problem and it's like

---------17:33----------
oh I'm at the top of how I could

---------17:35----------
possibly feel I couldn't possibly feel

---------17:37----------
any better than how I feel right now

---------17:38----------
so why ruin it by plugging a screen in

---------17:41----------
and seeing that you know there's no CPU

---------17:43----------
vcore that it doesn't work why ruin this

---------17:45----------
beautiful moment by seeing that it works

---------17:47----------
but no unfortunately unfortunately I do

---------17:50----------
provide service to a decent standard of

---------17:51----------
quality which means that I have to

---------17:53----------
actually make sure this thing works

---------17:55----------
before I send it back to the customer

---------17:57----------
which means that yeah I can't just say

---------18:00----------
that them I'm done because I saw the fan

---------18:02----------
spin but that would be cool wouldn't it

---------18:04----------
oh boy that would be cool if I was right

---------18:08----------
done right now

---------18:10----------
so again this is this is the importance

---------18:12----------
of using your brain this is the

---------18:13----------
importance of science isn't the

---------18:14----------
importance of combining science with the

---------18:15----------
basic know-how of just looking at things

---------18:17----------
to get an idea of what's going on

---------18:19----------
because so many people are gonna say

---------18:20----------
replace the chip that makes that voltage

---------18:21----------
the chip wasn't bad the chip was fine

---------18:25----------
there's no reason to replace the chip

---------18:28----------
absolutely no reason to replace the chip

---------18:30----------
when the chip is clearly good so

---------19:24----------
all righty so I have the screen turning

---------19:27----------
on which means my CPU must be good and

---------19:34----------
once I get that question mark folder I

---------19:36----------
will be happy now I'm not gonna run a SD

---------19:38----------
and do all that stuff on camera because

---------19:40----------
frankly that is just a complete and

---------19:42----------
utter waste of bandwidth and video and

---------19:43----------
as you all know who watching this series

---------19:45----------
I do use Time Warner Cable to upload

---------19:48----------
these videos which means that this video

---------19:50----------
if I make it any longer than it is right

---------19:52----------
now will take literally days to upload

---------19:54----------
to YouTube including all the drops and

---------19:55----------
garbage that you get when you pay Time

---------19:57----------
Warner business class cable $175 a month

---------20:00----------
for an internet connection that is worth

---------20:01----------
then the 56k modem that I had when I was

---------20:04----------
12 years old so let's see okay as you

---------20:07----------
can see I have a flashing question mark

---------20:09----------
folder which means obviously most of my

---------20:11----------
functions of my machine are good again

---------20:12----------
we could have issues with current

---------20:14----------
sensing we could have issues with other

---------20:16----------
things but this thing came in totally

---------20:17----------
dead and now it's working so now I can

---------20:19----------
put it in the bin of machines that need

---------20:21----------
testing to make sure that all

---------20:23----------
functionality is okay and I can take it

---------20:25----------
out of the bin of quote unquote

---------20:26----------
completely boards that are

---------20:28----------
sitting on my desk so hopefully you

---------20:30----------
learned something from this hopefully

---------20:31----------
you learned my troubleshooting process a

---------20:33----------
little bit just a little bit of what I

---------20:34----------
go through to figure out what's wrong

---------20:35----------
with the board again I did not I did not

---------20:37----------
do anything to make this look easier

---------20:39----------
than it is I did not start working on it

---------20:41----------
I did not start soldering on it I did

---------20:43----------
not start doing preliminary Diagnostics

---------20:44----------
before I turn the camera on all of this

---------20:46----------
was done in real-time to show you just

---------20:49----------
how simple it can be when you have the

---------20:51----------
right mindset when you're thinking in

---------20:54----------
the right way when you're thinking

---------20:54----------
analytically and when you have the right

---------20:56----------
tools in front of you and when you have

---------20:58----------
the willingness to learn
