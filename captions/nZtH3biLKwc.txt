---------00:00----------
next machine that we have is liquid

---------00:03----------
damage no power so let's open this thing

---------00:05----------
up okay how do we got here 17:08 this is

---------00:09----------
not the touch bar version so we're the

---------00:11----------
same thing applies I'm gonna unplug the

---------00:13----------
battery because I don't want the

---------00:15----------
amperage that the battery is pulling to

---------00:17----------
change my reading of how much amperage

---------00:20----------
the motherboard itself is taking I want

---------00:22----------
to get an idea of just what's going on

---------00:24----------
with the board so I'm gonna open this up

---------00:26----------
so it thinks it's open and plug it in

---------00:29----------
and we're gonna see how many amps this

---------00:31----------
takes and also what voltage we're at so

---------00:33----------
it looks like this is at 5.20 2 volts

---------00:36----------
0.02 amps so we're not even making our

---------00:40----------
way to 20 volts which means we're not

---------00:43----------
doing any negotiating with the charge

---------00:45----------
there's a chip called the CD 32 15 and

---------00:47----------
the CD 32 15 does all of the

---------00:50----------
communication with the charger and that

---------00:52----------
chip requires 3.3 volts BP 3 V 3

---------00:54----------
underscore g3 hot to be present alright

---------00:57----------
we're gonna take a look around the board

---------00:58----------
and oh dear God you and what do you know

---------01:06----------
look at my CD 3215 oh yeah look at that

---------01:15----------
isn't that beautiful

---------01:19----------
that's beautiful

---------01:29----------
let's do it

---------01:38----------
look at that flux flow aim

---------01:57----------
it does John that's also because it's

---------02:00----------
new

---------02:22----------
the board is bleeding a little bit now

---------02:26----------
it is the rest of this disgusting board

---------03:14----------
I still think that there's gonna be an

---------03:16----------
issue under that ship because of how

---------03:18----------
disgusting it was but I'd also like to

---------03:20----------
see if peepee 3v3 underscore g3 hot is

---------03:22----------
present so let's see if we're getting

---------03:23----------
anything on PP 3 v3 underscore g3 hot

---------03:25----------
and we are we're getting PP 3 v3

---------03:29----------
underscore g3 hot but we're still

---------03:32----------
getting 5 volts on this which means that

---------03:34----------
that CD 32 15 is bad or the stuff around

---------03:37----------
it that looked really nasty has probably

---------03:40----------
gotten to us I've gotten to the chip

---------03:43----------
yeah so like this red stuff over here

---------03:46----------
what's this is this worse yeah there's

---------03:48----------
gonna be something talking to something

---------03:50----------
underneath the chip so let's just try

---------03:52----------
and get rid of some of that blood first

---------03:54----------
this is quite a bit of blood there I'm

---------03:56----------
also gonna have to ask Paul where it is

---------03:57----------
that he hides the CD 32 15s because

---------04:01----------
actually wait no I don't because I stole

---------04:02----------
some from my desk just in case he would

---------04:04----------
hide them and run away so I have Paul

---------04:06----------
proof to my setup

---------04:13----------
you always want to make sure that you've

---------04:14----------
Paul proof to your setup so that Paul

---------04:17----------
can hide things from you all right hmm

---------04:24----------
in order to be able to clean that the

---------04:26----------
way I'd like to clean it I'm gonna have

---------04:27----------
to remove that chip so let's go ahead

---------04:30----------
and move

---------05:27----------
Paul Daniels is here Paul Daniels lives

---------05:30----------
in a country where you're not allowed to

---------05:32----------
import three-balled cd32 15s that poor

---------05:35----------
bastard that poor Paul Daniels he

---------05:42----------
doesn't know what freedom is he lives

---------05:45----------
somewhere where they don't know what

---------05:46----------
freedom is

---------05:49----------
let's bring Paul Danielson freedom

---------06:10----------
hmm okay

---------06:26----------
Paul Daniels is here the man is that's

---------06:29----------
going to lose a DotA tonight I've been

---------06:32----------
on a winning streak with dota

---------06:33----------
I've been streaming him a twitch and I

---------06:36----------
am about to kick Paul Daniels assassin

---------06:38----------
some dota I just ripped a pro pad

---------06:47----------
god damn it what was that for mmm

---------06:53----------
what did i do what did I do

---------07:01----------
you a you're not connected how the hell

---------07:05----------
are you not connected

---------07:21----------
thank you

---------07:51----------
all right so this attaches to this and I

---------07:56----------
broke that but here's the funny thing

---------07:58----------
the schematic says NC as in not

---------08:01----------
connected so why would you bother

---------08:04----------
running pathways on the board and

---------08:07----------
creating a pro point and creating a

---------08:09----------
trace and a via that goes to a probe

---------08:12----------
point for something that's not connected

---------08:15----------
that really doesn't make any damn sense

---------08:17----------
this make this this this makes no sense

---------08:20----------
whatsoever

---------08:21----------
I have no idea why they would bother

---------08:23----------
doing that maybe that fresh flux

---------09:07----------
go on a place little chip

---------09:16----------
rest

---------10:06----------
let's see what we get here

---------10:20----------
five point 22 volts and it's not

---------10:23----------
changing

---------10:33----------
five point 22 volts it's taking an extra

---------10:37----------
20 milliamps here but it's still stuck

---------10:41----------
at 5 yep this is no good

---------10:45----------
perhaps our other cd32 15 has problems

---------10:48----------
as well or maybe some of that corroded

---------10:51----------
junk down here actually matters hmm what

---------10:55----------
is all this junk for because this

---------10:59----------
doesn't look any good as you know as

---------11:02----------
nasty as this stuff looks it doesn't

---------11:03----------
look like something that would have

---------11:05----------
actually destroyed anything hmm

---------11:08----------
yeah this is speaker amps that's not

---------11:11----------
something that matters for anything I

---------11:13----------
could give a less about speaker amp

---------11:15----------
perhaps our issues with the other CD

---------11:17----------
32:15

---------13:32----------
my phone for I want an iPhone for where

---------13:36----------
is my iPhone for

---------14:02----------
xyla ten apparently has a lot of money

---------14:15----------
zabba ten sounds like a member of the

---------14:17----------
Genius Bar

---------14:31----------
come on stay on the board

---------15:33----------
don't you try to get away

---------15:46----------
there we go I just saw you fall in a

---------15:49----------
place

---------16:01----------
now you cool

---------16:15----------
the title is self-explanatory wrote a

---------16:17----------
CEO it's actually self-explanatory

---------16:21----------
the title explains itself

---------16:53----------
let's see I have a CS prof basically

---------16:56----------
telling all the students to buy a

---------16:57----------
MacBook Pro because real programmers use

---------16:59----------
macbook so you should get used to them

---------17:01----------
it sounds like we're me we are going to

---------17:04----------
be shown how to do things using Mac

---------17:05----------
specific software thoughts I think that

---------17:08----------
that computer science professor sucks I

---------17:11----------
granted I'm not a programmer but he's

---------17:14----------
telling you that all real programmers

---------17:16----------
use this so you should get this because

---------17:19----------
that's what real programmers use now

---------17:21----------
real programmers use what works for them

---------17:24----------
and if a macbook works for you and

---------17:26----------
you're a real programmer who makes real

---------17:28----------
money then use a macbook if you're a

---------17:30----------
real programmer and you're like paul

---------17:32----------
daniels and you just sit there writing

---------17:34----------
your GPL software using a Stallman

---------17:36----------
created text editor then use that use

---------17:38----------
what works for you but in college what

---------17:41----------
they should be doing is they should be

---------17:42----------
trying to get you to figure out what

---------17:44----------
works for you and they should try to get

---------17:46----------
you in a state where you can think for

---------17:49----------
yourself but college doesn't seem to do

---------17:51----------
that anymore College appears to just

---------17:52----------
kind of tell you what it is you should

---------17:54----------
think and that's one of the reasons I'm

---------17:56----------
not a big fan of college being free

---------17:58----------
because college seems to be less about

---------18:00----------
teaching you how to think and more about

---------18:03----------
telling you what to think and I don't

---------18:05----------
think that's good at all and I'm not a

---------18:08----------
big fan of it aha 20 volts here we go 20

---------18:11----------
volts 2 milliamps look at that so we've

---------18:15----------
made some progress here see that 20

---------18:18----------
volts but it's only taking two milliamps

---------18:20----------
which means it's not turning on that's

---------18:22----------
no good what's his Stallman says paul

---------18:25----------
brian richard stallman is Paul Daniels

---------18:28----------
is biological uncle he taught him

---------18:32----------
everything he knows and how to engineer

---------18:34----------
software

---------18:35----------
yeah so we are getting 20 volts now but

---------18:38----------
it's taking twenty or two yeah that

---------18:41----------
that's 20 milliamps all right so now we

---------18:44----------
have to figure out why this board is not

---------18:46----------
turning itself on so we fixed our first

---------18:48----------
problem and now most certainly we're

---------18:51----------
going to have secondary issues and other

---------18:54----------
things as well so the first thing I'm

---------18:56----------
gonna do is go through some basic power

---------18:58----------
rails on this MacBook while I'm waiting

---------19:00----------
for the ultrasonic cleaner to heat up

---------19:02----------
because I imagine the ultrasonic cleaner

---------19:03----------
is going to help me with this

---------19:06----------
this is one of those boards that's nasty

---------19:07----------
enough that I would use the ultrasonic

---------19:09----------
cleaner on it

---------19:09----------
pp bus P P bus PPP PPP bus

---------19:20----------
so our P P bus is 0.6 volts that doesn't

---------19:25----------
sound like a healthy PP bus hmmm is pp

---------19:30----------
bus shorted 55 ohms yeah that's a

---------19:38----------
shorted little pp bus what could be

---------19:41----------
shorting our pp bus to ground here's

---------19:43----------
where our pp buses we're going a solder

---------19:46----------
or wire from the power supply to our pp

---------19:49----------
bus and then we're going to inject

---------19:52----------
voltage into our pp bus see what gets

---------19:54----------
hot this is not a very sexy-looking

---------19:58----------
solder joint at all but it's fine it'll

---------20:01----------
do because this is just a testing solder

---------20:04----------
joint to inject voltage into the board

---------20:06----------
to see what it is that gets hot along

---------20:08----------
our pp bus and at this point you can

---------20:12----------
probably tell that I'm just looking for

---------20:14----------
excuses to continue saying pp bus B P

---------20:18----------
bus P P bus all along the P P bus let's

---------20:24----------
get started and inject some voltage into

---------20:27----------
that P P bus and see what it is that

---------20:28----------
gets hot on my board we're gonna start

---------20:33----------
with point 5 volts and we'll go up a

---------20:36----------
little bit from there

---------20:44----------
and it looks like whatever was getting

---------20:46----------
warm just burned its way out because

---------20:49----------
it's no longer getting warm interesting

---------20:52----------
did our short circuit just magically

---------20:54----------
disappear it looks like it did Wow

---------21:03----------
yeah 12 point 5 volts we're taking 0.001

---------21:07----------
amps Wow looks like measure whatever was

---------21:14----------
short-circuited just burned itself out

---------21:16----------
right in front of me damn short circuit

---------21:21----------
has burned its way out of the board

---------21:22----------
automatically I wonder if our pp bus

---------21:25----------
will be present now

---------21:35----------
maybe let's see what it is we get on the

---------21:38----------
multimeter let's measure our pp buses

---------21:44----------
resistance to ground and it's going up

---------21:51----------
to kill ohms so before we add 60 to 50

---------21:53----------
to 60 ohms and now we're getting 2900

---------21:55----------
three thousand ohms thirty five hundred

---------21:57----------
ohms and up it goes so it looks like our

---------22:01----------
short was something that it was

---------22:02----------
intermittent I got blown up interesting

---------22:06----------
alright let's see what happens when we

---------22:08----------
plug in a charger so when we plug in a

---------22:10----------
charger five point 22 volts here we go

---------22:15----------
twenty volts 400 MLM six hundred

---------22:18----------
milliamps so now it looks like this is

---------22:20----------
actually turning on check it out folks

---------22:23----------
we've got CPU v core look at that that's

---------22:29----------
CPU V core this is a Macbook board

---------22:35----------
that's turning on

---------22:41----------
that's beautiful that's a high peepee

---------22:45----------
bus well looks like we solved our

---------22:51----------
problem first we had an issue where the

---------22:55----------
cd32 15s which are supposed to talk to

---------22:58----------
the charger and negotiate the USBC

---------22:59----------
charge of being 20 volts instead of 5

---------23:01----------
volts weren't working due to heavy

---------23:03----------
corrosion we replaced one but it still

---------23:05----------
didn't work so then we replaced the

---------23:07----------
other one interestingly enough they were

---------23:08----------
both Kura bad even the one that was not

---------23:10----------
really corroded after we did that it

---------23:13----------
still wasn't turning on and when we

---------23:14----------
checked our PP bus g3 hot PP bus g3 HOD

---------23:17----------
had a 50 to 60 ohms short to ground we

---------23:20----------
injected voltage in there to try and

---------23:22----------
figure out what it was that was shorting

---------23:23----------
it to ground and the moment we injected

---------23:25----------
voltage it immediately stopped being

---------23:27----------
short circuited just to make sure it

---------23:29----------
wasn't some sort of intermittent

---------23:30----------
trolling short I up the voltage all the

---------23:32----------
way to 12 point 5 volts and left it

---------23:34----------
there for a while and it still didn't

---------23:37----------
take any amperage so I think all this

---------23:39----------
thing's gonna need now that it's getting

---------23:40----------
CPU v horn turning on is a nice thorough

---------23:43----------
cleaning in the ultrasonic to get rid of

---------23:45----------
any junk on the board that's gonna be

---------23:46----------
causing shorts or bridges that's going

---------23:48----------
to keep it from working and to get rid

---------23:50----------
of any corrosion unto the chips after

---------23:51----------
that it should be set and ready to go

---------23:54----------
and if you want a Macbook fix like this

---------23:56----------
hand it over to send your MacBook Calm

---------23:58----------
we offer repair services and more so

---------24:02----------
this is the original board that I was

---------24:04----------
working on earlier if you just take a

---------24:06----------
look at what it looks like after the

---------24:07----------
ultrasonic cleaning this is our CD 3215

---------24:10----------
area that was the corroded not connected

---------24:13----------
pad
