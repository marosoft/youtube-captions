---------00:00----------
okay so today we're going to be going

---------00:01----------
over a no backlight board it's a month

---------00:03----------
MacBook Air I want to go over a little

---------00:05----------
bit of how you can kind of figure out

---------00:06----------
where the faults may lie so one of the

---------00:09----------
things I like to do is I like to take

---------00:11----------
the multimeter put it in diode mode put

---------00:13----------
red probe on ground and put black probe

---------00:16----------
on back light output and over here I get

---------00:18----------
point five seven two now on a working

---------00:21----------
board that is backlight I usually get

---------00:23----------
point five one nine two point five four

---------00:26----------
six when it's an LP 8550 base board what

---------00:29----------
I mean by LP 8550 based is that the

---------00:31----------
backlight circuitry is based on the LP

---------00:34----------
8550 chipset so if I were to move over

---------00:37----------
to the schematic over here after I close

---------00:39----------
out of all the personal stuff I don't

---------00:42----------
want you seeing on my monitor

---------00:47----------
you're going to see this

---------00:50----------
you

---------00:52----------
so this is what I mean when I say LP

---------00:55----------
8550 based this is the LCD backlight

---------00:58----------
driver and when i zoom in ahem when i

---------01:02----------
zoom in okay I guess Adobe just doesn't

---------01:06----------
want me to zoom in today so whatever it

---------01:08----------
says LP 8550 I know YouTube probably

---------01:10----------
sodomize it you probably can't see that

---------01:12----------
I don't know why my PDF reader is not

---------01:17----------
allowing me to zoom today and I'm just

---------01:21----------
too tired to fight it and find out why

---------01:26----------
yeah no clue but yeah that's this is an

---------01:30----------
LP 8550 baseboard and that's what I have

---------01:32----------
so first thing I'm going to do is run it

---------01:43----------
through the ultrasonic cleaner this

---------01:45----------
board came from a place I've been

---------01:47----------
telling them to buy an ultrasonic

---------01:48----------
cleaner for the past year and a half

---------01:50----------
they have not and so the LED driver

---------01:53----------
which looks just fine but right next to

---------01:55----------
the LED driver you have some of that so

---------01:58----------
I'm pretty sure that this was liquid

---------01:59----------
damaged and before I even bother

---------02:02----------
replacing stuff I'm going to make sure

---------02:04----------
that it's cleaned off so we toss it in

---------02:07----------
the Machine and

---------02:14----------
from there and see see what we get

---------02:19----------
alright so this has been run through the

---------02:21----------
ultrasonic cleaner and now that it was

---------02:23----------
run through the ultrasonic we are going

---------02:25----------
to get to work so that did not fix the

---------02:28----------
no backlight issue it still has no

---------02:29----------
backlight on the LCD and my diode mode

---------02:32----------
measurements that of being what it was

---------02:34----------
supposed to be which is between point

---------02:35----------
five one nine and point five four six I

---------02:37----------
had something like I think point five

---------02:39----------
six one just double-check and see if

---------02:41----------
that's still the case point five seven

---------02:44----------
four so here's the cool part about diode

---------02:47----------
mode measurements and you know it's like

---------02:50----------
a resistance measurement when it comes

---------02:52----------
to checking resistances in a circuit to

---------02:55----------
ground but instead of taking forever

---------02:57----------
it just happens like that it's like

---------02:59----------
thing and what you can start doing is

---------03:00----------
you can start associating certain

---------03:01----------
numbers with certain problems so for

---------03:03----------
example I know to associate if the

---------03:05----------
feedback via is blown so let me just

---------03:07----------
bring up the schematic here so that I

---------03:09----------
could show you what it is I'm talking

---------03:10----------
about look at that my PDF here oh let me

---------03:13----------
zoom it again nevermind

---------03:15----------
spoke too soon so for example I've

---------03:17----------
noticed that if this is blown from d7

---------03:20----------
701 to the feedback pin of the LP 8550

---------03:25----------
that my measurement is going to be

---------03:27----------
something like 0.45 32.5 11 I've noticed

---------03:32----------
that if this switch part is broken so

---------03:35----------
from here to here is broken that my

---------03:37----------
measurement is going to be something

---------03:38----------
like point five five zero two point six

---------03:42----------
if I've noticed that if this chip is

---------03:46----------
internally broken and shorted to ground

---------03:48----------
completely that I'll have a point zero

---------03:50----------
zero one or point zero zero seven or if

---------03:52----------
the LCD connector is a short side of it

---------03:54----------
if it's point two five six or something

---------03:56----------
like that then I also know that it's the

---------03:58----------
LP 8550 and the way I know this is

---------04:00----------
because every single time I have a

---------04:01----------
problem I measure it using the diode

---------04:03----------
mode measurements and what I do is I

---------04:05----------
make an association in my head with

---------04:06----------
whatever it is that I found

---------04:07----------
so again feedback so when I see feedback

---------04:10----------
via is not working before I'll actually

---------04:11----------
fix it I'll measure it and then I'll

---------04:13----------
have that my head so that for the next

---------04:15----------
time when I start troubleshooting a

---------04:16----------
circuit that has an issue I can just

---------04:18----------
measure it you know just get a general

---------04:20----------
idea what it is I have to do so here I'm

---------04:22----------
pretty sure that the switch portion of

---------04:23----------
the chip is bad you're not going to be

---------04:26----------
reusing that chip anyway so we do

---------04:28----------
here turn on the fume extractor since

---------04:30----------
again I don't want to get myself any

---------04:32----------
horrible diseases

---------04:33----------
inhaling solder all day

---------04:37----------
I'm going to get my spool of chips

---------04:39----------
because as I tell you you should always

---------04:41----------
stock things that you're going to use

---------04:42----------
regularly and you do need to stock this

---------04:46----------
stuff love still being sick and we're

---------04:53----------
going to get started so hopefully my

---------04:54----------
microscope setup is working come on

---------04:57----------
there we go and we're going to replace

---------05:02----------
this little thing I really got I wonder

---------05:10----------
if those like marks on it is that actual

---------05:13----------
dirt because I've compressed there that

---------05:14----------
stuff out before is that actual dirt or

---------05:17----------
is that just like permanent scratches I

---------05:20----------
guess I'll find out later one of these

---------05:25----------
days I'll get around to cleaning on the

---------05:26----------
inside of the trinocular port of the

---------05:28----------
microscope

---------05:43----------
look a little sadder ball

---------06:09----------
you

---------07:15----------
now I shouldn't use that tip to begin

---------07:17----------
with that's not the really the right one

---------07:19----------
when you use this flat tip over here to

---------07:22----------
do the wicking did anybody ask you to

---------07:28----------
beep did anybody ask if you could beep

---------07:32----------
anybody say it was okay for you to beep

---------07:36----------
if you beep even one more time if you

---------07:39----------
try to beep if you try to beep even one

---------07:44----------
more effing time oh you're gonna get it

---------07:50----------
you are gonna get it you're

---------07:53----------
gonna so hack go make some annoying

---------07:56----------
product sometimes Sharky never beeps Zam

---------08:02----------
out doesn't beep that looks like crud

---------08:17----------
you're going to use the most

---------08:19----------
professional cleaning tool there is

---------08:20----------
which is the end of my index finger a

---------08:23----------
cheap Amazon comm paper towel and some

---------08:27----------
alcohol

---------08:35----------
oh yeah that's how you do it oh I can't

---------08:47----------
wait to see the trolls that I get on

---------08:48----------
this one

---------08:49----------
people are gonna scream there's

---------08:55----------
no es de protection you can be knocking

---------08:59----------
off the resistors oh my god oh my

---------09:02----------
profession no you you know a

---------09:08----------
professional is it got here ten minutes

---------09:11----------
ago it'll be fixed ten minutes from now

---------09:14----------
and I'll never be back that's

---------09:16----------
professional really when you know what

---------09:30----------
you're doing you can do things the way

---------09:31----------
you want when you don't know what you're

---------09:33----------
doing doesn't matter if you follow a

---------09:35----------
guide or a manual it will all come out

---------09:37----------
super up I know I've been there

---------09:48----------
okay so what's this talking about over

---------09:50----------
here I'm not really happy with that

---------09:55----------
Oh

---------10:04----------
is this is a 34:37

---------10:21----------
Oh your ground I don't care about that

---------10:34----------
you'll be fine

---------10:36----------
I see you got ground over there already

---------10:39----------
here why am I even driving myself nuts

---------10:42----------
over nothing

---------10:43----------
alrighty now we're gonna put flux oh my

---------10:48----------
that's too much flux oh no it's not

---------10:51----------
gonna work now No oh hey get the

---------11:05----------
balls get the flux on the board make

---------11:07----------
sure it's all nice and flexy flex itty

---------11:10----------
flexed and for the

---------11:18----------
during times so I had my hot air station

---------11:20----------
with a lower so that'll be enough to

---------11:22----------
blow away the excess flux that I can see

---------11:25----------
stuff and by the time it heats up I'll

---------11:27----------
be ready to saddle my chip because the

---------11:29----------
excess flux will be blown away now once

---------11:38----------
it melts in a place it's going to be

---------11:40----------
like kind of moving back and forth

---------11:41----------
that's what I'm looking for

---------11:54----------
that's what I was looking for back

---------11:55----------
my hot air station actually worked and

---------11:57----------
wasn't a piece of let's see if that

---------12:02----------
melted I can't trust that's the thing

---------12:04----------
even your tools suck you can't trust

---------12:05----------
them anymore I used to just trust it I

---------12:08----------
saw it move back and forth well that

---------12:11----------
ain't melted for well that's awful

---------12:14----------
that's I may just go on and buy myself

---------12:20----------
one of those pacer well er once today

---------12:22----------
because I can't deal with this whole hot

---------12:24----------
air station being a piece of thing

---------12:26----------
alright this is by the way this supposed

---------12:29----------
to be easy job it really is like

---------12:31----------
this is this is a great example of why

---------12:33----------
you don't buy crap tools so even though

---------12:35----------
this is not a crap tool this is an

---------12:36----------
expensive hack Oh tool it's working like

---------12:38----------
an IOU right now this is what happens

---------12:41----------
when you buy Iowa remember how I said it

---------12:43----------
you're supposed to start moving back and

---------12:44----------
forth and that's how you'll know that

---------12:46----------
you're good never started moving back

---------12:48----------
and forth because it never heated up

---------12:49----------
enough here you go so see it kind of

---------12:58----------
moved in a place there and when I move

---------13:01----------
the iron back and forth you can see the

---------13:03----------
chip dancing is the other chip is kind

---------13:04----------
of dancing that's how you know that the

---------13:07----------
balls are liquidus you want the balls to

---------13:09----------
be liquidus for a decent amount of time

---------13:10----------
because almost all the balls can be

---------13:12----------
liquidus but the center balls that are

---------13:14----------
hard to get to cannot be liquidus and if

---------13:15----------
they're not liquid is that you didn't

---------13:17----------
really do anything see that's the way

---------13:20----------
they're supposed to look so you got to

---------13:22----------
see what it's like to solder with an

---------13:23----------
Iowa station and then you got to see

---------13:25----------
what it's like to solder with a hako

---------13:26----------
station even though this is not acting

---------13:27----------
like a hackle in one of the points that

---------13:29----------
I keep trying to get across in this

---------13:30----------
channel I don't want to just show you

---------13:31----------
how to do the work right I want to show

---------13:33----------
you how it gets done wrong so that you

---------13:35----------
know what to avoid it because that's

---------13:37----------
that's something that I really wish had

---------13:39----------
happened with me cuz like you know I

---------13:41----------
don't need to just know how to do it

---------13:43----------
right I need to know what's wrong I need

---------13:45----------
to know what to avoid doing just as much

---------13:47----------
as I need to know what I should be doing

---------13:50----------
nobody really points that stuff out

---------13:53----------
because they're kind of afraid to like

---------13:55----------
even everyone everybody just kind of

---------13:57----------
thinks that you should just look like

---------13:58----------
you're a genius and everything goes

---------14:00----------
perfectly all the time how dare we be

---------14:02----------
unprofessional and show something that

---------14:04----------
isn't absolutely perfect I don't give a

---------14:06----------
 if you know somebody trolls is like

---------14:08----------
you're unprofessional

---------14:09----------
this doesn't that's not perfect or blah

---------14:12----------
blah blah well like everything you do it

---------14:14----------
comes out perfect like your

---------14:15----------
tools work 100% all the time like you

---------14:17----------
have all the time in the world like

---------14:19----------
you've never made a mistake

---------14:20----------
no you're human just like me I'm sorry

---------14:24----------
to tell you you are you are you make

---------14:27----------
mistakes your day doesn't always go

---------14:29----------
perfectly your boards don't always come

---------14:32----------
out working you sometimes have to go

---------14:34----------
back in because you get you thought it

---------14:36----------
was one thing and I want to being

---------14:37----------
another you get bad chipsets in the mail

---------14:39----------
and the DHL just like I do like you know

---------14:46----------
you're all human just like me and this

---------14:49----------
channel is meant for humans not for a

---------14:53----------
little like robots then brainiacs

---------14:59----------
channel is for regular people that want

---------15:02----------
to learn something I might as well

---------15:08----------
diode mode measurement with the new chip

---------15:10----------
it's going to be a little up

---------15:11----------
because the chips never had any power

---------15:12----------
run through it before so let's see what

---------15:15----------
I get

---------15:15----------
Oh point five one four so I said that

---------15:19----------
I'm used to it being between point five

---------15:21----------
one nine and point five four six point

---------15:25----------
five one four is much closer to that

---------15:26----------
than point five seven two and point six

---------15:29----------
like I was getting before

---------15:49----------
the next video I do you'll most likely

---------15:51----------
see a new hot air station on my desk

---------15:53----------
because by then I will probably have

---------15:55----------
tossed net FR 801 out of window that's

---------16:00----------
the proper burial for it I mean really

---------16:01----------
the thing is given me about I don't

---------16:04----------
remember exactly when I bought it I

---------16:05----------
think it's given me about like good six

---------16:06----------
years of loyal loyal honest service and

---------16:10----------
people have said like open it and chest

---------16:13----------
test the cable do this that and the

---------16:14----------
other and here's I know this is again

---------16:16----------
this is legitimately stupid like I'm not

---------16:18----------
even gonna come criticize you for

---------16:20----------
telling me I'm stupid for saying this

---------16:21----------
but I hate fixing tools I really do like

---------16:24----------
I know it sounds silly but I I would

---------16:27----------
rather have I'd rather just pay more

---------16:29----------
money to get stuff to get all the stuff

---------16:31----------
in my desk to actually work then have to

---------16:33----------
think about fixing tools because I have

---------16:35----------
a certain amount of brain power in my

---------16:38----------
day in patients that I can put towards

---------16:40----------
towards figuring this stuff out and I

---------16:42----------
really don't like wasting it on

---------16:44----------
something that has just no return like I

---------16:47----------
fixed the hacker what I can't you know

---------16:49----------
nobody's gonna pay me for that oh so

---------16:54----------
replacing the element I put off for a

---------16:55----------
decent amount of time but yeah I hate

---------16:57----------
fixing tools I really do because then if

---------17:00----------
you fix the tool and you up fixing

---------17:01----------
the tool in

---------17:03----------
then you know you wasted time and it

---------17:06----------
doesn't work and and it's never gonna

---------17:09----------
work the way it used to and that I'd I

---------17:12----------
have honest agents it really comes down

---------17:13----------
to luck I mean I have just such bad luck

---------17:15----------
when it comes to repairing my own tools

---------17:17----------
it's awful it's a joke anyway so the

---------17:21----------
diode mode measurement is what I want it

---------17:23----------
to be and I have a light I obviously got

---------17:26----------
to cover the user name because as I've

---------17:28----------
learned you guys really like to stalk

---------17:30----------
people when I leave names up there so

---------17:33----------
there give a light shining apple the

---------17:40----------
Apple is shining but I can't show you

---------17:42----------
because there's a label back there and

---------17:43----------
that this camera zoomed in a little too

---------17:45----------
good so you'll see it but yeah that's

---------17:47----------
that so diode mode measurements make it

---------17:49----------
really really easy to get an idea of

---------17:51----------
what's wrong what's going on and what to

---------17:53----------
do to fix it again if my diode mode

---------17:54----------
measurement there was point five four

---------17:56----------
four I probably would look somewhere

---------17:58----------
about the lp 8550 maybe I would have

---------18:01----------
looked for the enable circuitry maybe I

---------18:02----------
would have looked for another PWM signal

---------18:05----------
missing but when you know what to look

---------18:07----------
for and when you have these measurements

---------18:08----------
in your head for all the different

---------18:10----------
circuits it makes it easy is this chip

---------18:12----------
pulling this down is that you're pulling

---------18:14----------
this down is this line missing is that

---------18:15----------
line missing diode one measurement get a

---------18:18----------
good multimeter get a nice multimeter if

---------18:20----------
you want to be able to have measurements

---------18:21----------
that are close too close to mine you can

---------18:24----------
get a fluke 15b expect to pay about a

---------18:26----------
hundred bucks for it get the fine probes

---------18:28----------
for an extra fifteen or thirty bucks on

---------18:30----------
Amazon to put on them you know I don't

---------18:32----------
have the model number in front of me and

---------18:34----------
everybody's going to ask and I'm going

---------18:35----------
to forget to put it here but you'll find

---------18:37----------
you just like find these fine tip probes

---------18:39----------
see these have a number on them of

---------18:43----------
course they don't why would you put a

---------18:44----------
number on it when it would make it

---------18:46----------
useful for reordering but yeah makes it

---------18:49----------
a lot easier you know some people have

---------18:51----------
like you know soldered needles on to it

---------18:55----------
that's just a chit sounds like torture

---------18:57----------
when you can buy that crap for fifteen

---------18:59----------
bucks but yeah that's it for today so

---------19:01----------
board was dead board had no backlight

---------19:04----------
board has back line I talked a little

---------19:05----------
bit about how I did the estimate how I

---------19:07----------
figured out I talked a little bit about

---------19:09----------
how I determined that the chip was the

---------19:11----------
problem how I use measurements to

---------19:13----------
determine that the chip is the problem

---------19:14----------
you saw me solder it

---------19:15----------
you saw the improper way to

---------19:17----------
you saw what you're most likely doing if

---------19:19----------
you have a $50 higher station than you

---------19:21----------
saw what's gonna happen you have a good

---------19:22----------
hot air station again the thing is even

---------19:24----------
when it wasn't melting the chip on

---------19:26----------
properly one of the things you probably

---------19:27----------
noticed is that it was melting solder

---------19:28----------
the components around the chip we're

---------19:30----------
actually getting hot you can see that

---------19:31----------
they were liquid is but the itself was

---------19:33----------
now and that's the thing with bad that's

---------19:34----------
the thing with bad tools that's the

---------19:36----------
thing about when tools don't work

---------19:37----------
because you're gonna think it's you

---------19:38----------
you're gonna think it's your method

---------19:40----------
you're not going to think that it's the

---------19:41----------
shitty tool because again it was slow

---------19:43----------
roasting everything and that's not what

---------19:44----------
you want you don't want hot air to slow

---------19:46----------
roast things you want hot air to be like

---------19:48----------
sort of flamethrower we're in

---------19:50----------
this specific spot you're just you give

---------19:51----------
you dislike owning it with heat like I

---------19:54----------
usually have things set to really high

---------19:56----------
heat and I just controlled my hand like

---------19:58----------
I don't control temperature by going in

---------19:59----------
the irony going I want 740 degrees now

---------20:03----------
instead of 650 degrees now no I do this

---------20:06----------
I want 650 oh I want 750 oh I want 800

---------20:10----------
like you know eat it's just how close

---------20:11----------
you to the board and you get this feel

---------20:13----------
for your tools when you have a good tool

---------20:14----------
you know exactly what the temperature

---------20:16----------
supposed to be so that yeah that's how I

---------20:18----------
know when it's soldered when I see it

---------20:19----------
when I when it moves in a place that's

---------20:21----------
great then what moves in a place I go

---------20:23----------
closer and then I move it around and

---------20:24----------
when I see that the chip is dancing I
