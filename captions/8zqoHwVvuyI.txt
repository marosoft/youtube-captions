---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's everything going

---------00:02----------
today so I'm gonna get started with

---------00:03----------
another MacBook Board repair for you all

---------00:06----------
hopefully you all enjoy today we're

---------00:09----------
gonna be getting started on the show

---------00:10----------
with an A 1502 that has no power we're

---------00:13----------
gonna open this thing up we're gonna

---------00:14----------
figure out it what's wrong with it if we

---------00:16----------
can figure out what's wrong with I'll

---------00:17----------
explain our thought process and what was

---------00:20----------
actually wrong with it on camera so that

---------00:22----------
you can have a better idea how to do

---------00:24----------
these types of repairs let's get started

---------00:29----------
open this thing up looks like it's been

---------00:32----------
somebody used packing tape to hold it in

---------00:35----------
which is really annoying very very

---------00:41----------
annoying

---------01:08----------
so first thing that I like to do with

---------01:11----------
any of these machines and see how much

---------01:12----------
power it's taking using the power supply

---------01:14----------
the power supply is going to tell me how

---------01:17----------
many amps it's using and that's going to

---------01:19----------
give me an idea of what's actually wrong

---------01:21----------
with the machine we're gonna turn on the

---------01:22----------
multimeter and power supply software

---------01:25----------
here award-winning world acclaimed

---------01:30----------
multimeter software from mr. Paul

---------01:33----------
Daniels all right we're taking 20

---------01:34----------
milliamps we have a green light

---------01:36----------
20 milliamps is usually a way to signal

---------01:40----------
that the p.m. sleeve s4l is missing

---------01:43----------
which is great now it looks like we got

---------01:44----------
corrosion in the area that responsible

---------01:46----------
for creating P P bus d3 hot so the next

---------01:48----------
thing I want to do is see if we can

---------01:49----------
match d3 Hunt is actually being created

---------01:51----------
let's take a look and see - d3 hot on

---------01:55----------
this board I do believe is gonna be

---------01:57----------
located on this white fuse down here and

---------02:00----------
for those of you following along at home

---------02:02----------
that are not used to me working on this

---------02:04----------
board who don't really understand why it

---------02:05----------
is I'm checking for that power rail well

---------02:07----------
that's a great question that you've got

---------02:09----------
it's the why I'm checking for that power

---------02:10----------
rail let's go over it really quickly

---------02:12----------
before I move on to then - checking that

---------02:15----------
power line so I'm gonna open up the

---------02:16----------
schematic and board view for an 8 - 0 -

---------02:19----------
49 24 board so that you can all see and

---------02:23----------
follow along with me now what I have

---------02:25----------
over here is board view software that's

---------02:27----------
opening the board of the wrong

---------02:28----------
orientation but besides that we have you

---------02:31----------
7100 is the chip that it's got some junk

---------02:35----------
around it and this is battery charger

---------02:38----------
it's gonna create my pp bus g3 Hunt

---------02:40----------
right over there see that BP bus so I'm

---------02:44----------
checking on F 7140 where it creates that

---------02:46----------
let's see what we get one point one

---------02:49----------
volts and look at that well now if you

---------02:55----------
take a look at the schematic and you

---------02:56----------
know what that's supposed to be well one

---------02:57----------
of the ways that I used to do this is I

---------02:59----------
would just check it on a known good

---------03:00----------
board that was my foolproof way of

---------03:02----------
figuring out the way things are supposed

---------03:04----------
to be but if you are kind of you know

---------03:07----------
you want a way to tell that's a little

---------03:08----------
bit more foolproof that's completely

---------03:11----------
understandable what you can do is you

---------03:14----------
can check on the schematic itself now

---------03:18----------
they used to have this list of power

---------03:19----------
rails right in the beginning

---------03:20----------
to make it nice and easy on folks but

---------03:21----------
now they put the most important part of

---------03:23----------
the schematic on page 68 because Apple

---------03:25----------
pp bus g3 huh

---------03:27----------
it says 8.6 volts now this is another

---------03:30----------
part where the schematic is not going to

---------03:31----------
be very helpful because this machine is

---------03:33----------
actually supposed to have eight point

---------03:35----------
twelve point six volts not eight point

---------03:38----------
six volts one of the ways that you can

---------03:39----------
tell this is by checking the voltage and

---------03:40----------
a known good battery this is eight point

---------03:43----------
six that's actually for a MacBook Air so

---------03:45----------
this appala schematic gets its own

---------03:46----------
voltage wrong it doesn't know it at once

---------03:48----------
this is supposed to be eight point at

---------03:51----------
twelve point six so the schematic here

---------03:52----------
is actually wrong and this is where

---------03:53----------
having a known good board can actually

---------03:55----------
be more helpful than checking certain

---------03:57----------
things in the schematic because

---------03:58----------
sometimes in the schematic itself can be

---------04:00----------
wrong so let's take a look on the board

---------04:04----------
and see if we can just fix this issue

---------04:05----------
with a little bit of hot air and flux

---------04:10----------
before I even get into doing the hot air

---------04:12----------
and flux thing I'd like to see what that

---------04:13----------
specific resistor that's messed up is

---------04:15----------
actually for

---------04:28----------
charger dcn and charger a gate all right

---------04:32----------
so that resistor over there

---------04:35----------
it's supposed to be 332 kilohms and I'm

---------04:40----------
pretty sure it is I would wager a guess

---------04:42----------
that the issue here is not going to have

---------04:44----------
anything to do with the with the

---------04:49----------
resistor being bad and everything to do

---------04:50----------
with the is l6 to 5/9 being bad see 331

---------04:57----------
kilohms so that's it supposed to be 3

---------05:00----------
into 32 kilo ohms that's not really

---------05:01----------
gonna be what bothers me here the issue

---------05:05----------
is gonna be a bad is all six two five

---------05:06----------
nine I'm gonna guess that's the chip

---------05:08----------
that's wrong so let's give that a

---------05:10----------
replacement and see if it fixes our

---------05:12----------
problem

---------05:15----------
put a little bit of flux over there not

---------05:17----------
too much not too little so we're gonna

---------05:20----------
replace our ISO 65 9 have a proper board

---------05:38----------
100% Randy hundred-percent

---------05:42----------
it did that before I bought that freakin

---------05:45----------
switch that tp-link is only about a year

---------05:47----------
old

---------05:56----------
yeah wasn't the ironworks so much better

---------05:58----------
when you turn it on

---------06:10----------
all right

---------06:15----------
the inspection was horrible

---------06:20----------
can I get the audio file for robust

---------06:22----------
robust

---------07:41----------
we gots for the new story your stress

---------07:43----------
level back to normal soon

---------07:44----------
thank you yeah it's been very stressful

---------07:47----------
recently it's been stressful on

---------07:50----------
everybody really everybody's had a lot

---------07:53----------
to do it's gonna be even more stressful

---------07:57----------
on Paul since he just went on vacation

---------07:58----------
to Vegas and he's going to be staying at

---------08:00----------
a hotel where they have lots of gambling

---------08:03----------
[ __ ] right downstairs

---------08:16----------
that is nice and crooked

---------08:30----------
from one thing Panthers easiest to

---------08:32----------
another cape of the great work dear some

---------08:34----------
fishing for future streams

---------08:37----------
maybe thank you

---------08:49----------
this is my donor over here we're gonna

---------08:53----------
let this dry by utilizing rapid cool

---------08:56----------
technology its rapid cool technology

---------09:06----------
eighteen million

---------09:07----------
no difference no change okay now we got

---------09:11----------
to do a little bit of investigating

---------09:14----------
still one volt on PP bus g3 hot next

---------09:17----------
time

---------09:17----------
do we have a short two grounds on PP bus

---------09:19----------
g3 huh not short to ground six million

---------09:23----------
ohms fuse is good yeah okay

---------09:39----------
current sense

---------09:52----------
Karen sends good here occurrence ends

---------09:54----------
good there hmm let's see that I forget

---------10:00----------
how to solder maybe I forgot it a solder

---------10:09----------
that's always possible never know all

---------10:13----------
right so let's see is the charger even

---------10:15----------
turning on so we have Q 70 180 over here

---------10:17----------
this is the inrush transistor and one

---------10:20----------
thing I'm kind of curious to see is do

---------10:22----------
we have voltage over here at the

---------10:24----------
beginning so let's just check in voltage

---------10:26----------
mode

---------10:34----------
let's check on okay so like right over

---------10:38----------
here what do we get so do we have 20

---------10:41----------
volts coming into the machine 18 I

---------10:43----------
suppose

---------10:51----------
18 comes in very good all right so now

---------10:54----------
we have this thing over here I want to

---------10:57----------
see what's coming out of the transistor

---------11:05----------
Oh for [ __ ] sake oh that's the pintu

---------11:10----------
I'm hitting ground like a dumbass

---------11:12----------
it's measure here yeah so one ball comes

---------11:17----------
out of the transistor now the question

---------11:18----------
is is the transistor being asked to open

---------11:20----------
because you know I can't really blame

---------11:23----------
this transistor for not opening if it's

---------11:24----------
not being asked to so what you have

---------11:25----------
going on here is this is the 18 volts

---------11:29----------
from the charger and there's a resistor

---------11:31----------
between the 18 volts from the charger

---------11:32----------
that goes to the source of the

---------11:33----------
transistor and 18 volts of the charger

---------11:35----------
going to the gate of the transistor

---------11:36----------
which means that this p channel is never

---------11:38----------
going to open this is only going to open

---------11:40----------
if the vultures on the gate is less than

---------11:43----------
the voltage in the source however you

---------11:45----------
have this other resistor R 70 186 that

---------11:47----------
goes between the gate and ground but

---------11:48----------
before it gets the ground that goes

---------11:49----------
through 70 100 so you 7100 can control

---------11:52----------
whether this transistor opens by

---------11:53----------
allowing or not allowing this to go to

---------11:56----------
ground this wood becomes a voltage

---------11:57----------
divider if the bottom of our 71 86 here

---------12:00----------
is allowed to go to ground and then

---------12:03----------
you'll have less voltage in the gate

---------12:04----------
than the source envelope and so let's

---------12:06----------
take a look at our 71 86 and see what's

---------12:07----------
present on pin 2 our 71 86 pin 2 is

---------12:12----------
gonna be there

---------12:18----------
and he had 16 volts the u 7000 is not

---------12:22----------
telling this transistor to open that's

---------12:25----------
why it's stuck let's see

---------12:33----------
17 here 16 there

---------12:54----------
all right let's check some other stuff

---------12:56----------
going on here so why isn't you 7100

---------12:58----------
doing his job you 7100 is not sending

---------13:00----------
that to ground

---------13:01----------
let's see what's present is our 70 105

---------13:04----------
good where did you blow all right 70 105

---------13:09----------
is gonna supply power and charger DC in

---------13:11----------
supposed to be 20 ohms and your 20 ohms

---------13:19----------
that's not it

---------13:28----------
well this is quite the troll trace from

---------13:32----------
our 71 86 to the is I'll maybe corroded

---------13:34----------
you know that's actually a good idea

---------13:37----------
let's check for that so from here to

---------13:39----------
here right yeah okay it's not that it's

---------13:51----------
the trait it's between the resistor and

---------13:54----------
the [ __ ] probe point look at that son

---------13:58----------
of a I didn't see that okay this is let

---------14:01----------
me I gotta raise the light or something

---------14:04----------
okay let's raise the exposure all the

---------14:06----------
way yo youtube comment [ __ ] fix the

---------14:09----------
board why doesn't this happen more often

---------14:10----------
okay this is max exposure right here and

---------14:13----------
even at max exposure I can't see it whoa

---------14:15----------
check this out

---------14:16----------
so this resistor over here our 71 86

---------14:21----------
that's going to be the path between the

---------14:24----------
gate and the is l6 two five nine which

---------14:27----------
is going to bring it to ground so for

---------14:29----------
this to work as a voltage divider for

---------14:30----------
the voltage and the gate to be lower

---------14:31----------
than the voltage on the source our 71

---------14:34----------
eighty six has to go between the gate in

---------14:36----------
ground or elles our 7185 which is gonna

---------14:39----------
take the 16 volts from your charger and

---------14:41----------
send it straight to the gate our 71 86

---------14:43----------
is what's gonna take that whole two from

---------14:45----------
the gate send some of it to ground so

---------14:46----------
that you get down to that on nine volts

---------14:47----------
or so and the connection between the

---------14:50----------
probe point going to our 71 86 in the is

---------14:53----------
Ellis crew is good but the probe points

---------14:55----------
at our 71 86 was blown Wow look at this

---------14:59----------
so see this is the probe point let's see

---------15:02----------
if I can get a better image there for

---------15:03----------
you folks look at this that's good

---------15:09----------
zero ohms but the probe points of the

---------15:12----------
resistor it's gone

---------15:14----------
damn no really that's that's damn near

---------15:18----------
invisible like how the combo

---------15:26----------
yeah but look when you scrape away you

---------15:29----------
can see that there's no copper between

---------15:31----------
the probe points in there see it's God

---------15:34----------
let's see maybe if I scrape a little

---------15:36----------
more wow this has never happened before

---------15:40----------
this is no look the copper is there oh

---------15:45----------
wait no take it back there is copper

---------15:48----------
here what is it like intermittently its

---------15:52----------
remit Aneke inducting copper I mean what

---------15:54----------
the hell is this what are we talking

---------15:55----------
about here I don't think this microscope

---------16:03----------
light actually emits enough light for me

---------16:04----------
to give you zoom at this angle I think I

---------16:07----------
have to get a more powerful microscope

---------16:09----------
light this way I had to replace mine

---------16:10----------
recently because it died and this

---------16:12----------
microscope lights really not doing it

---------16:13----------
justice you can't see well when it's all

---------16:15----------
the way zoomed in like this I gotta get

---------16:16----------
myself a better microscope light I'm

---------16:18----------
sorry folks

---------16:19----------
for the people watching this is I think

---------16:20----------
like the $30 30 or $40 em scope light

---------16:23----------
but they make some $200 microscope like

---------16:25----------
that's way nicer I was being a

---------16:28----------
cheapskate so my apologies folks because

---------16:30----------
you can't really get a good you can't

---------16:31----------
really see what I'm seeing in zoomed in

---------16:33----------
y'all zoom out a little bit for you this

---------16:35----------
is good enough provide me to get myself

---------16:38----------
a better light cuz this thing is not

---------16:40----------
doing it justice but yeah look that

---------16:42----------
trace is barely broken look at that

---------16:44----------
you have to scrape the thing is it looks

---------16:46----------
like it's intact but it's not

---------16:48----------
it looks like it's intact it's quite

---------16:50----------
tricky

---------17:16----------
yeah I need way more light it's enough

---------17:18----------
for me but it's not enough for the

---------17:19----------
camera even at max exposure I'm gonna

---------17:23----------
get a stronger light for this the SIBO

---------17:28----------
effect Bob indle Baba Delaware

---------17:36----------
alright so I'm gonna have this wire

---------17:38----------
going straight to the chip to the chip

---------17:41----------
to the pro point and then from the pro

---------17:43----------
point to the resistor

---------17:56----------
let's secure it towards a new light

---------17:59----------
Thank You ed and I haven't seen you in a

---------18:02----------
while I hope you're doing well sorry at

---------18:05----------
all from cheeping out on the light here

---------18:07----------
I wonder if we get to send more voltage

---------18:09----------
to this light go into how long it'll

---------18:11----------
last before the diodes die that would

---------18:15----------
make a fun experiment because I have

---------18:16----------
another power supply here I have a spare

---------18:18----------
power supply here will be kind of fun

---------18:22----------
send 30 volts the Lewises microscope

---------18:28----------
let's make a fun video

---------18:32----------
okay

---------18:35----------
while there's still some flux there we

---------18:36----------
just do that

---------18:46----------
there we go

---------18:54----------
that was off my game eventually would

---------18:57----------
have what I would have done is I would

---------18:58----------
have wiped the entire I just would a

---------18:59----------
windshield wipe the whole area and

---------19:01----------
scraped it but that would have been very

---------19:02----------
inefficient so I would have most likely

---------19:04----------
replaced that transistor nothing would

---------19:06----------
have changed at that point I would have

---------19:08----------
just windshield wiped all of this which

---------19:11----------
would have got me my my solution but it

---------19:14----------
would have been way down the line but

---------19:15----------
this makes a lot more sense okay so it

---------19:18----------
looks like we're taking 60 ml amps now

---------19:19----------
which is an improvement but that's still

---------19:21----------
not turning on

---------20:21----------
now this is just being a troll

---------20:28----------
whoa okay my status had a loose

---------20:30----------
connection there we go

---------20:32----------
590 MLMs where's your PP bus at

---------20:46----------
twelve point six baby twelve point six

---------20:50----------
volts

---------20:54----------
twelve point six volts

---------21:16----------
so the charger is going to go through

---------21:18----------
this transistor however it can only go

---------21:21----------
to this transistor at the voltage on the

---------21:22----------
gate is lower than the source so you

---------21:24----------
have this setup here that allows the is

---------21:26----------
l6 to 5/9 chip over here to control

---------21:28----------
whether this opens the voltage and the

---------21:30----------
gate is to be lower than the source you

---------21:31----------
have a resistor that takes the voltage

---------21:33----------
from the source the 18 volts and puts it

---------21:35----------
straight on the gate then you have

---------21:36----------
another resistor that goes between the

---------21:38----------
gate and the ISL six two five nine so if

---------21:40----------
the ISL six two five nine doesn't do

---------21:42----------
anything then nothing will happen but if

---------21:44----------
the ISL six two five nine shorts pin two

---------21:46----------
of our seven one eight six through two

---------21:48----------
grounds then this will work as a voltage

---------21:50----------
divider it's very similar to the

---------21:51----------
backlight circuit I went over in a

---------21:52----------
recent video and this will open in the

---------21:54----------
connection between pen to and the U 7100

---------21:57----------
was bad and I couldn't notice it see one

---------21:59----------
of the things I was talking about here

---------22:00----------
was like when you get the cheap [ __ ]

---------22:02----------
what happens this is the cheap ass like

---------22:04----------
shitty twenty dollar on Amazon

---------22:06----------
microscope LED ring light you notice

---------22:08----------
when I zoomed in I couldn't really see

---------22:10----------
very well whereas my old microscope

---------22:12----------
light I could really turn it up and dial

---------22:13----------
in the detail because the more that you

---------22:15----------
zoom in the less light goes through and

---------22:17----------
I need it to be able to zoom in to see

---------22:19----------
this so I what didn't think to check

---------22:22----------
that trace because visually it looked

---------22:24----------
totally fine even at 20x it looked

---------22:26----------
totally fine I missed it so I'm gonna

---------22:28----------
get myself a better microscope bring

---------22:30----------
light so that this doesn't happen again

---------22:32----------
I learned my lesson or I may just try

---------22:34----------
sending more voltage through this one

---------22:35----------
just for fun I kind of wonder what

---------22:37----------
happens when I said thirty or forty year

---------22:38----------
well I got my bike charger over there

---------22:40----------
let's send fifty eight point eight volts

---------22:41----------
to my my ring light and see what happens

---------22:43----------
so that's it for today I hope you

---------22:44----------
learned something and I'll see you all

---------22:46----------
in the next video
