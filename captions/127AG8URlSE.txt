---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going today we're

---------00:01----------
gonna get started fixing a MacBook here

---------00:03----------
we have an a 1466 that's not powering

---------00:05----------
and not charging let's open this thing

---------00:07----------
up and see what's wrong with it

---------00:08----------
but first before we get to that first

---------00:10----------
thing we have to do on this MacBook same

---------00:11----------
thing that we do on every other MacBook

---------00:13----------
that we get here is kill its coronavirus

---------00:15----------
die corona dai Dai hai hai Dai Dai hai

---------00:19----------
hai Freudian slip you seen crept fallen

---------00:24----------
at the end of the pine stream yesterday

---------00:25----------
look at you using obscure words that

---------00:28----------
probably are not necessary to describe

---------00:31----------
the situation look at you using obscure

---------00:34----------
words well I make it simple when you can

---------00:38----------
worry use words like cret fallen okay so

---------00:42----------
this MacBooks not turning on and oh my

---------00:45----------
god why you [ __ ] fool

---------00:52----------
as always with the [ __ ] that gets sent

---------00:54----------
in by other stores doesn't you tell me

---------01:00----------
why this isn't turning on ladies and

---------01:02----------
gentlemen you tell me this is so [ __ ]

---------01:11----------
stupid

---------01:12----------
why are you gonna route the wire over

---------01:14----------
the fan like this this is so [ __ ]

---------01:19----------
dumb this is adhesive over here so you

---------01:21----------
literally you routed this wire so that

---------01:24----------
the part that's glued see that glue is

---------01:28----------
over the fence on top of the middle

---------01:30----------
section of the fan on the part that

---------01:32----------
spins around and goes spinning spinning

---------01:34----------
spinning spinning and then you plug it

---------01:36----------
in to hold it there so that it can't

---------01:38----------
spend holy [ __ ] oh my god it's just

---------01:43----------
let's see if this turns on

---------01:50----------
I'm [ __ ] magic ladies and gentlemen

---------01:53----------
magic I'm here all day I should I should

---------02:02----------
have that letter on here you deserve to

---------02:04----------
get Doc's do you freaking oh my god this

---------02:13----------
is [ __ ] stupid so

---------02:23----------
all right so we got to get a picture on

---------02:24----------
the screen next up we got to get is a

---------02:26----------
picture on the screen I was hoping to

---------02:35----------
have a good good problem to solve here

---------02:46----------
alright it looks like we're not getting

---------02:48----------
anything on the screen now and do we

---------02:50----------
have a backlight do we have an image do

---------02:54----------
we have any of that stuff one way to

---------02:56----------
find out ladies and gentlemen

---------02:58----------
just open up Paul Daniels is amazing

---------03:01----------
multimeter software and see what it

---------03:04----------
shows us so on the topic of whether or

---------03:07----------
not we have oh my god what did you do

---------03:10----------
you [ __ ] okay there's more

---------03:13----------
there's more oh alright so I was gonna

---------03:18----------
see if there's an image on the screen by

---------03:20----------
measuring the three volts going to the

---------03:22----------
screen and you know something tells me

---------03:26----------
that three volts is not going to the

---------03:27----------
screen hmm the buttons on my camera are

---------03:30----------
finally dead I can't adjust the image

---------03:31----------
anymore so why was I looking for that

---------03:33----------
well the machine was turning on right we

---------03:35----------
got the fan spinning but I wasn't

---------03:36----------
getting with anything on the screen open

---------03:39----------
up the Paul Daniel software I have to

---------03:40----------
Paul Daniel software open in the wrong

---------03:42----------
orientation and go up you over here now

---------03:46----------
this is going to be the screen connector

---------03:49----------
so there's two pieces of power I'm

---------03:51----------
interested in the first is do we have

---------03:54----------
three volts going to pins 18 and 19

---------03:58----------
hello XP why are how are you doing today

---------04:01----------
that's pp 3 v3 3.3 volts s Oh meaning

---------04:07----------
that's gonna be on when the machine is

---------04:08----------
in an Esso state which is on LCD because

---------04:14----------
it's for the LCD screen Ultra [ __ ]

---------04:18----------
because someone destroyed it that's what

---------04:20----------
this stands for next up you're going to

---------04:22----------
have the backlight over here pins 3 & 4

---------04:26----------
PP HV because this machine has PP H V s

---------04:30----------
oh because it's evaporites gonna be on

---------04:33----------
the systems in an Esso state LCD big lit

---------04:36----------
because I don't know it's from from the

---------04:40----------
south and it pronounces stuff like that

---------04:42----------
whoever made this schematic took out the

---------04:43----------
backlight it's big lit respect so that

---------04:48----------
is how this is done now I'm not getting

---------04:53----------
this because this here is exploded so

---------04:56----------
what this means is that most likely

---------04:58----------
there's a short to ground on this side

---------04:59----------
so the 3.3 volts that's supposed to be

---------05:02----------
coming out of you 8300 got poofed

---------05:06----------
because it was a short so I'm gonna

---------05:07----------
measure and see if there's still a

---------05:08----------
short-circuit right now before I do

---------05:10----------
anything else

---------05:11----------
oh the cable is gonna be absolutely fine

---------05:12----------
crystalling you'll see the cable is

---------05:14----------
beautiful see cables always fine when

---------05:17----------
this happens it's it's backlight that

---------05:20----------
destroys it it's not this because you

---------05:22----------
remember remember we're working at 3

---------05:24----------
volts not 20 or 30 and there's also no

---------05:26----------
liquid damaged over here no short to

---------05:31----------
ground no short to ground no short to

---------05:39----------
ground so we got to get that thing off

---------05:41----------
of the board is it gonna be a tough one

---------05:53----------
damn this is mean

---------06:04----------
oh they ran a train on this MacBook

---------06:14----------
oh damn the whole trace is well they all

---------06:17----------
know

---------06:37----------
all right I managed to do a little bit

---------06:39----------
of prying there yeah I think I could fit

---------06:44----------
another inductor on here 10 the pads

---------06:50----------
clean it up a little bit

---------06:55----------
geez okay do this this this

---------07:15----------
all right that's pretty clean you know

---------07:17----------
it's not perfect it's another it's not

---------07:19----------
like good as new but it's better than

---------07:22----------
new it's rossman new all right

---------07:27----------
las been fixed baby let's get that

---------07:31----------
screen of work and take

---------08:46----------
okay so you need a you need a screen -

---------08:49----------
all right well so that's about it for

---------08:53----------
that that is this does this to be clear

---------08:56----------
this does not go on like this like okay

---------08:58----------
you got to know that this is a fan right

---------09:00----------
the center part of a fan see this this

---------09:02----------
is the center part of the fan and the

---------09:04----------
center part of the fan it spins like

---------09:06----------
this see spinning you don't want to put

---------09:09----------
this sticky cable on top of this part of

---------09:11----------
the fan so that when you plug it in it

---------09:14----------
keeps the fan from spinning that's not

---------09:16----------
the way this works you put this cable

---------09:17----------
like this and yeah that's about that and

---------09:24----------
as always I hope you learned something

---------09:26----------
I'll see you all in the next video bye

---------09:28----------
now
