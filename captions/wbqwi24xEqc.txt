---------00:00----------
hi welcome today's stream where I'm

---------00:01----------
gonna be going over what I believe to be

---------00:03----------
apples next recall this is going to be

---------00:06----------
of the 12 inch a 15 34 2015 model

---------00:09----------
MacBook it's because a specific failure

---------00:11----------
continues to occur on these machines

---------00:13----------
even when there is no evidence of liquid

---------00:15----------
damage no evidence of physical damage

---------00:17----------
and no evidence of use of a knockoff

---------00:19----------
charger this is consistent and has been

---------00:21----------
coming into our store on a regular basis

---------00:23----------
and it's been happening enough within a

---------00:26----------
short enough time period that I believe

---------00:28----------
that they're eventually going to get

---------00:30----------
pushed into put doing an extended

---------00:31----------
warranty recall assuming that the people

---------00:33----------
that buy these products actually hold

---------00:35----------
them accountable so I'm gonna show you

---------00:36----------
what the issue is how we diagnose it how

---------00:39----------
we repair it and with any luck hopefully

---------00:42----------
Apple will start covering these so that

---------00:43----------
we we don't have to so let's get into it

---------00:47----------
so the issue manifests itself like this

---------00:49----------
we're going to plug the charger in and

---------00:52----------
I'm gonna show you what we get on the

---------00:55----------
DCN so let's plug in the charger let's

---------00:58----------
get the multimeter going so you could

---------01:00----------
see it on the screen here all right get

---------01:04----------
the serial mode on by the way it's weird

---------01:08----------
I didn't receive notification that would

---------01:10----------
explain why there's only 232 viewers

---------01:12----------
thank you yeah

---------01:14----------
YouTube does that to certain channels

---------01:16----------
where they stop sending out their

---------01:17----------
notifications I guess I'm on the list or

---------01:20----------
something yeah I wonder how that

---------01:22----------
happened anyway

---------01:24----------
so let's check this out so this over

---------01:27----------
here is the board view and this is the

---------01:30----------
charging port over here this is where

---------01:31----------
the voltage is going to come in from the

---------01:33----------
charger and you have F 4700 which is a

---------01:36----------
fuse which is going to be taking the

---------01:38----------
voltage from the charger so we're going

---------01:40----------
to find F 4700 right here

---------01:46----------
so this is the fuse sitting between the

---------01:49----------
charger and the machine and typically

---------01:51----------
this is going to be 20 volts coming from

---------01:53----------
the charger but if you check what we get

---------01:56----------
on this device when I measure we're

---------02:04----------
going to get less

---------02:09----------
hmm ahem we're getting zero volts I

---------02:15----------
don't see if that's all plugged in

---------02:17----------
properly

---------02:33----------
here we go this how to change how it was

---------02:36----------
plugged in so we're getting five point

---------02:38----------
two volts but five point two volts is

---------02:40----------
wrong this is USB see this USB C charger

---------02:43----------
is something that supposed to be working

---------02:45----------
at 20 volts why is it only working at

---------02:47----------
five instead of twenty why isn't the

---------02:49----------
charger putting out the twenty it's

---------02:51----------
supposed to why isn't the computer

---------02:52----------
telling the charger to put out the

---------02:54----------
twenty volts that it's supposed to well

---------02:55----------
let's dive it and find out so if we look

---------02:57----------
over the schematic here you'll see there

---------02:59----------
is communication that occurs between the

---------03:01----------
charger and the computer so if we were

---------03:06----------
to just put the schematic fullscreen for

---------03:08----------
a moment let that take center stage

---------03:11----------
you'll see we have a bunch of

---------03:13----------
bi-directional data lines some of these

---------03:15----------
bi-directional data lines are for things

---------03:17----------
like over here you have for display port

---------03:20----------
for USB for more DisplayPort but I'm not

---------03:23----------
really interested in that so much as I

---------03:25----------
am interested in actual power going back

---------03:28----------
and forth between the two so I want to

---------03:30----------
try to figure out how this machine

---------03:32----------
negotiates the how this machine

---------03:35----------
negotiates for the Chargers what

---------03:36----------
bi-directional data lines responsible

---------03:38----------
for talking to it and telling it give me

---------03:40----------
20 volts not of this none of this

---------03:43----------
low-voltage 5 volt BS so let's just take

---------03:46----------
a look at some of this so LS I'm gonna

---------03:49----------
take a guess that that's low speed USB

---------03:50----------
USB 3 that's gonna be high speed USB

---------03:53----------
this is gonna be the other sort of low

---------03:55----------
speed USB so we have to find where what

---------03:58----------
else could be here so over here we have

---------04:00----------
a chip that says charger detection and

---------04:03----------
it has a bi-directional data line over

---------04:05----------
here that's gonna go to all of this

---------04:11----------
stuff that's so that talk so let's just

---------04:16----------
try it fun to do some pattern

---------04:17----------
recognition here what are the all these

---------04:18----------
things have in common so we have this IC

---------04:21----------
for charge of detection and it's powered

---------04:24----------
off of PP 3 V 3 R 3 V 0 underscore Aon

---------04:27----------
we have this one over here this also

---------04:31----------
does some communication 85 CC one this

---------04:33----------
is a bi-directional data line this

---------04:37----------
bi-directional data line goes to this

---------04:43----------
where H goes to the charger this is also

---------04:47----------
powered by pp 3 V 3 R 3 V 0

---------04:50----------
Aon and if we check out these

---------04:52----------
bi-directional data lines bi-directional

---------04:55----------
I mean they talk to each other these

---------04:57----------
chips are also powered by pp 3 V 3 R 3 V

---------05:00----------
0 Aon so while on the older MacBook Pros

---------05:04----------
in the older MacBook Air is the first

---------05:06----------
power rail that was most important to

---------05:07----------
get the charger turning on was pp 3 V 4

---------05:10----------
to underscore g3 huh it seems like on

---------05:12----------
these machines one of the power rails

---------05:13----------
I'm most interested in is pp 3 V 3 R 3 V

---------05:17----------
0 so let's see if that's present over

---------05:19----------
here and let's see what we get so while

---------05:21----------
it's still plugged in we're going to

---------05:23----------
check out pp 3 v 3 R 3 V 0 so first

---------05:28----------
thing I've got to do is find out where I

---------05:31----------
can find that on the board so let's see

---------05:36----------
Pepe 3 V 3 R 3 V 0 a

---------05:40----------
o n where do we find you okay so I can

---------05:52----------
find you right over here so we're gonna

---------05:54----------
take a look there and see what we get so

---------05:57----------
I got the multimeter set to voltage

---------06:00----------
measurements and

---------06:15----------
looks like we're getting point 5 volts

---------06:24----------
0.5 volts is a far cry from the 3.3

---------06:27----------
volts I would expect to get at PP 3 v 3

---------06:30----------
so first thing I want to do let's see if

---------06:32----------
there's a short circuit to ground maybe

---------06:34----------
we got a short circuit to ground maybe

---------06:35----------
that's a problem so but the multimeter

---------06:38----------
into voltage mode I mean into resistance

---------06:42----------
mode and let's see if there's a short

---------06:44----------
circuit

---------06:45----------
so remember PP 3 V 3 R 3 V 0 it's going

---------06:49----------
to be right over here and that is over

---------06:52----------
here so we're gonna measure and see what

---------06:56----------
our resistance to ground is and our

---------06:58----------
resistance to ground is six point seven

---------07:00----------
ohms six point seven ohms is way too low

---------07:04----------
on a working board that's gonna be much

---------07:05----------
higher than that which means that we

---------07:06----------
have a short circuit on that line so now

---------07:08----------
we have to do is figure out where that

---------07:10----------
short circuit is and we're going to do

---------07:12----------
that by injecting voltage into the line

---------07:13----------
so I am going to get a set of banana

---------07:17----------
plugs and solder a wire to that section

---------07:22----------
of the board and then we're going to

---------07:25----------
inject 3.42 volts into the board so I'm

---------07:28----------
gonna turn on this little power supply I

---------07:30----------
got a link to it in the description

---------07:31----------
below if you want to know where to find

---------07:32----------
something like this variable output

---------07:34----------
power supply we're gonna set this down

---------07:36----------
to one volt to be really conservative

---------07:39----------
let's just 1.5 volts right now that's it

---------07:43----------
and plug this in so I'm gonna have one

---------07:46----------
wire that's going to be going to ground

---------07:49----------
just gonna chop this up a little bit and

---------07:52----------
we're gonna try to find our

---------07:53----------
short-circuit

---------08:03----------
now we're just gonna find a finer ground

---------08:07----------
here that I don't mind soldering to

---------08:10----------
[Music]

---------08:15----------
perhaps a screw hole joke Rogen on

---------08:19----------
twitch this stream borked his twitch not

---------08:22----------
working yet again I what a website now

---------08:27----------
that the trade stream seems to be

---------08:28----------
working on twitch I can't sorry for

---------08:30----------
blaming twitch seems like twitch is

---------08:32----------
doing just fine his stream lab working

---------08:40----------
that's a good question I'll do I

---------08:48----------
too late to check now into soldering so

---------08:51----------
we're going to turn the iron on

---------08:56----------
[Music]

---------09:03----------
come on there we go iron will it beeped

---------09:07----------
see how much faster that works when you

---------09:09----------
actually turn it on I'm just gonna this

---------09:13----------
is just some quick and dirty soldering

---------09:15----------
job there nothing too crazy okay now we

---------09:19----------
got to find a place on the board that we

---------09:21----------
can solder to PP 3 V 3 R 3 V 0

---------09:34----------
so let's find that now

---------09:42----------
all right anything on this other side

---------09:43----------
that's so I can put it let's say right

---------09:46----------
over here

---------09:49----------
this stuff is all pretty small so I

---------09:55----------
might have to solder a wire to a wire or

---------10:02----------
just cheat and use jason's

---------10:22----------
okay so I'm gonna tin this section so

---------10:29----------
this over here represents pp 3 B 3 R 3 V

---------10:31----------
0 I'm just gonna tin that little

---------10:33----------
capacitor and then I'm gonna solder a

---------10:38----------
teeny tiny jumper wire to it

---------11:08----------
time to find a teeny-tiny jumper wire

---------11:27----------
yeah use some of that alright beautiful

---------11:36----------
okay

---------11:47----------
okay that's good and now attach that to

---------11:54----------
this and we'll be set

---------12:21----------
scrape away some of the enamel and the

---------12:23----------
jumper wire the enamel wire

---------12:36----------
and this wire is going to the positive

---------12:38----------
of the power splice the whole idea here

---------12:40----------
is we're going to inject some voltage

---------12:42----------
directly into that 3.3 volt line and

---------12:46----------
we're gonna see what gets hot on that

---------12:49----------
rail and I'm going to do something today

---------12:58----------
that I don't usually do and I'm actually

---------13:01----------
gonna use this Union or pair thermal

---------13:03----------
imaging thing for this once I find out

---------13:07----------
where the plug is go so you'll be able

---------13:15----------
to see what it is that a short-circuited

---------13:20----------
this thing isn't all terrible when you

---------13:23----------
actually know to hit that Chinese button

---------13:30----------
so let's let's get this thing brought up

---------13:32----------
on the desk so now that we've got that

---------13:34----------
soldered on we're going to inject some

---------13:37----------
power in let's get the thermal cam up

---------13:40----------
here thermal camera BAM and we're hey

---------13:49----------
where'd I go I want to see me here we go

---------14:01----------
okay so this is our board okay I'm gonna

---------14:25----------
turn this on and at 1.5 volts as you

---------14:34----------
can't see because they have the refresh

---------14:37----------
rate it looks like we're at 1.5 volts we

---------14:39----------
are using point two amps so let's go

---------14:48----------
back to the thermal imager now the thing

---------14:50----------
I didn't like about this thermal imaging

---------14:52----------
software is that even when you select

---------14:54----------
English and even though this thing costs

---------14:56----------
nine hundred US dollars that's right

---------14:59----------
nine hundred dollars the button that

---------15:01----------
actually does most of the work is in

---------15:03----------
Chinese so once you figure that out you

---------15:07----------
hit the button and this $900 thermal

---------15:10----------
imager which you can get from union

---------15:11----------
repair will tell you what the hottest

---------15:14----------
thing on the board is so over here most

---------15:18----------
of the board is 26 Celsius as you can

---------15:19----------
see but if you click over here right

---------15:23----------
where it lights up that chip is 44

---------15:25----------
Celsius and if I were to up the voltage

---------15:30----------
on this a little bit like to let's say

---------15:33----------
1.8 or 2 volts it would become even more

---------15:35----------
obvious and just start glowing yeah so

---------15:38----------
at 2 volts that's at 52 Celsius at 2.4

---------15:48----------
volts that chip is at 60 Celsius so

---------15:51----------
let's see what that chip is and what it

---------15:52----------
does didn't you say in a previous video

---------15:56----------
that you wouldn't use thermal imaging

---------15:58----------
because it's mostly useless yes so let

---------16:01----------
me this is just so that I could show you

---------16:02----------
visually now this thing is $900 so let

---------16:05----------
me just show you how it is I would find

---------16:07----------
that short-circuit if I did not want to

---------16:09----------
spend $900 on a thermal imager but

---------16:11----------
rather was limited to spending a dollar

---------16:13----------
at the

---------16:14----------
corner store on let's say alcohol so

---------16:17----------
this here is the area and I would take

---------16:21----------
something like I would turn off the

---------16:23----------
power supply like so and I would pour

---------16:26----------
alcohol on the board like so and then

---------16:30----------
when you turn on the power supply see

---------16:32----------
how that would just happen as soon as I

---------16:33----------
turned on the power supply that it got

---------16:35----------
hot and the alcohol went away so that's

---------16:37----------
the reason that I don't spend the money

---------16:39----------
on the thermal imager

---------16:40----------
because whatever a thermal imager can do

---------16:43----------
it with today's technology you can do as

---------16:45----------
well if not better with canned air

---------16:49----------
turned upside down so that it shoots out

---------16:51----------
freeze spray actual freeze spray or

---------16:53----------
alcohol so watch it's off on and it

---------16:56----------
instantly evaporates so the issue that

---------16:58----------
we have here is this chip just to be

---------17:02----------
clear there's no way in hell that I'm

---------17:04----------
endorsing that somebody spend $900 in

---------17:06----------
this thermal imager it was just using it

---------17:07----------
to show you what it looks like just so

---------17:09----------
that were all 110 percent clear on that

---------17:11----------
I am solely using that because it was

---------17:13----------
sent to me as a review unit for free but

---------17:17----------
to continue let's look at the schematic

---------17:19----------
and board view and see what it is we

---------17:22----------
find there so this chip this is the one

---------17:25----------
that's getting hot is you 4700 so let's

---------17:28----------
look that up on the schematic and see

---------17:30----------
what that's for you 4700 is responsible

---------17:33----------
for shorting PP 3 v 3 R 3 v 0 Aon to

---------17:37----------
ground so this chip let's see let's just

---------17:41----------
see you get an idea of what it talks to

---------17:43----------
I'm gonna get the schematic solely on

---------17:44----------
the screen so that you can see this and

---------17:47----------
all of its glory nice and zoomed in psi

---------17:55----------
Q says but now you have the show error

---------17:56----------
button in Chinese I gotta say the one

---------17:58----------
thing that Union repair managed to do

---------18:00----------
that Paul Daniels never could was create

---------18:02----------
a fine default button I've been asking

---------18:05----------
Paul Daniels to create a fine fault

---------18:07----------
button for like four years now you're

---------18:09----------
the Bob Ross up top repair thank you

---------18:17----------
so let's just go take a look at what

---------18:21----------
this talks to so the connection enable

---------18:25----------
what's that do it looks like that talks

---------18:29----------
to a chip that deals with

---------18:31----------
current-limiting that sends five volts

---------18:35----------
to deals with five volts of the charger

---------18:39----------
okay it does that it has a

---------18:41----------
bi-directional data line called BP PD

---------18:43----------
connection detect so it deals with the

---------18:46----------
host port host port micro interface it's

---------18:50----------
responsible for quite a few different

---------18:51----------
things but what's important to us is

---------18:54----------
that it's shorting PP 3 V 3 R 3 V 0 to

---------18:56----------
ground and that will not do which means

---------18:59----------
that it has got to go and if it's going

---------19:01----------
to go then that means we need to replace

---------19:02----------
it with something else so what are we

---------19:04----------
going to replace it with and how are we

---------19:06----------
going to find a replacement chip said

---------19:10----------
how would you find a replacement chip I

---------19:13----------
wonder where you'd go check out store

---------19:19----------
dot Rossmann group comm today where you

---------19:20----------
can buy all sorts of chipsets voltage

---------19:23----------
controllers fuses filters soldering

---------19:25----------
equipment ultrasonics flux and even

---------19:27----------
solder paste search for the chip based

---------19:29----------
on the number in the schematic and have

---------19:31----------
a list bro be brought up immediately

---------19:33----------
watch as it tells you exactly which

---------19:35----------
boards it's compatible with also exactly

---------19:38----------
what the issues typically are with that

---------19:41----------
chip not only does it tell you exactly

---------19:42----------
which chip to buy for your machine

---------19:44----------
it also tells you what the common fixes

---------19:46----------
are that that's what the common faults

---------19:49----------
are that that chip causes not sure which

---------19:51----------
chips to buy just search by your model

---------19:53----------
motherboard and it'll bring up

---------19:54----------
everything compatible with your board

---------19:56----------
Ross and repair group your supply store

---------19:59----------
your know what was it they said with

---------20:01----------
Modell sporting goods you how to answer

---------20:02----------
the phone your hometown sporting goods

---------20:04----------
store Ross from the repair group your

---------20:06----------
hometown MacBook chip store anyway so I

---------20:10----------
got to keep that up so that I can

---------20:11----------
actually find out which bin it's in so I

---------20:15----------
can find this chip in e6 so I'm gonna

---------20:20----------
get myself a new chip we're gonna repeal

---------20:22----------
and replace this one and hopefully have

---------20:24----------
a board that will turn on the charger so

---------20:26----------
I'm gonna get you get a replacement one

---------20:28----------
and I will be right back

---------21:00----------
one thing I really want to drive home

---------21:02----------
while you're looking at this board

---------21:04----------
do you see liquid damage do you see

---------21:06----------
physical damage do you see anything by

---------21:08----------
that any corrosion anything at all that

---------21:10----------
would indicate that the user mistreated

---------21:12----------
the machine there's no proof there's

---------21:14----------
nothing and I would say that is we've

---------21:17----------
literally gotten one machine ever that

---------21:20----------
had this issue where there was any sign

---------21:22----------
that the user treated it poorly good

---------21:24----------
night

---------21:24----------
but everything else every single time

---------21:29----------
this has gone bad it was just out of

---------21:32----------
nowhere just listen

---------21:34----------
they bring a mint-condition machine and

---------21:37----------
it's just dead how much money does this

---------21:42----------
cost if you look it up Paul let's see

---------21:44----------
what does this computer actually cost

---------21:46----------
new I'm curious so we're gonna do here

---------21:50----------
is I'm gonna cover the surrounding area

---------21:52----------
with a metal shield thank you to Kareem

---------21:56----------
Holley I appreciate that so we're gonna

---------21:59----------
cover the surrounding stuff with this

---------22:01----------
little iPhone shield so we don't heat it

---------22:03----------
up too much and we're gonna get a

---------22:05----------
replacement chip going on there stop

---------22:12----------
saying repeal and replace I have a new

---------22:14----------
reason to say it more regularly now okay

---------22:23----------
13 is $1600 for this machine and how

---------22:27----------
many USB ports does it have one port

---------22:33----------
yeah this thing starts at $1,300 $1,300

---------22:44----------
I'm sure there's gonna be more people on

---------22:46----------
that forum that I was linking to in the

---------22:48----------
keyboard thread saying sir MacRumors is

---------23:00----------
such a cesspool sometimes seriously

---------23:03----------
these I mean the though I can't I just

---------23:08----------
can't identify with the degree to which

---------23:10----------
people who share interests who share

---------23:12----------
concerns bash and crap on each other

---------23:16----------
just so that their corporate overlords

---------23:19----------
is not either that they don't get angry

---------23:22----------
at their corporate overlords it's just

---------23:24----------
it's it's hilarious

---------23:25----------
it said at the same time but if you read

---------23:28----------
that forum it's like oh you can't expect

---------23:30----------
stuff to wet what worked forever I

---------23:32----------
should have bought Apple Care hey you

---------23:34----------
can't expect stuff to work longer than

---------23:36----------
14 months what are you crazy

---------23:39----------
really really

---------23:47----------
all right so we're gonna that's zoom in

---------23:53----------
on this for you should go to epic here

---------23:57----------
you know what you should have bought you

---------23:59----------
should have bought a $600 computer

---------24:01----------
because not only would this not happen

---------24:04----------
but you could buy tooth it's genuinely

---------24:08----------
sad because there are so many things

---------24:09----------
that Apple does to for people better

---------24:12----------
than what Windows or PC based machines

---------24:16----------
will do for people or like traditional

---------24:17----------
PCs will do for people or $99 like your

---------24:22----------
Lenovo Paul there are a lot of things

---------24:25----------
that they do better and they they they

---------24:26----------
have a market of people that will just

---------24:28----------
buy their stuff under a virtue that like

---------24:32----------
where it's just it's just their default

---------24:34----------
is just I'm gonna buy this I'm not even

---------24:35----------
gonna research how do you screw that up

---------24:38----------
but it it's like they're trying to screw

---------24:41----------
it up I don't get it I don't get it you

---------24:44----------
know treat your users better don't take

---------24:49----------
for granted the fact that you have

---------24:50----------
customers there's any lesson I've ever

---------24:51----------
learned I don't take for granted the

---------24:53----------
fact that people want to give you money

---------25:03----------
I Petri hipsters drive savers video is a

---------25:07----------
cesspool a bunch of we trust drive

---------25:09----------
savers who the hell are you STFU drive

---------25:11----------
savers is great yeah except for the fact

---------25:14----------
that Jessa recovered a phone that they

---------25:16----------
didn't and she doesn't have a

---------25:19----------
two-million-dollar clean room she has a

---------25:22----------
two million dollar house but not a two

---------25:23----------
million dollar clean room there's a

---------25:26----------
difference

---------25:37----------
okay I shouldn't assume then usually I

---------25:39----------
don't zoom in much because as soon as I

---------25:41----------
push down on anything it goes out of

---------25:43----------
focus but we got the chip soldered on

---------25:45----------
there there we go beautiful beautiful

---------25:49----------
it's a little crooked but that's my

---------25:54----------
that's my signature someone says

---------25:56----------
Stockholm Syndrome

---------25:57----------
yeah you can like what a company does

---------25:59----------
for you but still you can like the

---------26:00----------
products they produce but still be angry

---------26:02----------
when they do something stupid

---------26:04----------
I love Lenovo they did super fish that

---------26:07----------
was dumb you got to call them out when

---------26:09----------
they do something dumb and you got to

---------26:11----------
call them out when they screw you over

---------26:17----------
don't let yourself get screwed okay

---------26:26----------
we're gonna give this a second to cool

---------26:28----------
off give this a moment and cool off here

---------26:36----------
just pick up that little bit bit of

---------26:38----------
solder blob over there clean that off a

---------26:41----------
little later we'll clean off that screw

---------26:43----------
hole later once we confirm that this

---------26:44----------
whole thing works beautifully all right

---------26:57----------
stop trolling Maisy she said oh my go in

---------27:00----------
a two million dollar house Maisy go to

---------27:02----------
Zillow learn ask your mom how to use

---------27:04----------
Zillow and you'll find out that your mom

---------27:06----------
is a two million dollar house

---------27:11----------
what ceiling lights do you use I use

---------27:15----------
some cheap LED t8 tubes that I got from

---------27:18----------
eBay so we're just gonna wait a second

---------27:24----------
for this to cool off I would send a

---------27:29----------
phone to Jessa before I sent it to app

---------27:31----------
to drive savers I would send a phone to

---------27:34----------
Jessa

---------27:34----------
if Jessa was two thousand dollars and

---------27:37----------
drive savers was two hundred I would

---------27:39----------
still send my phone to Jessa

---------27:40----------
that's this we have a two million dollar

---------27:48----------
clue how are you feeling today we'll see

---------27:56----------
if this works so let's plug this in

---------27:58----------
all right ready for the moment of truth

---------28:01----------
get my multimeter on-screen or they got

---------28:04----------
to get myself a smaller keyboard for

---------28:06----------
this desk I have the keyboard sitting in

---------28:10----------
between my water bottle and the thermal

---------28:14----------
camera it actually kind of makes things

---------28:18----------
fit perfectly all right so let's go back

---------28:21----------
to our DC in fuse over here this is the

---------28:24----------
DC input fuse we're gonna put the meter

---------28:26----------
in voltage mode get the range set right

---------28:29----------
plug this in and let's see if it

---------28:32----------
communicates properly with the charger

---------28:35----------
and gives me the 20 volts that I want 20

---------28:39----------
volts great job dumbass

---------28:46----------
yeah let's try that 20 volts yeah and

---------28:52----------
don't shoot your multimeter to ground

---------28:54----------
did you hear that I wonder if everybody

---------28:57----------
else heard that alright we're getting 20

---------28:59----------
volts and now just to confirm that it's

---------29:01----------
turning on because we keep in mind this

---------29:03----------
model does not have a fan I can't I

---------29:05----------
can't check fan spin

---------29:06----------
I'm gonna check CPU vcore so cpu v core

---------29:10----------
is gonna be somewhere

---------29:11----------
all the way by the CPU over here let C

---------29:15----------
be PVC CSO CPU okay we're gonna check on

---------29:29----------
some of these caps all the way down here

---------29:31----------
check that this thing is turning on

---------29:33----------
working beautiful alright this is the c

---------29:46----------
p-- 1.58 volts so we've got cpu v core

---------29:52----------
we've got the charger working and all as

---------29:55----------
well

---------29:55----------
all fixed working great so this is what

---------29:58----------
I think the next Apple recall is going

---------30:00----------
to be I think it's gonna be the 12-inch

---------30:02----------
MacBook from 2015 the a 1534 model you

---------30:06----------
can tell if you have this board inside

---------30:07----------
if it has a model number eight to zero

---------30:10----------
zero zero zero four five that's the a

---------30:13----------
1534 12-inch MacBook from 2015 you bet

---------30:17----------
that a lot of people are gonna be

---------30:18----------
reporting these as having random

---------30:20----------
failures or randomly being dead and it's

---------30:23----------
not different causes and every single

---------30:24----------
one of them 99.999% of the time that

---------30:27----------
somebody reports that this machine is

---------30:28----------
completely dead out of the blue no you

---------30:31----------
just out of nowhere it's going to be u

---------30:33----------
4700 died and shorted pp 3 V 3 R 3 V 0

---------30:38----------
to ground that is that is a serious

---------30:41----------
issue this does not require liquid it

---------30:44----------
doesn't require physical damage it

---------30:46----------
doesn't require misuse from the user it

---------30:48----------
just happens

---------30:50----------
it goes poof and that's that so if you

---------30:53----------
are getting these machines in your shop

---------30:55----------
check this out this is gonna be a very

---------30:56----------
common issue that you're gonna need to

---------30:58----------
be aware of it so that you can offer

---------31:00----------
this service to your customers so that

---------31:01----------
you could fix these damaged machines and

---------31:03----------
that's it for today and as always I hope

---------31:05----------
you learned something and if you're a

---------31:07----------
customer that bought this machine from

---------31:09----------
Apple and you have this issue please by

---------31:11----------
all means shove it in their face make

---------31:14----------
sure that they know about this so that

---------31:16----------
they stop getting away with giving users

---------31:20----------
thirteen hundred to eighteen hundred

---------31:22----------
dollar products that work for a year or

---------31:23----------
two and die of

---------31:25----------
fall to their own the only reason they

---------31:26----------
get away with this stuff is because

---------31:28----------
users let them get away with it you can

---------31:30----------
enjoy their products you can appreciate

---------31:32----------
their products you can use them to be

---------31:34----------
productive that's all great stuff but

---------31:36----------
don't let them bend you over don't let

---------31:38----------
them take your money and not give you

---------31:40----------
what you pay for that's it for today
