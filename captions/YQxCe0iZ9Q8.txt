---------00:00----------
so today I'm going to be fixing in a

---------00:02----------
1181 that has no backlight one

---------00:04----------
disclaimer that I'd like to give I don't

---------00:06----------
have the nicest tripod I don't have the

---------00:08----------
nicest camera set up but I'm not a

---------00:09----------
camera man so I don't have a camera that

---------00:12----------
I can just you know mouth on the ceiling

---------00:14----------
and do 30x zoom to get it down to so you

---------00:17----------
can see exactly what I'm doing

---------00:19----------
so when I'm doing this work instead of

---------00:21----------
soldering like I'm used to I have to do

---------00:23----------
something like this and kind of like try

---------00:24----------
to guess where the I am with my

---------00:27----------
head this far away so if you're inclined

---------00:29----------
to insult the amount of time it takes

---------00:31----------
for me to solder a very simple wire to a

---------00:33----------
very small resistor please do go

---------00:36----------
yourself and realize that the reason

---------00:37----------
that's taking me five to 10 minutes

---------00:39----------
instead of 10 to 30 seconds because I'm

---------00:41----------
choosing to record it so that you can

---------00:43----------
actually learn and benefit from it

---------00:45----------
so if you would like to learn watch if

---------00:48----------
you'd like to make fun of the fact that

---------00:49----------
it's going to take me about five or ten

---------00:51----------
minutes to do it should be a three

---------00:52----------
second soldering job again go

---------00:55----------
yourself

---------00:56----------
that being said let's move on to the

---------00:57----------
video alright so here we have an a 1181

---------01:00----------
MacBook with an eight to zero 2496

---------01:04----------
motherboard and it has backlight issues

---------01:06----------
so new inverter new screen new inverter

---------01:09----------
water the three pieces that typically go

---------01:12----------
bad the wire that goes between the

---------01:14----------
motherboard and the inverter the

---------01:17----------
inverter which turns the little DC

---------01:20----------
signal from the motherboard into a

---------01:21----------
larger AC voltage with the screen and

---------01:23----------
the screen with the screens back look

---------01:25----------
those are the three things that usually

---------01:27----------
go bad so we open this computer to take

---------01:30----------
a look at it and where they're supposed

---------01:31----------
to be a zero I believe I'm guessing here

---------01:35----------
is zero resistor that goes between the

---------01:36----------
five volt power supply of the board and

---------01:38----------
this first pin of the inverter cable

---------01:41----------
there is a gaping hole and there's no

---------01:45----------
trace going between here and here

---------01:46----------
anymore like I've already put a zero ohm

---------01:49----------
resistor there I I know I didn't start

---------01:52----------
the video from the beginning I actually

---------01:54----------
you had a couple of paying customers

---------01:54----------
walk in so I didn't have the time to put

---------01:56----------
up the camera but I didn't get that far

---------01:59----------
so I'm going to either it I put the

---------02:01----------
camera on again

---------02:03----------
don't complain that this video is not

---------02:05----------
complete I just don't feel like taking

---------02:07----------
that part off just to have a complete

---------02:08----------
video

---------02:18----------
zero advertising revenue that I asked

---------02:20----------
for things so there's only one ped here

---------02:24----------
and that's the more that's the pad that

---------02:27----------
goes to the pathway that goes to this

---------02:29----------
first pin so I've laid a resistor down

---------02:32----------
there now while not hitting the tripod

---------02:36----------
I'm the best I can just solder around

---------02:38----------
the tripod and a little bash and

---------02:43----------
solder on the side of that they're

---------02:45----------
resistant

---------02:50----------
he's a thinner side

---------03:04----------
it's harder to do on camera because I

---------03:06----------
can't put my head directly over it so I

---------03:09----------
can barely see what the I'm doing

---------03:14----------
I'm sure it'll turn out just fine

---------03:17----------
just by

---------03:19----------
I don't actually need to see what I'm

---------03:20----------
doing

---------03:26----------
there I almost flipped it right off the

---------03:28----------
board

---------03:29----------
okay maybe I should see what I'm doing

---------03:37----------
[Music]

---------03:43----------
[Music]

---------03:49----------
you don't get to run away a little

---------03:51----------
resistor

---------03:56----------
you're not done though I say so

---------04:04----------
[Music]

---------04:17----------
[Music]

---------04:26----------
magnetized tweezers can be the best

---------04:29----------
thing in the world or hell on earth

---------04:42----------
for me usually hell on earth

---------04:56----------
[Music]

---------05:27----------
I'll take a little wire

---------05:29----------
[Music]

---------05:45----------
today on both ends

---------06:18----------
[Music]

---------06:23----------
now this is a five volt regulator

---------06:26----------
believe

---------06:31----------
[Music]

---------06:42----------
putting in disgusting disgusting blob of

---------06:45----------
solder on there

---------06:46----------
shameful Club sorry

---------06:49----------
 shameful upside

---------07:02----------
because this still in the concept phase

---------07:07----------
when you're just trying to see if your

---------07:08----------
idea works going for the perfect solder

---------07:10----------
joint is not in the perfect everything

---------07:12----------
and the perfect looks like it's just not

---------07:15----------
that important because the time that you

---------07:17----------
waste on that is time you're going aways

---------07:20----------
from figuring out if your idea works and

---------07:22----------
you're doing this kind of stuff it's

---------07:24----------
really important to keep your patience

---------07:26----------
so if you have five ideas that you want

---------07:29----------
to try good so you got your ideas each

---------07:32----------
one try to bang them out as quickly as

---------07:33----------
possible without being distracted by

---------07:34----------
making it look perfect or having the

---------07:36----------
perfect joint or having the perfect

---------07:38----------
component value

---------07:42----------
because anything that's going to make

---------07:43----------
you think or reach for something or try

---------07:45----------
again is just going to get in the way of

---------07:48----------
your patience and your patience is

---------07:49----------
really important when you're dealing

---------07:52----------
with these types of repairs

---------07:54----------
[Music]

---------08:02----------
I'll be honest the difference between a

---------08:03----------
zero ohm resistor and a fuse to me if I

---------08:06----------
have to get up to get one when I'm still

---------08:08----------
in the testing phase I don't care don't

---------08:12----------
care

---------08:14----------
not one day

---------08:22----------
the difference between a 24-volt fusing

---------08:24----------
our 32 volt fuse all of that again for

---------08:26----------
the final finished masterpiece sure for

---------08:29----------
the phase of diagnosis and figuring out

---------08:31----------
what it is it's actually wrong rocket

---------08:34----------
bike here because if I focus on all that

---------08:38----------
I'm not going to focus on doing my job

---------08:41----------
I'm just

---------08:43----------
mine

---------08:47----------
[Music]

---------08:54----------
I don't want to lose more than I've

---------08:56----------
already lost

---------08:57----------
[Music]

---------09:17----------
so I'll ring around the tripod really

---------09:19----------
sucks balls I gotta say

---------09:22----------
I have to start over

---------09:25----------
not that it actually start over

---------09:29----------
imagine that

---------09:33----------
[Music]

---------09:41----------
[Music]

---------09:56----------
[Music]

---------09:58----------
also this would be much easier with

---------10:00----------
smaller wire I'm using the wire from the

---------10:03----------
inside of an LVDS cable because I ran

---------10:07----------
out of the super thin wire they have

---------10:09----------
this great great wire for jump ring

---------10:12----------
connections on these motherboards where

---------10:13----------
it's so light that it has no it doesn't

---------10:17----------
have any like physical resistance like

---------10:20----------
if you'd if you pull on that wire it's

---------10:23----------
not going to pull up let's see if that

---------10:25----------
wire attached to a resistor the

---------10:27----------
resistors not gonna get ripped off the

---------10:28----------
board the wire is so light that it's

---------10:30----------
just going to be ripped off of the often

---------10:33----------
be resistant

---------10:38----------
[Music]

---------10:49----------
[Music]

---------11:06----------
[Music]

---------11:24----------
[Music]

---------11:36----------
[Music]

---------12:09----------
[Music]

---------13:05----------
[Music]

---------13:16----------
[Music]

---------13:50----------
[Music]

---------14:09----------
[Music]

---------14:34----------
[Music]

---------15:02----------
[Music]

---------15:22----------
[Music]

---------15:46----------
[Music]

---------15:58----------
[Music]

---------16:08----------
[Music]

---------16:28----------
[Music]

---------16:35----------
[Music]

---------17:18----------
[Music]

---------17:26----------
cannot see another thing I'm

---------18:00----------
[Music]

---------18:30----------
don't beat the ground

---------18:42----------
the kind of way

---------18:47----------
[Music]

---------19:09----------
[Music]

---------19:16----------
[Music]

---------19:18----------
okay

---------19:22----------
and out of the 30 second job is done

---------19:25----------
after 15 minutes let's see if this

---------19:28----------
actually works

---------19:32----------
[Music]

---------19:48----------
now you want to be very careful to not

---------19:50----------
actually touch an inverter when you're

---------19:51----------
 with something like this because

---------19:54----------
you can shock yourself halfway to death

---------19:59----------
murder is a very dangerous thing could

---------20:01----------
actually touch

---------20:08----------
you can't see the camera in the screen

---------20:11----------
from this angle so we'll change it

---------20:15----------
you

---------20:26----------
victory that is the old strain that I

---------20:30----------
was testing with but it lights up so we

---------20:34----------
are good

---------20:39----------
and let's just get a little close-up of

---------20:41----------
the wind here

---------20:45----------
you

---------20:54----------
come on JVC zoom you can do better than

---------20:59----------
that I'm sure you can do better than

---------21:01----------
that

---------21:01----------
[Music]

---------21:14----------
so I have my little ghetto wire

---------21:23----------
we should see if I can ever fix my

---------21:25----------
guitar tripod

---------21:26----------
[Music]

---------21:33----------
seriously tripod

---------21:43----------
you think I was holding the camera but

---------21:45----------
that's actually the tripod all right so

---------21:47----------
we're going from finding nonmetallic

---------21:50----------
instrument disappointing with

---------21:58----------
the output of a 5 volt transistor

---------22:05----------
to their little wire to this zero ohm

---------22:10----------
resistor that I think is zero all in one

---------22:14----------
home or something like that that I just

---------22:15----------
grabbed that then goes through this

---------22:18----------
little pathway to the first pen of the

---------22:20----------
inverter connector and now we have

---------22:23----------
voltage why did that flow up in the

---------22:25----------
first place I have no idea

---------22:28----------
but what I do know is that I now get to

---------22:30----------
collect once I clean this up and you

---------22:33----------
know

---------22:34----------
that's water that's 200 bucks so I'm

---------22:38----------
happy
