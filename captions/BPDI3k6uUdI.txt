---------00:00----------
$300 to see balls hey everybody how's it

---------00:03----------
going so today we're gonna get started

---------00:05----------
working on yet another MacBook here we

---------00:07----------
have an 814 66 let's figure out what's

---------00:09----------
wrong with it and see if we can make it

---------00:11----------
work again

---------00:12----------
cleaning off this MacBook this person's

---------00:17----------
password is seriously hippity-hoppity

---------00:19----------
abolished private property I'm going to

---------00:22----------
guess that this customer lives in

---------00:24----------
Cambridge Massachusetts

---------00:26----------
let's see Cambridge Massachusetts

---------00:27----------
Cambridge Massachusetts

---------00:29----------
let's see out of sheer curiosity holy

---------00:34----------
[ __ ] is it far off

---------00:35----------
ok Somerville they must commute the

---------00:38----------
Cambridge for work Wow

---------00:41----------
commie interesting choice and computer

---------00:44----------
for a commie

---------00:44----------
but whatever could've bottle the note

---------00:47----------
always could have got on the note well

---------00:50----------
we're not prejudiced here anyway let's

---------00:54----------
go back to this

---------01:13----------
are we installing 5g antennas on these

---------01:16----------
MacBooks yet you know I think that would

---------01:19----------
be fun I kind of wonder if I did that

---------01:23----------
and they sent them out how long would it

---------01:24----------
be until I had someone try to knock down

---------01:27----------
the store like they do the towers that

---------01:30----------
would be incredibly fun I think that

---------01:33----------
would be an actually an amazing troll I

---------01:37----------
kind of want to stop what I'm doing to

---------01:39----------
set that up okay 5g made the virus I

---------01:45----------
don't believe that's true okay

---------01:54----------
700 milliamps 5g does not cause kovat 5g

---------02:04----------
causes your phone battery to die quicker

---------02:08----------
when your phone battery dies quicker you

---------02:12----------
are stressed because you don't have your

---------02:14----------
phone when you are stressed your immune

---------02:18----------
system works worse when your immune

---------02:20----------
system works worse you contract colvett

---------02:23----------
19 colvett is caused by 5g

---------02:32----------
kovat took your job eight point five

---------02:36----------
volt so we're not boosting kovat took

---------02:41----------
your freaking

---------02:58----------
let's take a look at this board under

---------03:00----------
the microscope all right now as you can

---------03:02----------
see there is a tiny bit of corrosion on

---------03:07----------
the top of this LP 8550 and watch this I

---------03:11----------
can now zoom in all the way with my new

---------03:14----------
toy fancy-schmancy microscope light here

---------03:17----------
I'll show ya isn't this cool watch this

---------03:23----------
you can see all the way under the chip

---------03:26----------
now

---------03:37----------
look at that

---------03:44----------
that's detail

---------03:53----------
I don't know if it was worth paying

---------03:54----------
three hundred ten bucks for a light but

---------03:57----------
that's detail that's cool you can see

---------03:59----------
how the ball dissolved in everything

---------04:02----------
there we go

---------04:09----------
$300 to see balls and it's cheaper porn

---------04:15----------
out there so we're gonna replace this

---------04:18----------
chip this is a CD 32:15 wait no this is

---------04:23----------
an LP 8550 yeah I'm stuck in touch bar

---------04:26----------
mode this is not a CD 3215 do not put a

---------04:28----------
CD 3250 near this board does have a CD

---------04:31----------
32 oh I believe CD 3211 right over here

---------04:34----------
so I got a little confused they saw that

---------04:36----------
in the corner

---------05:00----------
5g causes meteorite strikes what

---------05:08----------
Wow looks like there was a little bit of

---------05:10----------
food under there did you see that it

---------05:14----------
looks like food under there kovat causes

---------05:18----------
5g says Mateus what that's ridiculous

---------05:39----------
that is ridiculous I'm gonna get myself

---------05:42----------
an LP 8550 from store awesome group calm

---------05:45----------
be right back

---------07:33----------
just a no BS bug

---------07:38----------
you go to hell and you die Jay Kurtz

---------08:02----------
all right let's see if we have a

---------08:03----------
backlight on this beautiful beautiful

---------08:05----------
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful

---------08:06----------
MacBook in debating whether or not I've

---------08:09----------
earned a burrito today hey to reinstall

---------08:12----------
my whole system from scratch and deal

---------08:14----------
with the city fine of 5k do I deserve a

---------08:17----------
burrito have I earned burrito maybe

---------08:24----------
maybe not

---------08:29----------
haven't had a breed on a while

---------08:33----------
kind of debating it trying to lose

---------08:37----------
weight get in better shape a burrito is

---------08:41----------
would make me happy but I shouldn't be

---------08:43----------
the type of person that is made happy by

---------08:46----------
food that's not healthy so I am going to

---------08:54----------
punch this thing if I don't see a

---------08:56----------
question mark fold a question mark

---------08:57----------
folder look at that easy no backlight

---------09:02----------
you jealous Paul I know Paul is jealous

---------09:09----------
Paul's jealous hey I picked this one at

---------09:16----------
random you should see the last note back

---------09:19----------
let I have so what I did here is I

---------09:21----------
replace the backlight driver chip which

---------09:24----------
you can get at store dot Rossman

---------09:26----------
group.com that's it for today in as

---------09:29----------
always I hope that you learned something

---------09:32----------
Elin launched the test effect today

---------09:34----------
against law and started production info

---------09:36----------
from his Twitter 2200 Tesla produced

---------09:38----------
already says one employee he says her

---------09:40----------
asked me first

---------09:41----------
so was this bold move or I mean

---------09:44----------
somebody's got to do it the problem is

---------09:47----------
that here's here's my worry and it's

---------09:49----------
something that I discussed in a video

---------09:50----------
that I have to edit an upload I don't

---------09:54----------
know what any of these company of these

---------09:56----------
states is plan is for actual lock down

---------09:59----------
reopening if they said here's the thing

---------10:02----------
if they said listen we need hospital

---------10:06----------
occupant right now hospital occupancy is

---------10:08----------
like 110 120 % we need to go back to

---------10:10----------
7:00 if once we see 75% hospital

---------10:13----------
occupancy we can test 50,000 people a

---------10:15----------
day and we see that mortality rate is

---------10:18----------
under 2% then we will reopen we will

---------10:23----------
have as a deadline to make this decision

---------10:25----------
May 15th if that if that's not happened

---------10:29----------
by May 15th then lockdown continues on

---------10:31----------
so may 30th on May 30th then we will

---------10:33----------
revisit and then we will see and if it

---------10:35----------
did not done then we were visit on June

---------10:37----------
15th and so on and so forth I think you

---------10:39----------
get people that were willing to go ahead

---------10:41----------
with a lockdown the problem is that

---------10:44----------
there's no real metric for reopening

---------10:46----------
it's not

---------10:47----------
once we hit this point then we will

---------10:49----------
reopen cuz I get it you can't come up

---------10:51----------
with a day as to when you're gonna

---------10:52----------
reopen that's fine I understand you

---------10:54----------
don't have enough data you didn't make

---------10:56----------
the virus you don't know how it's gonna

---------10:57----------
go how could you say we reopen on this

---------10:59----------
day you can't do that but what you can

---------11:01----------
do is you can come up with the metrics

---------11:03----------
that you're going to use to figure out

---------11:05----------
if you're going to make the decision to

---------11:07----------
reopen or not at least come out with the

---------11:09----------
metrics and say on this day we will look

---------11:11----------
at the data if the data says X we do

---------11:14----------
phase one if the data says Z we don't do

---------11:18----------
phase one and then after you do phase

---------11:21----------
one then you look at the data again if

---------11:22----------
the data says this we do that but they

---------11:24----------
don't have any of that we have this

---------11:26----------
silliness of if we save one human life

---------11:29----------
then it's worth it's a we don't that

---------11:32----------
that's not how we do anything we don't

---------11:35----------
do anything like that just look at the

---------11:38----------
look at the bike rides that I do with

---------11:41----------
the [ __ ] crazy ass uber drivers that

---------11:42----------
almost hit me on a regular basis they

---------11:44----------
don't we don't make decisions based on

---------11:46----------
one human life we make decisions based

---------11:47----------
on the aggregate what is best overall

---------11:52----------
for 380 million people not what's best

---------11:54----------
for one person now I'm not trying to be

---------11:56----------
callous but I'm saying you count for

---------11:59----------
something we may disagree on numbers you

---------12:01----------
may say you want hospital capacity to go

---------12:03----------
down to this you may say that you want

---------12:05----------
to be able to test this many people a

---------12:06----------
day come up with whatever metrics you

---------12:08----------
want and say that once we have reached

---------12:10----------
these then we will consider reopening

---------12:12----------
and say that this is the deadline that

---------12:13----------
we have to reach those metrics by or say

---------12:15----------
this is the date at which we will make a

---------12:17----------
decision we don't even have that we

---------12:20----------
don't even have that so the reason that

---------12:21----------
people are getting antsy and uppity

---------12:23----------
about it is you're ruining their lives

---------12:26----------
you're clearly ruining their lives

---------12:28----------
you're ruining businesses you're ruining

---------12:31----------
what people spend ten or fifteen or

---------12:33----------
twenty or thirty years building from

---------12:35----------
nothing that you're not gonna compensate

---------12:38----------
them for properly and you're not even

---------12:40----------
saying we're in this together to

---------12:42----------
accomplish this set goal you're ruining

---------12:45----------
everything and saying we'll we'll see as

---------12:48----------
we go what what happens but don't don't

---------12:50----------
you don't you criticize us because then

---------12:51----------
you don't care about life and that's

---------12:53----------
what pisses me off because the thing

---------12:55----------
it's kind of like if the 1% of this good

---------12:57----------
tweet and I'm sorry that I can't credit

---------12:58----------
them I forgot their name somebody will

---------13:00----------
be able to credit

---------13:01----------
credit them for this I didn't come up

---------13:03----------
with this is that you know when you're

---------13:05----------
waiting for the Train even if it says

---------13:07----------
train coming in 25 or 39 minutes

---------13:09----------
you're okay sitting there in the cold

---------13:12----------
with you know the bums that are fighting

---------13:15----------
you know like a few yards from you and

---------13:17----------
the kids screaming and the fact that

---------13:20----------
it's like 27 degrees outside you'll sit

---------13:22----------
there for 39 minutes as long as you see

---------13:25----------
that little thing that keeps ticking hey

---------13:27----------
each minute away and telling you the

---------13:28----------
train is coming but if you don't know

---------13:30----------
that the train is coming then you say

---------13:32----------
[ __ ] this I'm not waiting for this I'm

---------13:33----------
not I'm not I'm not playing along

---------13:35----------
anymore you need to know what the

---------13:38----------
progress of something is or at the very

---------13:39----------
least you need to know what it is you're

---------13:40----------
working for together if you're waiting

---------13:42----------
for a bus and you've been waiting for 20

---------13:44----------
minutes and it doesn't show up and you

---------13:45----------
have no sign whatsoever if it's gonna

---------13:47----------
come and not you're gonna be much more

---------13:49----------
anxious than you are if you know it's

---------13:51----------
coming and you got that little

---------13:52----------
indication and what's pissing people off

---------13:55----------
here is that we don't know what metrics

---------13:58----------
they're using to make these decisions we

---------13:59----------
don't know what just like what I do with

---------14:02----------
business is very simple what I do is

---------14:04----------
regardless of how miserable something is

---------14:06----------
I draw out a little tree for myself and

---------14:08----------
I say if this happens I do this if that

---------14:10----------
happens I do that I will know by this

---------14:13----------
date what decision I make we can argue

---------14:15----------
until we're blue in the face what the

---------14:17----------
date should be we can argue until we're

---------14:18----------
blue in the face what it is we should

---------14:20----------
actually do but the one thing that is

---------14:22----------
easy to agree on is that once we have it

---------14:25----------
set down heat we will make the decision

---------14:28----------
at this date this way or that way based

---------14:31----------
on data we can argue over what the

---------14:33----------
little pieces of data are we can argue

---------14:34----------
over what we do but one thing that

---------14:36----------
everyone is clear on is on this date we

---------14:38----------
are going to do something and what's

---------14:41----------
pissing people off at a lockdown

---------14:42----------
rightfully so is there's none of that

---------14:45----------
and I'm one of those people that does

---------14:47----------
care I'm like everybody here thinks that

---------14:49----------
I'm ridiculous everybody here thinks

---------14:51----------
that I have OCD because I am cleaning

---------14:53----------
things like a madman every time someone

---------14:55----------
walks in I have this gigantic freaking

---------14:58----------
loud deafening air filter everybody's

---------15:00----------
wearing a mask and require to wear a

---------15:01----------
mask I'm requiring the customers to wear

---------15:03----------
our masks

---------15:04----------
I have people staying home if they know

---------15:08----------
someone that is elderly or

---------15:09----------
immunodeficient and paying them I'm

---------15:13----------
taking this as seriously as

---------15:15----------
possible and then when I bring this up

---------15:17----------
people will say we'll try to make it

---------15:19----------
sound like I'm the same as the people

---------15:21----------
that are saying everybody should go out

---------15:23----------
I shouldn't have to wear a mask wearing

---------15:25----------
a mask is like fake virus planned emic

---------15:28----------
and that that's kind of what pisses me

---------15:29----------
off well it is a virus it's it's it is a

---------15:32----------
virus and it does it does kill people I

---------15:35----------
mean you know like I know someone who

---------15:38----------
got it seems like you know Eugene

---------15:40----------
contracted Corona and it seems to have

---------15:42----------
affected him badly sorry I was just

---------15:44----------
shedding a tear over there

---------15:45----------
but the point is you know it's a real

---------15:47----------
virus I'm taking it seriously but it's

---------15:49----------
hard for me to take your response to it

---------15:51----------
seriously when you're not open with the

---------15:53----------
public just like moving you said you

---------15:55----------
wouldn't pick a date to move you would

---------15:56----------
move when you found the place not push

---------15:57----------
to find a date by by a certain date yes

---------16:00----------
but I had a place to use here you're say

---------16:03----------
imagine if I didn't have a place at all

---------16:05----------
that's not a working analogy I said I

---------16:07----------
would find a place when I have I have

---------16:09----------
the luxury of waiting until I have the

---------16:12----------
perfect space because I have a space

---------16:14----------
right now that 12 people are working out

---------16:16----------
of that's working just fine for all of

---------16:17----------
them now if someone comes in and kicks

---------16:20----------
us all out on the street are we gonna be

---------16:22----------
in a bit more of a hurry to get a space

---------16:23----------
the problem too that says the additional

---------16:26----------
list the data says that's a big part of

---------16:31----------
the problem indeed Michigan appears like

---------16:34----------
a mess as well so there's unemployment

---------16:35----------
where let's say you're laid off you

---------16:37----------
you're able to get certain unemployment

---------16:39----------
benefits but if you quit a job of your

---------16:41----------
own volition in a certain period of time

---------16:42----------
there are people that are saying that

---------16:44----------
they're not able to apply for the

---------16:46----------
unemployment so if I work for you when

---------16:48----------
you're a [ __ ] and I decide [ __ ] you I

---------16:49----------
quit I'm gonna go work somewhere else

---------16:51----------
and then I worked somewhere else and I

---------16:53----------
get along with my boss very well and I

---------16:55----------
make him money and I do a good job and

---------16:56----------
he likes my work but he lays me off

---------16:58----------
because the governor said everybody has

---------17:00----------
to close now I can't collect

---------17:01----------
unemployment that's an interesting one I

---------17:03----------
worry from my 72 year old mother has

---------17:06----------
respiratory issues I worry for the old

---------17:08----------
two I think that there should be put in

---------17:10----------
place some sort of system whereby if you

---------17:12----------
are immunodeficient there is some sort

---------17:14----------
of program set aside for you so that you

---------17:17----------
have don't have that economic necessity

---------17:20----------
to leave the house and risk dying during

---------17:23----------
this time if you're afraid come up with

---------17:25----------
something like that because like the way

---------17:27----------
I'm doing business right

---------17:29----------
everybody here is in that category where

---------17:31----------
their mortality rate that is at the

---------17:33----------
store is like zero point zero zero zero

---------17:35----------
zero whatever you know nobody here has

---------17:37----------
bad health underlying health issues and

---------17:39----------
we're all in our 20s some of us in our

---------17:42----------
30s

---------17:43----------
Paul's a grandpa he just turned 40 but

---------17:45----------
even Paul and I ride a bike here and

---------17:48----------
then I ride a bike home I don't see

---------17:50----------
anybody in between I don't I'm not next

---------17:52----------
to anybody on that way home and at home

---------17:54----------
I live with my girlfriend who is 31 so

---------17:56----------
if you are elderly or you are

---------17:59----------
immunocompromised and you're at your

---------18:01----------
home there's not really much way even if

---------18:04----------
I was carrying this virus that I have a

---------18:06----------
means of spreading it to you because I'm

---------18:09----------
not coming into contact with you I'm not

---------18:11----------
next to you I'm not near you now

---------18:13----------
something could be said for forcing

---------18:16----------
people to go out or not having the

---------18:18----------
resources available that would allow

---------18:19----------
people who are elderly or

---------18:20----------
immunocompromised to stay in their home

---------18:22----------
at this time I also hear that by going

---------18:24----------
out I could be spreading things even if

---------18:26----------
the person staying home but if that

---------18:27----------
person is staying home and they are

---------18:29----------
relying on food delivery and they're

---------18:31----------
relying on you you know other types of

---------18:33----------
delivery in order to get everything

---------18:35----------
because they can't go to the grocery

---------18:36----------
store at some point there is the risk of

---------18:38----------
infection just based just by the person

---------18:40----------
who's actually doing the delivery the

---------18:42----------
biggest worry for his employees are

---------18:43----------
getting run over by a truck yeah but I

---------18:45----------
mean if someone is immunocompromised or

---------18:47----------
elderly and I literally ride in a little

---------18:50----------
little straight line from here from my

---------18:52----------
apartment to here and I don't stop

---------18:53----------
anywhere else and then I run into this

---------18:55----------
office I don't see how I am risking

---------18:59----------
infecting any older or immunocompromised

---------19:02----------
people if they are staying home really

---------19:06----------
because like for example my landlord is

---------19:07----------
in his 70s my landlord is at risk my

---------19:11----------
landlord is also up there he is staying

---------19:13----------
at home he told me that he is saying

---------19:15----------
self quarantine at home not going

---------19:18----------
anywhere

---------19:18----------
even if I have Corona and I start

---------19:20----------
coughing and going uh-huh uh-huh the

---------19:23----------
virus doesn't travel through drywall so

---------19:25----------
me coming to work does not affect him

---------19:27----------
because as much as I coughed even if I

---------19:29----------
wasn't wearing this mask it doesn't go

---------19:32----------
through drywall it doesn't go through

---------19:34----------
brick it doesn't go through shingle so

---------19:36----------
if you stay at home you'll be good now

---------19:38----------
the point of the lockdown was don't

---------19:41----------
overwhelm the healthcare system

---------19:42----------
flatten the curve figure out what the

---------19:45----------
[ __ ] going on we've had two months man

---------19:48----------
if we haven't figured out what's going

---------19:49----------
on by now than whatever curve has been

---------19:53----------
flattened the comfort has sailed away

---------19:55----------
the Javits Center is not filled with

---------19:57----------
people by the way it should have been

---------19:58----------
filled two people that had that that

---------20:01----------
were elderly rather than shoving them

---------20:02----------
back in nursing homes my governors are

---------20:03----------
stupid [ __ ] we didn't do that but

---------20:05----------
anyway the Javits Center is not overrun

---------20:07----------
the comfort is sailed away that ship

---------20:09----------
that was a nice hospital ship that was

---------20:11----------
brought up here sailed away hospitals

---------20:14----------
are gaining their capacity back which

---------20:17----------
then begs the question so of all the

---------20:19----------
original goals all of those original

---------20:21----------
goals have been met

---------20:22----------
here we're still in lockdown now if you

---------20:24----------
had expressed different goals

---------20:26----------
if you said we're waiting to this date

---------20:27----------
for this data then people wouldn't be

---------20:30----------
getting antsy but the reason in New York

---------20:32----------
City that when you go to a park you see

---------20:33----------
a bunch of people outside without their

---------20:35----------
masks playing basketball the reason you

---------20:37----------
see them ignoring you is because you

---------20:40----------
didn't state a clear goal you didn't say

---------20:42----------
that on this date we were gonna make

---------20:44----------
this decision based on this data you

---------20:46----------
just said we're gonna lock down because

---------20:48----------
of this this finished and you continued

---------20:51----------
it I know that's about it for that

---------20:54----------
people have been infected through

---------20:56----------
ventilation systems this is New York

---------20:58----------
City

---------20:58----------
we don't have ventilation here it up

---------21:02----------
there I can't between me and him are you

---------21:05----------
kidding me you haven't been to a New

---------21:09----------
York City office that costs under 20,000

---------21:11----------
a month now have you but you coffin the

---------21:14----------
postman no I

---------21:16----------
the postman sometimes earns getting

---------21:19----------
coughed on but I haven't done that I

---------21:20----------
haven't done that David you're saying

---------21:24----------
that all the states that don't want open

---------21:26----------
up Democratic governors but I don't see

---------21:27----------
it as a Democrat issue it's all of the

---------21:30----------
cities that have so this this is kind of

---------21:31----------
like the 5g tower thing where people

---------21:33----------
will say that 5g towers cause kovat

---------21:36----------
because all the places with lots of 5g

---------21:38----------
towers are the places that have a lot of

---------21:39----------
kovat 5g towers are economically viable

---------21:42----------
in areas with high population density

---------21:44----------
also all the places with high population

---------21:46----------
density or democrat run so it's more the

---------21:50----------
cultural issue that

---------21:52----------
that is that it's not how about this

---------21:54----------
it's the cultural aspect that in America

---------21:57----------
places with high population density tend

---------21:59----------
to be more liberal it's not that it's

---------22:01----------
purely Democrats that are deciding to

---------22:02----------
reopen if you have a lower population

---------22:04----------
density you're going to have a lower

---------22:07----------
rate of transmission less spread less to

---------22:10----------
worry about therefore you can reopen

---------22:13----------
sooner if you live in a densely

---------22:15----------
populated city it is very likely that

---------22:17----------
you are mayor or your governor is a

---------22:19----------
Democrat because that's just the way it

---------22:21----------
is so if you have more population

---------22:24----------
density you need to take the disease or

---------22:26----------
the virus more seriously than you would

---------22:28----------
and let's say Custer South Dakota I'm

---------22:31----------
not saying that South you know Custer is

---------22:33----------
not a great place but when you look at

---------22:34----------
the population density and let's say

---------22:36----------
Custer South Dakota or some place in

---------22:37----------
Wyoming the reason that they're not

---------22:40----------
being as strict with lockdowns it's not

---------22:44----------
Republican versus Democrat it's one

---------22:46----------
person every mile versus one person

---------22:49----------
every foot kind of thing

---------22:50----------
someone's gonna edit that and they're

---------22:53----------
just gonna take out one bit that says 5g

---------22:55----------
causes kovat and I'm he wouldn't pass

---------22:59----------
the world anyway

---------23:02----------
and for me the stakes are different

---------23:05----------
because I still have a business you know

---------23:07----------
Emperor Cuomo declare that technical

---------23:10----------
support is essential so I'm still here I

---------23:13----------
am still open I'm still taken in

---------23:16----------
business whether or not they get rid of

---------23:18----------
the stay-at-home order I'm still gonna

---------23:19----------
leave the people that are

---------23:21----------
immunocompromised or living with the

---------23:24----------
elderly home for a while so like it

---------23:25----------
doesn't affect me that much it affects

---------23:27----------
other people

---------23:28----------
because Elon is in a different position

---------23:30----------
than I am you know Elon if Elon is not

---------23:33----------
able to open his factory that's

---------23:34----------
different like he's genuinely losing

---------23:36----------
[ __ ] tons of money whereas for me it's

---------23:38----------
just you know minor drop in business

---------23:40----------
people are home all the time if they're

---------23:43----------
home all the time they're moment that's

---------23:45----------
an additional eight hours a day that

---------23:46----------
they have to [ __ ] up their MacBook so

---------23:48----------
you know now you may say well people are

---------23:51----------
not gonna have money to get repairs if

---------23:53----------
they don't have jobs but people know

---------23:55----------
it's gonna be people don't have money to

---------23:56----------
buy a new one therefore they have to fix

---------23:57----------
the old one like for me economically

---------23:59----------
speaking I don't really

---------24:01----------
it's not affecting me in the same way

---------24:03----------
that it's affecting others I would

---------24:05----------
probably be much more biased I would

---------24:08----------
imagine I'd be more biased towards

---------24:09----------
wanting to reopen sooner if I actually

---------24:11----------
couldn't work but I mean this is my

---------24:13----------
opinion as someone who can work and I'm

---------24:15----------
mentioning this because I remember

---------24:16----------
saying we're at least regarding the

---------24:19----------
vegetarian thing a while back that I

---------24:20----------
never thought about the morality of it

---------24:22----------
until I realized that vegan burrito

---------24:24----------
I could eat a vegan burrito and it

---------24:25----------
wasn't [ __ ] back when I thought it was

---------24:27----------
[ __ ] it changed my my thought process on

---------24:29----------
or a changed what my opinion was and it

---------24:31----------
was entirely changed once I realized

---------24:33----------
once you removed the the pain point from

---------24:37----------
it and here I don't have the pain point

---------24:40----------
of not being able to open my business is

---------24:42----------
open and I still believe that having a

---------24:45----------
lockdown in place without any clear-cut

---------24:46----------
goals any clear-cut dissing deadlines

---------24:52----------
for making decisions based on data is

---------24:56----------
just not good policy are we really

---------24:58----------
arguing in chat whether 5g cause oh my

---------25:02----------
god please stop please stop please stop

---------25:07----------
give me the illusion that I don't at

---------25:10----------
least let me believe in my illusions

---------25:12----------
that I don't have a single fan that

---------25:13----------
thinks 5g causes kovat even if you do

---------25:17----------
even if you believe it can you just do

---------25:18----------
me a favor like just in exchange for all

---------25:21----------
the educational free stuff that you can

---------25:23----------
learn on this channel do me one favor

---------25:25----------
and just pretend that you don't believe

---------25:27----------
that 5g causes kovat just can you do it

---------25:30----------
for me can you do what as a favor

---------25:32----------
kind of like if you if you know if your

---------25:34----------
teenage daughter bangs everybody on the

---------25:36----------
football team it's five times a week but

---------25:39----------
like when she goes home she has the the

---------25:42----------
decency to at least pretend for her dad

---------25:45----------
that she's still that she's not a [ __ ]

---------25:47----------
when the kid goes out and he joy rides

---------25:50----------
motorcycles at the age of 15 and breaks

---------25:52----------
in all these cars and steals them and

---------25:54----------
sells them on the black market but then

---------25:55----------
comes home and just pretends for his

---------25:57----------
parents that he's that innocent kid that

---------25:59----------
used to play Final Fantasy 9 can you

---------26:01----------
pretend for me that you're intelligent

---------26:03----------
enough that you don't think 5g causes

---------26:04----------
ghovat let me say with a straight face

---------26:06----------
that I have an intelligent audience

---------26:08----------
people think 5g spreads corona because

---------26:10----------
their brains are already fried from 4G

---------26:12----------
that's actually the best argument I've

---------26:14----------
heard so far for cell

---------26:15----------
radiation cellphones causing us so

---------26:18----------
that's actually a really good argument

---------26:20----------
so it was for G naught 5 g 5g causes

---------26:23----------
Cova 19 how 5g gives more internet speed

---------26:26----------
which helps spreading this information

---------26:27----------
about kovat 19 okay that's a good one I

---------26:30----------
like that you know what you're starting

---------26:31----------
to get me to believe it too now
