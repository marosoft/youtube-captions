---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going here we

---------00:01----------
have any 1466 MacBook Air

---------00:04----------
that's not powering on let's see if we

---------00:06----------
can open this thing figure out what's

---------00:07----------
wrong with it

---------00:12----------
so now what we do with all of these Mac

---------00:14----------
books is we unplug the battery and then

---------00:18----------
we plug the charger in because if we

---------00:21----------
unplug the battery and then plug the

---------00:23----------
charger in it's gonna show us on the

---------00:25----------
screen how much power the charger is

---------00:26----------
using and that's gonna be a useful

---------00:28----------
number that helps me figure out what's

---------00:30----------
wrong with the computer here it looks

---------00:32----------
like it's taking 6 milliamps a number

---------00:35----------
I'm not used to that typically means

---------00:38----------
that my charger is not making contact

---------00:39----------
with the machine let's see if that's the

---------00:41----------
case though I'm gonna put this in

---------00:44----------
voltage mode and see if anything from

---------00:46----------
here is reaching into the machine

---------00:48----------
actually I can tell before I even do

---------00:51----------
that that it's not and I'll show you how

---------00:53----------
I know that I'm gonna open up a

---------00:56----------
schematic and a board view for the to

---------00:58----------
0-0 0 165 by the way for those of you

---------01:01----------
who always ask me how do you know where

---------01:04----------
the board number is well you need to

---------01:06----------
know the number of the board to know

---------01:07----------
where the board number is because the

---------01:08----------
board number is written in different

---------01:10----------
spaces and every model board so this is

---------01:12----------
really an issue of eyesight because if

---------01:13----------
you're unable to see where the board

---------01:15----------
number is you're probably in the wrong

---------01:17----------
business on this board the reason I

---------01:19----------
ain't know that it's an 8 to 0 - 2 0 0

---------01:21----------
165 is because the number is written

---------01:23----------
right over here where it's clearly

---------01:25----------
visible see 8 - 0 0 0 1 6 5

---------01:31----------
right there so if you're not able to see

---------01:33----------
that you might just be in the wrong

---------01:34----------
industry but let's get back to trying to

---------01:36----------
figure out what's wrong with this board

---------01:38----------
now if you look at it you'll see that

---------01:40----------
there is a teeny tiny bit of corrosion

---------01:41----------
in the corner right over here and we're

---------01:45----------
gonna look at that corrosion and the

---------01:46----------
microscope and I'm gonna show you why it

---------01:49----------
is that this machine is only taking 6

---------01:51----------
mill amps and also just to note if

---------01:54----------
you've been watching regularly you know

---------01:56----------
that I try to troubleshoot the board and

---------01:57----------
figure out what's wrong with the board

---------01:59----------
by taking a look and at how many

---------02:01----------
milliamp it's taking on the charger when

---------02:05----------
I plug it in so now if you've been a

---------02:07----------
regular viewer you know I'm going to add

---------02:08----------
to my list that 6 milliamps is it gonna

---------02:11----------
mean a problem with the input

---------02:13----------
of the pp3 before - circuit so let's

---------02:15----------
take a look at that area and see if you

---------02:18----------
can tell me what you see going on

---------02:21----------
it's corrosion over there but there's

---------02:23----------
one particular piece of corrosion that's

---------02:25----------
going to be the corrosion that matters

---------02:27----------
and it's gonna be the corrosion that

---------02:28----------
stops power from flowing through to

---------02:30----------
anything on this MacBook and it's going

---------02:33----------
to be this up diode right over here I'm

---------02:36----------
simply gonna brush a little bit on on

---------02:38----------
that diode like so and then I'm gonna

---------02:42----------
take a little q-tip belong that diode

---------02:46----------
like this and there's a good chance that

---------02:51----------
this computer is now going to turn on

---------02:55----------
let me show you why in the schematic

---------02:57----------
while I wait for my alcohol to dry so

---------03:00----------
I'm gonna open up a schematic and a

---------03:03----------
board view to an eight to zero - is zero

---------03:06----------
zero one sixty five board and you'll all

---------03:09----------
be able to follow along with me we're

---------03:12----------
going to find that chip the pp three

---------03:15----------
before to underscore g3 hawk creator use

---------03:18----------
70 90 and we're gonna move the PDF over

---------03:21----------
to it so this is the power supply for

---------03:28----------
3.42 volt rail that's required to power

---------03:32----------
the system management controller the

---------03:34----------
system management controller is powered

---------03:36----------
by three point 42 volts that's going to

---------03:38----------
be what turns the charger on that's

---------03:40----------
gonna be what allows the ISO six two

---------03:42----------
five nine that creates 50 brush g3 hot

---------03:44----------
the main power off for the system to

---------03:45----------
work nothing in the system can work if

---------03:47----------
3.42 volts doesn't work now it has an

---------03:51----------
input over here remember this is going

---------03:52----------
to be have to be powered on on battery

---------03:55----------
or charger it's the only rail in the

---------03:57----------
system that needs to be powered by the

---------03:58----------
battery or the charger which means that

---------04:01----------
it's going to have multiple inputs so

---------04:04----------
when you take a look over here this is

---------04:06----------
in but that input can be powered by

---------04:09----------
either pp bus g3 hot or PP 80 and v5 dcn

---------04:13----------
Wow so you have two different ways of

---------04:16----------
powering it PV bus g3 hop which is a

---------04:18----------
battery or 18 volts which is going to be

---------04:21----------
from the charger this over here is going

---------04:24----------
to be the charge port J 7000

---------04:26----------
now you have a diode over here the

---------04:29----------
reason is that PV bus g3 hot is a power

---------04:31----------
rail that comes from the battery or if

---------04:34----------
the battery is dead or not plugged in

---------04:36----------
it's created by the ISL 65:9 chip by the

---------04:38----------
charger you don't want 18 volts going to

---------04:42----------
your battery assembly because they're

---------04:43----------
tied to the same input so you have a

---------04:45----------
diode over here that presents the 18

---------04:47----------
volts from the charger and going into PV

---------04:50----------
bus g3 hub now when it comes to the

---------04:51----------
charger it does charger is not hooked up

---------04:54----------
directly to the input of the pp 3 before

---------04:56----------
2 circuit the charger is hooked up to

---------04:59----------
something else if you take a look over

---------05:01----------
here the charger goes to a transistor q7

---------05:06----------
t 10 now this here is what's called a

---------05:08----------
p-channel MOSFET if you're unsure what a

---------05:11----------
p-channel versus an n-channel is i'll

---------05:14----------
explain and if you're unsure of how to

---------05:16----------
tell a p-channel from an n-channel i

---------05:17----------
would suggest that you simply google the

---------05:20----------
name of the transistor not this name not

---------05:23----------
q7 t 10 s i5 4 1 9 q7 t10 doesn't

---------05:28----------
actually mean anything so imagine if I

---------05:31----------
said dad do you know where mom is dad

---------05:34----------
would know who I'm talking about because

---------05:36----------
I'm talking about my mother

---------05:38----------
and that has a relationship to him

---------05:40----------
because I'm his son

---------05:42----------
whereas if I go into a hotel lobby and I

---------05:44----------
asked the attendant have you seen my

---------05:46----------
mother that doesn't mean anything to him

---------05:48----------
he doesn't know who mom is he needs to

---------05:50----------
know are you looking for Donna Pomponio

---------05:52----------
then he'll know that I was looking for

---------05:54----------
my mother over here the same principle

---------05:57----------
applies q70 10 only means something to

---------06:00----------
this particular Apple motherboard but

---------06:02----------
the actual name of the component is s i5

---------06:05----------
4 o 190 you and if you google that

---------06:08----------
you'll see that it is a p-channel MOSFET

---------06:10----------
the reason it's important to know a

---------06:11----------
p-channel MOSFET from an n-channel

---------06:13----------
mosfet is that a p-channel mosfet is

---------06:16----------
going to open when the voltage in the

---------06:18----------
gate is lower than the voltage in the

---------06:20----------
source whereas an n-channel mosfet is

---------06:22----------
going to open when the voltage in the

---------06:24----------
gate is equal to or higher than the

---------06:26----------
source knowing what the expected

---------06:28----------
behavior is of the chip is going to

---------06:30----------
allow you to understand if there's a

---------06:31----------
malfunction with it so this is a

---------06:33----------
p-channel which means that this is not

---------06:35----------
going to allow any power to go from the

---------06:37----------
source of the drain unless the voltage

---------06:39----------
in the gate is

---------06:40----------
lower think of this like a light switch

---------06:41----------
source the drain is like the in-and-out

---------06:43----------
of a light switch and the gate is kind

---------06:45----------
of like the position of the switch

---------06:46----------
whether it's on or off if you have

---------06:49----------
voltage at the gate that's lower than

---------06:50----------
the source the light switch turns on if

---------06:52----------
you have voltage at the gate that's

---------06:53----------
equal to or higher than the source the

---------06:55----------
light switch turns off so knowing that

---------06:58----------
this is only going to open when the

---------06:59----------
voltage when the gate is lower than the

---------07:01----------
source let's take a look and see how

---------07:03----------
this is set up so it looks like we have

---------07:05----------
a resistor over here between the source

---------07:08----------
and the gate these resistors are not

---------07:12----------
going to drop voltage they're simply

---------07:14----------
going to drop the amount of current that

---------07:15----------
can flow through which means that the 18

---------07:17----------
volts from the source is always going to

---------07:19----------
be present on the gate meaning this will

---------07:21----------
never open unless we give the gate a

---------07:23----------
path to ground if we give the gate the

---------07:26----------
path to ground which is what we do over

---------07:28----------
here see this d7 t12 that means that

---------07:32----------
some of that voltage is going to go to

---------07:34----------
ground meaning that we're not going to

---------07:36----------
have 18 volts in the gate this diode to

---------07:39----------
ground is not going to affect the

---------07:40----------
voltage at the source because you have a

---------07:42----------
hundred kilo ohm resistor isolating the

---------07:45----------
current flow between the source and

---------07:49----------
ground however it will affect what's

---------07:52----------
going on at the gate so you'll see that

---------07:55----------
the diode is the path to ground and if

---------07:58----------
you look over here on the actual board

---------08:01----------
view you'll see that d7 t12 is going to

---------08:04----------
be that very component that we saw

---------08:07----------
having the most corrosion on it right

---------08:15----------
here d7 t12

---------08:21----------
now we were able to clean that diode

---------08:23----------
with a q-tip and since we've cleaned the

---------08:26----------
diode with a q-tip it's probably going

---------08:28----------
to work again where it is gonna do a

---------08:33----------
little bit more over here and we'll

---------08:35----------
touch this up with them solder at the

---------08:36----------
end of course we're not gonna leave a

---------08:37----------
board like this with little corroded

---------08:40----------
stuff stuck on it when a customer

---------08:42----------
trusted us over the Apple Store with

---------08:45----------
their machine their data and their money

---------08:49----------
but just for testing purposes I'm kind

---------08:53----------
of curious to see if the q-tip is able

---------08:56----------
to solve the problem that the genius

---------08:58----------
wasn't

---------09:15----------
let's get that alcohol to flow away

---------09:22----------
now we're going to plug our charger back

---------09:26----------
in and see if this works

---------09:29----------
I'm gonna turn on the power supply

---------09:32----------
software so you could see it on the

---------09:33----------
screen and we plug it in and we get a

---------09:36----------
green light in 500 milliamps of usage

---------09:39----------
from the charger as well as a fan spin

---------09:41----------
meaning that this machine now works

---------09:45----------
Apple but you quoted this woman $750

---------09:54----------
$750 I fix this with a q-tip what we're

---------10:00----------
gonna do is we're going to put the

---------10:03----------
proper amount of flux and this is gonna

---------10:09----------
help fix the integrity of those solder

---------10:13----------
joints

---------10:19----------
[Music]

---------10:25----------
[Music]

---------10:39----------
okay

---------10:41----------
now what I'm gonna do with that diode

---------10:43----------
just to make sure that I get a good job

---------10:46----------
done on it is I'm going to tap it what

---------10:50----------
this is gonna do is it's gonna move the

---------10:51----------
solder around in the little ball that

---------10:53----------
it's in in a little solder ball

---------10:59----------
and it means that the corrosion is

---------11:02----------
probably gonna get bounced out of it

---------11:03----------
which is exactly what I want which means

---------11:06----------
that not only is it gonna be you know I

---------11:08----------
kinda half their connection but it's

---------11:10----------
gonna be as good as it was prior to the

---------11:12----------
liquid damage and that one resistor that

---------11:15----------
looks like it could be a little bit

---------11:16----------
nicer they're gonna file that with my

---------11:19----------
pack o 2032 tip and my t30 KN tip on the

---------11:25----------
2032 I see that we're just gonna redo

---------11:28----------
that joint like that scrape a little so

---------11:30----------
that any of the corrosion leaves and do

---------11:32----------
the same thing for the other side of

---------11:33----------
that resistor and it'll be like it was

---------11:38----------
never corroded

---------11:46----------
[Music]

---------11:52----------
anywhere I see that kind of reddish rust

---------11:55----------
looking junk who are going to take this

---------11:58----------
tip which is shaped perfectly to the

---------12:01----------
sides of these qfn ships and file back

---------12:07----------
and forth with the flux there and just

---------12:10----------
file now if you can see that it looks

---------12:14----------
like this corrosion under it then you

---------12:15----------
take the chip off but if it's not this

---------12:18----------
will do the job and any of these pro

---------12:20----------
points that look like they're a little

---------12:21----------
rusted or the resistor is gonna be

---------12:23----------
communicating with the chip or sending

---------12:25----------
voltage to the chip scrape scrape scrape

---------12:29----------
and there we go this machine is likely

---------12:32----------
going to be good until the end of time

---------12:34----------
until the user decides that they're

---------12:36----------
gonna spill more liquid into it

---------12:37----------
remember your MacBook is not thirsty now

---------12:41----------
we're going to see if this thing gives

---------12:42----------
us a questionmark folder on the screen

---------12:44----------
once it turns on

---------12:55----------
as you can see we get a question mark

---------12:56----------
folder on the screen meaning that our

---------12:59----------
repair is complete the only thing we

---------13:02----------
have to do at this point is ultrasonic

---------13:04----------
we clean the motherboard to get rid of

---------13:05----------
any corrosion that may be hiding under

---------13:06----------
the chips we have a nice crest P 1200

---------13:09----------
845 over there it's a nice piece of kit

---------13:11----------
it's gonna get it and they sweep

---------13:12----------
frequency ultrasonic it's gonna get

---------13:13----------
under every single chip and remove all

---------13:16----------
the junk from the board and once that's

---------13:18----------
done this will work lovely again and

---------13:20----------
we'll be ready to go back to a happy

---------13:23----------
customer that's it for today and as

---------13:26----------
always I hope you learned something see

---------13:28----------
you in the next video
