---------00:00----------
so today we're gonna be working on an 8

---------00:01----------
to 0 37 87 that has no backlight on the

---------00:06----------
keyboard so we turn it on and I'm just

---------00:08----------
gonna show you what happens inside the

---------00:10----------
operating system it looks like this has

---------00:11----------
already been with to some extent

---------00:13----------
if we look in the microscope camera you

---------00:15----------
will see flux you will see captain tape

---------00:18----------
and you will see signs that I'm not the

---------00:20----------
first one here but we know that we

---------00:22----------
expect that at this point I'm never the

---------00:24----------
first one we don't get backlight for

---------00:26----------
users we don't get like we don't get

---------00:28----------
just Jay tags anymore we never get the

---------00:30----------
easy stuff we only get this stuff that

---------00:33----------
nobody else wants so let's turn this on

---------00:35----------
I'm gonna boot into my operating system

---------00:37----------
and we're going to see what is going on

---------00:40----------
with this machine and the first thing I

---------00:42----------
want to do is I unplug the webcam and

---------00:45----------
the reason I unplug the webcam is

---------00:46----------
because the webcam is also often an

---------00:48----------
ambient light sensor which is how it

---------00:50----------
tells if there's a lot of light in the

---------00:52----------
room and I don't feel like having to

---------00:53----------
remember to cover the webcam if I don't

---------00:55----------
cover the webcam like this then the

---------00:57----------
light won't come on and it can be a

---------00:59----------
little bit of a pain in the ass so we're

---------01:02----------
gonna turn this on and we're gonna boot

---------01:03----------
into a test operating system and the

---------01:05----------
first thing I want to do is see what

---------01:07----------
what does it register when I hit the

---------01:08----------
backlight up and down keys in the

---------01:10----------
keyboard I want to see if it registers

---------01:11----------
anything I want to see if it even knows

---------01:13----------
that I'm hitting the keys at all if it

---------01:15----------
doesn't tell that I'm hitting the keys

---------01:17----------
that's going to be interesting to me all

---------01:19----------
right so we're gonna go inside here and

---------01:21----------
wait what do you mean that's not my

---------01:23----------
password that's my ultimate secure

---------01:25----------
password there right there 1 2 3 4 baby

---------01:27----------
alright so when I turn the brightness up

---------01:31----------
I do get the symbol on the screen I get

---------01:33----------
the brightness symbol which means that

---------01:36----------
it knows that I have a keyboard external

---------01:40----------
keyboard attached and it but the

---------01:43----------
keyboard brightness is not going up

---------01:44----------
there's no light on the keyboard so

---------01:47----------
where would one of you start here on an

---------01:49----------
eight to zero thirty seven eighty seven

---------01:52----------
board that has no keyboard backlight

---------01:55----------
check the backlight coil near the driver

---------01:57----------
okay what am I gonna check at the are

---------02:00----------
you saying check the coil or are you

---------02:01----------
saying check near the coil if you're

---------02:03----------
saying check the coil I'm going to have

---------02:06----------
to give you an internet punch right

---------02:08----------
right in the face

---------02:10----------
if it if you're saying check near the

---------02:12----------
coil that's a good idea so I'm gonna go

---------02:15----------
and check near the coil I'm also gonna

---------02:17----------
see if I missed anything here that

---------02:19----------
doesn't seem like a half all right so

---------02:21----------
let's check near the coil which means

---------02:23----------
minimizing all of the stuff so checking

---------02:27----------
near the coil that's a decent idea no

---------02:29----------
near it it gets five volts all right so

---------02:31----------
let's look go on the screen here and see

---------02:33----------
how this boards now if you don't know

---------02:35----------
what a DC to DC boost circuit is I would

---------02:37----------
highly recommend that you check out my

---------02:38----------
videos and how a DC to DC boost circuit

---------02:40----------
works because that's going to prepare

---------02:42----------
you for for what's going on here so the

---------02:44----------
way a DC to DC boost circuit works long

---------02:46----------
story short if you want to turn let's

---------02:48----------
say five volts which is this into twenty

---------02:50----------
five volts what you do is you send five

---------02:53----------
volts before a coil now the coil is

---------02:55----------
going to store voltage in it because

---------02:56----------
it's round and coiled and so the

---------02:58----------
way this is gonna work is after the coil

---------03:00----------
we are going to short it to ground so

---------03:02----------
right after here we're gonna short it to

---------03:03----------
ground this is gonna be like stopping

---------03:04----------
short in the car so let's say you're

---------03:06----------
driving at twenty miles an hour and you

---------03:07----------
stop short for that quick moment you're

---------03:10----------
gonna jolt forward and you're gonna jolt

---------03:12----------
forward more than the twenty miles an

---------03:14----------
hour so your body is gonna move forward

---------03:16----------
faster than twenty miles an hour that

---------03:18----------
you were that you that you had been a

---------03:20----------
jolt that you were driving prior to the

---------03:22----------
jolt forward and it's like stopping

---------03:24----------
short and the same go holds true

---------03:26----------
for this it's just like stopping short

---------03:28----------
over and over again so when we're told

---------03:29----------
so when we're using a DC to DC booster

---------03:31----------
we can have five volts coming through

---------03:33----------
here after the coil there's going to be

---------03:35----------
something that switches the ground so

---------03:37----------
over here on this chip which is the back

---------03:38----------
light chip we have a SW trace that

---------03:40----------
switch to is the second switch the first

---------03:43----------
one is for a backlight for the LCD

---------03:46----------
screen the second one is going to be

---------03:47----------
switched for the keyboard backlight and

---------03:48----------
that's going to switch it to ground so

---------03:50----------
it's gonna stop short and for a quick

---------03:51----------
second we're going to have a spike of

---------03:53----------
let's say 25 volts or 30 volts instead

---------03:56----------
of 5 because we shorted it to ground

---------03:58----------
which causes the coil to put out bunch

---------04:00----------
of voltage really quickly the same way

---------04:02----------
that stopping short in a car causes you

---------04:03----------
to jump forward really quickly now it

---------04:06----------
would be pretty uncomfortable if

---------04:07----------
somebody kept stopping short hundreds of

---------04:10----------
thousands of times every second right

---------04:11----------
would probably piss you off well that's

---------04:13----------
what we're gonna do the electrons over

---------04:15----------
and over and over again we're gonna

---------04:16----------
 torture those pieces of crap and

---------04:18----------
the way that that's going to happen the

---------04:20----------
way that we're gonna turn that into a

---------04:21----------
higher voltage is we have a diode over

---------04:22----------
here

---------04:23----------
a diode and we have

---------04:24----------
capacitors the capacitors are going to

---------04:26----------
store those spikes of 25 volts so over

---------04:29----------
here you're gonna have spikes of 25

---------04:30----------
volts that get stored in the capacitor

---------04:32----------
is like a battery we have capacitors

---------04:33----------
going to ground the voltage is gonna the

---------04:35----------
DC voltage is gonna try to make its way

---------04:37----------
to ground that's gonna really want to go

---------04:38----------
to ground but not be able to because the

---------04:40----------
capacitor cannot pass DC because it has

---------04:42----------
got that insulator material in the

---------04:44----------
middle so it's gonna get slammed onto

---------04:46----------
this plate over here it's you're gonna

---------04:47----------
have voltage slammed on the plate of the

---------04:49----------
capacitor and it's gonna be stored there

---------04:50----------
while it's trying to go to ground the

---------04:52----------
electrons not only are we torturing them

---------04:54----------
we're also trusting the fact that

---------04:55----------
they're so stupid but they have no idea

---------04:57----------
that there's no way to get to ground

---------04:59----------
they're just gonna keep slamming

---------05:00----------
themselves into the plate so we're gonna

---------05:01----------
have all these pulses at 25 volts stored

---------05:03----------
over here and since we have a diode over

---------05:05----------
here that's only going to allow power to

---------05:06----------
go through one way it's not going to

---------05:09----------
allow the voltage to the 25 volts we

---------05:11----------
store here to go back to ground so we're

---------05:12----------
going to have this switch and just

---------05:15----------
assume let me just get this full screen

---------05:17----------
a little so that you can see better so

---------05:19----------
this over here is going to be the

---------05:21----------
backlight chip this is going to be 5

---------05:23----------
volts coming into the coil the coil is

---------05:25----------
gonna have a lot of 5 volts stored over

---------05:28----------
here then we're going a short to ground

---------05:29----------
on this side which is gonna cause the

---------05:31----------
coil to send these little spikes of 25

---------05:33----------
volts through and because we're trying

---------05:36----------
to rip that voltage that's stored in the

---------05:37----------
coil out as quickly as we can

---------05:39----------
same as stopping short in the car now

---------05:41----------
the the spikes of 25 volts are gonna be

---------05:44----------
stored by the capacitor and when this

---------05:45----------
decides that it's going in short to

---------05:47----------
ground again when this trip decides this

---------05:48----------
short the voltage in front of the coil

---------05:49----------
ground it's not going to make the

---------05:51----------
voltage that's inside of the capacitors

---------05:53----------
go away because it cannot go back

---------05:55----------
through the diode it can only go one way

---------05:57----------
to the right not to the last year so one

---------05:59----------
of the first things that we have to

---------06:00----------
check for here is that we get 5 volts on

---------06:03----------
this part of the coil on around L 77 20

---------06:08----------
so I'm gonna turn this thing on hit the

---------06:12----------
keys on the screen we're going to look

---------06:13----------
over here and let's take a look so R

---------06:21----------
where it was where's my coil L 77 20

---------06:25----------
that's gonna be this so we get four

---------06:27----------
point nine volts but it's kind of going

---------06:29----------
down you see that not sure what's up

---------06:31----------
with that so we get voltage on the coil

---------06:34----------
but it's there and then it's but it's

---------06:36----------
kind of there but

---------06:38----------
really there leaky cap okay if it could

---------06:46----------
be a leaky cap what would we get if it

---------06:47----------
was a leaky cap

---------06:57----------
how will we check for that break in the

---------07:02----------
lines of the backlight LEDs well the

---------07:05----------
thing is we're not at the backlight LEDs

---------07:07----------
because at pin 1 we only have 4 point 8

---------07:10----------
volts so there's only a couple of

---------07:11----------
options here what are the two things

---------07:12----------
that would reduce our voltage at pin 1

---------07:16----------
no keyboard backlight please tell me

---------07:19----------
someone isn't paying for 25 for this

---------07:20----------
miles miles got to make up for all those

---------07:25----------
SMC's and dead PCHS and CPU somehow now

---------07:28----------
man all right what do we do what do we

---------07:31----------
do our 7 7 8 3 all right let's check our

---------07:34----------
7 7 8 3 so that's gonna be over here

---------07:36----------
that's gonna sit between pp5 VSO and the

---------07:40----------
keyboard backlight so this is a zero ohm

---------07:42----------
resistor which is being used in this

---------07:44----------
case as a fuse so let's see on this side

---------07:51----------
five point zero four seven and on this

---------07:55----------
side four point nine four point eight

---------07:58----------
four point seven someone says remove

---------08:00----------
JTAG no all right so let's check -

---------08:04----------
somebody said check for a short all

---------08:06----------
right so we're gonna turn the Machine

---------08:07----------
off because we don't want to have power

---------08:08----------
applied while we do this put the meter

---------08:11----------
in diode mode in check on let's see pp

---------08:15----------
five ESO can't be shorted because it's

---------08:17----------
turning on obviously Miele says just run

---------08:25----------
PP five ESO to the keyboard

---------08:26----------
no one adjusted anyways and if they

---------08:28----------
[ __ ] just Dremel a switch on the side

---------08:30----------
of the computer someone's I think

---------08:32----------
getting a little jealous at me making

---------08:34----------
money off of this that sounds like

---------08:36----------
someone's trying to sabotage me so

---------08:38----------
there's no short and if on either side

---------08:41----------
and if we check the resistance of the

---------08:44----------
resistor let's see what we get here but

---------08:50----------
you get some millions of ohms man miles

---------08:54----------
is gonna be mad if he saw how much I was

---------08:56----------
getting paid to replace a resistor today

---------08:57----------
so it looks like we're gonna be

---------08:59----------
replacing a resistor all right so we're

---------09:01----------
going to take this resistor and

---------09:09----------
this resistor is not resisting anymore

---------09:12----------
it's resisting a little too much

---------09:14----------
actually we need to replace with

---------09:15----------
something that resists a lot less

---------09:18----------
because this is resisting way too much

---------09:21----------
which means it's not gonna be welcome

---------09:23----------
here we're gonna repeal and replace this

---------09:30----------
resistor with one that resists less

---------09:38----------
that's what we're gonna do

---------09:46----------
the PCB got scratched while he was

---------09:48----------
testing that resistor unprofessional no

---------09:51----------
that's not unprofessional dip Paul

---------09:52----------
that's not unprofessional this is

---------09:55----------
unprofessional this is unprofessional

---------10:35----------
I warranty all right so let's get the

---------10:38----------
resistor replaced I should start drawing

---------10:43----------
trees on the motherboards that would be

---------10:45----------
that would be a really interesting

---------10:45----------
warranty sticker I keep getting these

---------10:48----------
comments on Bob Ross on the YouTube

---------10:51----------
channel and I think that would be a fun

---------10:56----------
way to make a warranty sticker

---------11:19----------
but-- but-- hey i has backlights on my

---------11:32----------
keys look at that look at that miles

---------11:37----------
that is beautiful so that's that's a fix

---------11:49----------
that's a fix
