---------00:00----------
all right let's go through another board

---------00:01----------
that's not turning on this is an eight

---------00:02----------
to zero for nine to four with some

---------00:05----------
liquid damage on it so let's just take a

---------00:06----------
look at what it looks like

---------00:08----------
so only put it under the microscope

---------00:09----------
you'll see that it's pretty general it's

---------00:11----------
kind of a little spit spread out

---------00:14----------
everywhere you have these stains excuse

---------00:17----------
me you have these stains on it over here

---------00:22----------
especially on them especially right on

---------00:26----------
the edge of the board this thing there's

---------00:32----------
no particular area that's really

---------00:34----------
disgusting there's just a little bit of

---------00:36----------
disgusting a little bit of everywhere

---------00:41----------
you do have some things that look Blair

---------00:46----------
but for the most part nothing here

---------00:49----------
really strikes me just the one thing

---------00:54----------
that here we yeah that that's gross this

---------00:59----------
area is like that on all of these boards

---------01:02----------
the u-19 50 area so we can take a look

---------01:05----------
at this touch that area up a little bit

---------01:07----------
and see if it does anything so that

---------01:11----------
capacitor is gross now this is going to

---------01:15----------
affect whether or not we go into an Esso

---------01:17----------
state so this is important

---------01:29----------
and as as usual because it's important

---------01:31----------
it's missing from my don't

---------01:38----------
okay next donor missing from you

---------01:44----------
hey really we can nothing be simple

---------01:59----------
nothing is simple is he

---------02:08----------
alright I'll find it after I'm done

---------02:11----------
removing these

---------02:23----------
yep same old same old

---------02:26----------
but first time I went over this issue

---------02:29----------
was around June of last year on a board

---------02:32----------
that was fixed for sunny an 8 to 0 34 76

---------02:37----------
so what I'm gonna do here is I'm just

---------02:39----------
going to scrape away at that until it

---------02:41----------
reappears

---------03:00----------
there's not really much to have reappear

---------03:02----------
there so I'm gonna have to draw a wire

---------03:05----------
that's fine I'll draw a wire to extend

---------03:13----------
it

---------03:41----------
tweezers would help here

---------04:09----------
it's got to make it the right length

---------04:15----------
all right that's a happy little wire

---------04:17----------
there so now I just got to find myself a

---------04:22----------
logic gate not a logic gate that's a

---------04:26----------
dual logic gate

---------04:42----------
found one yay all right so we're gonna

---------04:50----------
remove it off of my donor board

---------05:10----------
place it right over here

---------05:50----------
okay now I'm just gonna place a

---------05:52----------
capacitor there his soldering setup

---------05:59----------
always falls down because my desk is

---------06:01----------
really tiny because my office is really

---------06:04----------
tiny you know one thing I was looking at

---------06:06----------
yesterday we're just thinking to myself

---------06:08----------
if ice and again I don't plan I still be

---------06:11----------
in this business in 2023 god help me if

---------06:14----------
I'm still doing this in 2023 but if I'm

---------06:17----------
still here when my lease is up I was

---------06:21----------
thinking about this you know what would

---------06:23----------
I do where would I go and I was looking

---------06:25----------
and there were so many spaces I'm not

---------06:27----------
kidding they cost as much as the store

---------06:29----------
costs and they're in their offices and

---------06:31----------
not only are they offices rather than

---------06:33----------
stores at the same cost as the Ezzat

---------06:34----------
store but they're also crappiest so for

---------06:37----------
all the complaining I do about the

---------06:38----------
office I really shouldn't know getting

---------06:41----------
for the amount of money I'm paying for

---------06:42----------
this entire store I could get an office

---------06:45----------
that's smaller than the store on like

---------06:47----------
the seventh floor of a building on a

---------06:48----------
floor that I share with people and this

---------06:50----------
is the story you know I don't share it

---------06:51----------
walk into this store and it's all mine

---------06:55----------
yeah I have no idea what I would do in

---------06:57----------
2023

---------06:58----------
I was still in this business I mean I

---------07:00----------
would definitely wouldn't have a store

---------07:02----------
anymore I can tell you that much I would

---------07:03----------
have an office but I was thinking okay

---------07:08----------
if I spent the same amount of money that

---------07:09----------
I spend on a store right now in an

---------07:11----------
office could I get a larger office or a

---------07:13----------
nicer office the answer is no I'd

---------07:15----------
actually have a downgrade and I would

---------07:17----------
have a smaller space than I do now

---------07:18----------
it would be crappier than what I have

---------07:21----------
now

---------07:27----------
and that just kind of made me a little

---------07:29----------
sad what was it was a little sad because

---------07:32----------
again I guess the work that I've done up

---------07:34----------
until this point is not enough work to

---------07:36----------
support having you know some type of

---------07:38----------
nice sexy office somewhere I don't know

---------07:41----------
why that bothered me because I don't

---------07:42----------
really care about having a nice sexy

---------07:44----------
office think it's not even something

---------07:45----------
that I that I would want if it was

---------07:47----------
available to me and I had the money for

---------07:49----------
it I would still get the cheaper

---------07:50----------
shittier office so that I could have the

---------07:51----------
other money my bank account or for a

---------07:53----------
nice set of speakers was something I

---------07:55----------
don't know it is something that was in

---------07:57----------
passing

---------07:58----------
maybe my midlife crisis or something who

---------08:00----------
knows so what I'm gonna do now to see if

---------08:02----------
this thing is turning on and then plug

---------08:05----------
it in and let's see so the first test I

---------08:09----------
do is measure CPU V core that because

---------08:12----------
remember this model doesn't spin the fan

---------08:13----------
when it turns on okay I just said this

---------08:18----------
model doesn't spend the fan when it

---------08:19----------
turns on and the fan is spinning well it

---------08:26----------
usually doesn't unless it's trying to

---------08:28----------
make me look like an idiot so anyway

---------08:31----------
let's just go over in the schematic what

---------08:33----------
was going on with this board why I was

---------08:35----------
dead and what we did to fix it because

---------08:37----------
all I really did is I just I moved

---------08:39----------
around the board a little bit and then I

---------08:41----------
showed you something to look nasty but I

---------08:43----------
didn't really show you what that is for

---------08:44----------
or why it matters so let's get into that

---------08:48----------
on screen so okay I got my I got a

---------08:53----------
second open broadcaster monitor again oh

---------08:55----------
it was like 90 bucks it was a couple of

---------08:59----------
days of YouTube revenue no big no biggie

---------09:01----------
I like having a second monitor it was

---------09:03----------
worth it cuz I mean I'm cheap with a lot

---------09:05----------
of stuff but not being able to see what

---------09:07----------
you guys are seeing or having it

---------09:08----------
constantly switch to open broadcaster to

---------09:10----------
see what you guys were seeing that was a

---------09:11----------
real pain in the ass you know we could

---------09:13----------
literally ruin a whole video if I do the

---------09:15----------
video in the wrong mode so if I have the

---------09:16----------
camera on and not the microscope camera

---------09:18----------
and I don't know that you don't see it

---------09:19----------
that okay is it you here we go so this I

---------09:24----------
see this is a logic gate this is a

---------09:26----------
combination of two logic gates right so

---------09:28----------
we so you know when we talk about the

---------09:30----------
one of the logic gate for the one wire

---------09:32----------
circuit let's just open up an old

---------09:34----------
schematic that has that because this is

---------09:37----------
a circuit that you guys are all familiar

---------09:38----------
by now if you have a and B and it's

---------09:42----------
being powered by three point 42 volts

---------09:44----------
you get wise so if you have a and B and

---------09:47----------
this thing is getting voltage it needs

---------09:49----------
to turn on it will shoot out power on

---------09:51----------
why this is kind of like a dual version

---------09:53----------
of the same thing so it's one chip you

---------09:54----------
1950 but it has a B and then Y and then

---------09:58----------
a B and then Y and as you can see Apple

---------10:00----------
designers were a little confused this is

---------10:01----------
know stuff WTF or W my brain reads that

---------10:04----------
is WTF you know it says W F know stuff

---------10:07----------
do we need this and they they're not

---------10:10----------
really sure so as you can see here you

---------10:13----------
have all system power good on the left

---------10:15----------
if all system power good in CPU VR P

---------10:18----------
good are present you get PM SOP good and

---------10:22----------
god help Jason if he keeps not turning

---------10:25----------
the air filter off before he leaves and

---------10:27----------
then if you have those you get PM SOP

---------10:30----------
good now if you have PM SOP good as well

---------10:33----------
as SMC delayed power good if you have

---------10:35----------
those then you get this power okay which

---------10:37----------
then becomes PM PCH this power okay PM

---------10:41----------
PCH says power okay is going to go what

---------10:46----------
was that it goes to the SMC I believe

---------10:51----------
yeah that's the SMC but then it also

---------10:53----------
goes over to the PCH and this is system

---------10:57----------
power management this is the PCH chip

---------10:59----------
pad which is platform controller hub

---------11:01----------
it's very very similar to what the North

---------11:04----------
Bridge and the South Bridge do the PCH

---------11:06----------
is kind of like a North Bridge a South

---------11:08----------
Bridge and all in one and it also deals

---------11:11----------
with the Intel integrated video on the

---------11:13----------
CPU so what this does is if you have the

---------11:16----------
signals present on the Left it will give

---------11:17----------
you the signals present on the right so

---------11:19----------
once you get these signals present on

---------11:20----------
the Left then you'll get all the stuff

---------11:22----------
on the right so this is just one of the

---------11:24----------
system power ok signals that's required

---------11:26----------
and if you go back over here it'll give

---------11:28----------
you a little an idea of what you need so

---------11:29----------
you need to be in an Esso state

---------11:31----------
obviously if you're not getting to an

---------11:33----------
Esso state for at least a quarter of a

---------11:34----------
second you're not gonna have PP 3 B 3 SL

---------11:36----------
you're not have this you have the CPU

---------11:39----------
has to be ready and if all of that is

---------11:41----------
good then p.m. PCH cyst our okay comes

---------11:44----------
on and what was burned over here was the

---------11:49----------
PP 3 V 4 to underscore g3 hot leg

---------11:52----------
as always along with this capacitor

---------11:54----------
these machines always corrode in the

---------11:57----------
exact same spot every single time for

---------11:59----------
some reason that's just what it is it's

---------12:01----------
very predictable do let me know what you

---------12:02----------
think of the camera angle I'm not a big

---------12:04----------
fan in the beginning I was a fan of the

---------12:05----------
camera being up there it keeps tilting

---------12:07----------
it's a weird camera angle the one thing

---------12:09----------
I do like about the camera being up

---------12:10----------
there is if I want to film something

---------12:11----------
Jason's doing it's easy to just turn it

---------12:13----------
around and it also keeps the camera out

---------12:15----------
of the way of of my desk which as is has

---------12:18----------
no space and I like the fact that it

---------12:20----------
actually gives me an angle with the

---------12:21----------
multimeter it was really helpful in that

---------12:22----------
earlier backlight video I did being able

---------12:24----------
to show you the multimeter so just

---------12:27----------
always be on the lookout for liquid

---------12:29----------
damage look really close again the

---------12:30----------
corrode in the same spot it's just it's

---------12:33----------
consistent and the thing that I keep

---------12:35----------
telling people look before you

---------12:37----------
ultrasonic because that's gonna get

---------12:39----------
washed away by the ultrasonic and once

---------12:40----------
you ultrasonic it away and once that

---------12:42----------
little little bit of green a little bit

---------12:44----------
of Burnt is ultrasonic dawei it's gonna

---------12:45----------
be ten times harder for you to actually

---------12:47----------
find that after the fact that's why I

---------12:49----------
work on the board when I'm done working

---------12:52----------
on the board i ultrasonic it when I'm

---------12:53----------
done if I'm really getting confused or

---------12:55----------
screwed with if something is going on

---------12:57----------
that just seems really and out of the

---------12:59----------
ordinary kinky then I throw it in the

---------13:02----------
ultrasonic cleaner and we'll see if it

---------13:04----------
fixes it but I keep I keep track in my

---------13:06----------
head of what looked corroded just so

---------13:09----------
that when I put it on the cleaner all my

---------13:11----------
hints aren't gone so that's it for today

---------13:13----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------13:15----------
something
