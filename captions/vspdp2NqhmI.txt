---------00:00----------
Paul will get his iPhone for when he

---------00:01----------
comes back when I came to work today

---------00:02----------
apparently he went to some Rangers game

---------00:04----------
or something

---------00:05----------
so someone noticed I got a haircut

---------00:11----------
I have helmet hair can you tell I have

---------00:14----------
helmet hair you know why I have helmet

---------00:16----------
there though that's right

---------00:20----------
I love my birthing 60 amps with a

---------00:24----------
battery that can actually output up to

---------00:25----------
90 that's awesome

---------00:28----------
alright so today we're gonna be going

---------00:30----------
over the MacBook a 17:07 board that does

---------00:34----------
not turn on let's try and see if we can

---------00:36----------
figure out what's wrong with this

---------00:37----------
MacBook so this looks like an eight two

---------00:39----------
zero zero zero two eight one board and

---------00:43----------
the first thing we're gonna do is see if

---------00:45----------
we get five volts we're 20 volts on the

---------00:48----------
charger so I have this little USB C amp

---------00:51----------
meter here and after three seconds it's

---------00:57----------
stuck at 5.20 two volts you can usually

---------00:59----------
tell if it's gonna be at five or 20

---------01:01----------
because when it stuck at five volts it

---------01:02----------
usually uses ten mill amps and when it

---------01:04----------
go it's about to go to 20 volts you'll

---------01:06----------
see it's using a hundred to three

---------01:09----------
hundred milliamps so let's try and

---------01:11----------
figure out why this is now these are the

---------01:14----------
chips over here that talk to the USBC

---------01:17----------
charger here here here and here

---------01:22----------
and those chips are the CD 32 15 s

---------01:25----------
available on store dot Rossman group.com

---------01:28----------
don't delay buy today get the c zero

---------01:30----------
zero version rather than the bo3 so it

---------01:31----------
actually charges that chip needs PP 3v3

---------01:35----------
underscore g3 hot to work so first thing

---------01:37----------
we're gonna do is we're gonna check this

---------01:38----------
rail which is pp 3 v3 underscore g3 hot

---------01:41----------
and open up a schematic and board view

---------01:42----------
so that you can check it out now just

---------01:44----------
like you needed PP 3 v 4 to on the older

---------01:47----------
MacBooks to get a green light on this

---------01:49----------
one you need PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot

---------01:51----------
to get 20 volts in the charger so it's

---------01:53----------
essentially the same general idea as the

---------01:55----------
old boards where there's this is the

---------01:57----------
power rail that has to show up before

---------01:58----------
you get all the others so I'm gonna get

---------02:00----------
this schematic and board view on the

---------02:02----------
screen

---------02:06----------
so first thing we're gonna do is we're

---------02:08----------
gonna take a look at the PP through

---------02:09----------
three underscore g3 hot area

---------02:11----------
so this is where Pippa through p3

---------02:12----------
underscore jihad is going to be created

---------02:14----------
now the first thing I'm interested in

---------02:16----------
before I blame the chip or anything once

---------02:18----------
it actually see if it's creating Pippa

---------02:19----------
through v3 underscore g3 odds we're

---------02:21----------
gonna look on L eighteen sixty nine

---------02:25----------
hundred over there and see what we're

---------02:27----------
getting

---------02:49----------
as you can see we're getting zero volts

---------02:51----------
and Pepa 3v3 undersquare g3 yacht

---------02:53----------
so now we want to see why pepper three

---------02:54----------
to three underscore g3 hot is missing

---------02:56----------
which means we're going to go to u6 t

---------02:58----------
903 and zoomin now which one of the pins

---------03:01----------
on here do you think is gonna be

---------03:02----------
responsible for turning the chip on like

---------03:05----------
which pin do I have to send voltage on

---------03:06----------
it to for this to turn on there's gonna

---------03:10----------
be two pins now the first is going to be

---------03:12----------
here sup sup stands for supply and if

---------03:15----------
you don't know what it's stood for you

---------03:16----------
can kind of guess a little bit but it's

---------03:18----------
kind of like a combination of playing

---------03:19----------
wheel of fortune and also playing also

---------03:22----------
looking at what's here it says from USB

---------03:25----------
C source so this is the charging voltage

---------03:27----------
going into the chips this is charger

---------03:30----------
voltage it says from so it's obvious to

---------03:32----------
me that this is going to be input and it

---------03:34----------
says sup which is gonna stand for supply

---------03:36----------
and then you have another pin over here

---------03:39----------
says en en is going to be for enable and

---------03:44----------
if you weren't sure what those things

---------03:45----------
were you can always simply Google max

---------03:47----------
seven seven five nine six you'll find a

---------03:50----------
datasheet for it

---------03:51----------
this company is has not gone full Apple

---------03:53----------
yet in terms of hiding data sheets for

---------03:55----------
every single one of their chips like

---------03:56----------
Intersil did so you know they didn't

---------04:00----------
cook to Apple and hiding all their data

---------04:02----------
sheets from everybody but they will

---------04:03----------
likely soon as soon as I say that so we

---------04:06----------
need this enable signal to be present so

---------04:08----------
let's just see if our enable signal is

---------04:09----------
actually present that's going to be on

---------04:11----------
pin 10 of the chip and that's small

---------04:13----------
enough that I'm likely gonna need a

---------04:14----------
microscope to get in there so pin 10 is

---------04:16----------
gonna be right down here we are gonna

---------04:18----------
get my microscope focused

---------04:24----------
in that area go go gadget microscope go

---------04:31----------
go

---------04:37----------
and let's see what we get on pin 10

---------04:42----------
let's also see if spectrum can manage to

---------04:45----------
actually allow me to stream at 1/3 of

---------04:48----------
the bandwidth that I pay for for more

---------04:51----------
than five minutes you may have noticed

---------04:52----------
they haven't been uploading lately

---------04:53----------
that's because at the store I have no

---------04:55----------
internet

---------04:56----------
do I pay 400 nine dollars a month for

---------04:59----------
that Internet absolutely and I paid for

---------05:01----------
that Internet for them near seven years

---------05:04----------
yes

---------05:05----------
has it been absolute trash with past 7

---------05:07----------
years every single day whether it's Time

---------05:09----------
Warner or the red spectrum some things

---------05:11----------
never change their trash ok zero volts

---------05:18----------
on enable which means that the chip is

---------05:19----------
not being asked to turn on so I can't

---------05:21----------
blame the chip I can't blame a

---------05:22----------
short-circuit after if it's not even

---------05:24----------
being asked to turn on I can't blame a

---------05:25----------
chip it's not you know you can't blame

---------05:27----------
somebody for not doing their job if they

---------05:29----------
never we're at we're told what their job

---------05:31----------
was or what it is they're supposed to do

---------05:33----------
or that they're supposed to show up so

---------05:34----------
we're gonna look for where that enable

---------05:35----------
signal comes from and go from there so

---------05:37----------
if I look over here the first thing I'm

---------05:39----------
gonna do is try to figure out where this

---------05:41----------
comes from

---------05:41----------
so this is gonna cop p.m. en p3 v3

---------05:44----------
underscore g3 hot now usually I would

---------05:47----------
check the zero ohm resistor over here

---------05:48----------
our 69 21 to see if that resistor is bad

---------05:51----------
but for my experience it never ever ever

---------05:52----------
ever ever ever goes bad so I'm just kind

---------05:54----------
of jumping over that because I kind of

---------05:56----------
want to finish up my work quick today so

---------05:57----------
I can get a burrito

---------05:58----------
so that signal is going to come from

---------06:01----------
this trip over here you 7000 which is

---------06:03----------
the is l9 239 this chip is very similar

---------06:06----------
to the ISL 65:9 in fact it's so similar

---------06:08----------
to the ISL 6259 that in Apple's own

---------06:11----------
schematic they labeled at the is l6 two

---------06:13----------
five nine great [ __ ] engineering great

---------06:16----------
job schematic team telling us that we

---------06:19----------
are not qualified to work on your

---------06:20----------
product when you can't even get the

---------06:21----------
names of the chip right what look at Lee

---------06:23----------
this is l6 259 use 7000 I click it again

---------06:28----------
and it's an ISO nine two three nine is

---------06:34----------
it an ISL nine two six nine or an iso

---------06:37----------
nine two three nine I don't know are we

---------06:40----------
supposed to put more cooling in the

---------06:41----------
iodine MacBook so it doesn't throttle I

---------06:43----------
don't know

---------06:44----------
just an Apple engineer how can I be

---------06:47----------
expected to be useful anyway back to

---------06:50----------
this so this is the is l9 2 3 9 chip and

---------06:52----------
we can find it right over here and this

---------06:55----------
is gonna be the end of the line for that

---------06:57----------
signal that's probably gonna be the

---------06:58----------
cause of my problem so let's just check

---------07:00----------
it out yep that's my good old eye a

---------07:02----------
saddle 9 2 3 9 or is L 6 2 5 9 depending

---------07:07----------
on whether you're not you're the stoned

---------07:09----------
Apple engineer that wrote that schematic

---------07:10----------
and then by the way everybody if you

---------07:12----------
need a nice aisle 93 9 you're not sure

---------07:14----------
where to find it cuz Apple won't tell

---------07:15----------
you if you want to know where to find it

---------07:17----------
and Intersil won't let you get don't

---------07:19----------
worry about it cuz we got you covered

---------07:20----------
you've just get over here to store it

---------07:21----------
out Rostelecom and buy an is l9 239

---------07:26----------
which is actually in stock it says out

---------07:28----------
of stock for some strange reason even

---------07:30----------
though it's in stock because Nike didn't

---------07:33----------
update the inventor mikey mikey is l9

---------07:40----------
two three nine says out of stock but we

---------07:42----------
have over 15 of them let's get a show up

---------07:49----------
is in stock very soon thank you very

---------07:51----------
much Danny Garcia

---------07:52----------
so that chips gonna be showing up in

---------07:53----------
stock soon either that or there's gonna

---------07:55----------
be another employee that's stuck in the

---------07:56----------
basement we're gonna turn this place

---------08:00----------
into C sad solutions so fast his head's

---------08:04----------
gonna spin right off by the way we're

---------08:08----------
still looking for employees so if you

---------08:09----------
want a job try an email help at rossmann

---------08:12----------
group comm you have excellent benefits

---------08:13----------
acts lovely working conditions for

---------08:15----------
anybody who can count the inventory so

---------08:16----------
that being said let's move on to

---------08:19----------
replacing this chip

---------08:23----------
okay so first thing I'm gonna do is take

---------08:26----------
a hot every workstation is l9 239 it

---------08:29----------
says out of stock it says out of stock

---------08:41----------
says it in the URL x5 inventory alright

---------08:53----------
so

---------09:05----------
okay I'm gonna use my hot air I believe

---------09:08----------
I have a six point five millimeter

---------09:10----------
nozzle here thank you for the burrito

---------09:13----------
and thank you Malta

---------09:15----------
mcnutty I appreciate that it's very kind

---------09:32----------
to Goodson spectrum hates PP bus

---------09:35----------
apparently they do apparently they do

---------09:40----------
they're not very nice people their

---------09:42----------
inspection they don't care if you have

---------09:44----------
internet or not late as kids they get

---------09:46----------
their four hundred nine dollars plus tax

---------09:47----------
a month

---------09:55----------
I really do want to try to beam the

---------09:57----------
files that I get at home here cuz all I

---------09:59----------
can get here is da Verizon DSL which is

---------10:02----------
actually down more often than the my DSL

---------10:05----------
is down more often than the DEM cable is

---------10:08----------
because I actually got this pfSense

---------10:10----------
router that does load balancing so what

---------10:13----------
what I do is I have a router that when

---------10:15----------
Time Warner goes down or spectrum goes

---------10:17----------
down it automatically switches over to

---------10:19----------
the Verizon DSL without you noticing

---------10:20----------
it's supposed to be you know instant

---------10:22----------
kind of thing but the reality is that I

---------10:24----------
actually have more downtime with Verizon

---------10:26----------
DSL than I do with the Time Warner

---------10:27----------
making it completely useless as a

---------10:29----------
redundant connection New York City

---------10:31----------
Internet well I yelled at Mikey to do it

---------10:38----------
that means that it was your fault all

---------10:40----------
along it was you are you pocketing chips

---------10:48----------
empty your pockets take off your shoes

---------10:51----------
dump kick

---------10:55----------
can't trust Kevin

---------11:18----------
what is that green stuff on the end of

---------11:19----------
my flux much gross yeah we're gonna suck

---------11:24----------
up all those balls because there's

---------11:25----------
nothing I enjoy doing more on stream

---------11:27----------
than sucking up a bunch of balls alright

---------11:34----------
I suck up all those balls mmm

---------11:39----------
I love sucking up balls especially on

---------11:42----------
livestream

---------11:45----------
remove those two capacitors over that I

---------11:49----------
wrecked with while I was busy sucking up

---------11:52----------
the balls

---------12:02----------
and we're gonna run yourselves for a new

---------12:05----------
ISL ship mmm

---------12:08----------
beautiful let's see if I was right and

---------12:12----------
if the problem is the ISL oh along by

---------12:16----------
the way this is this chip is such a

---------12:17----------
[ __ ] that the board can have zero

---------12:19----------
corrosion and this can happen it just

---------12:21----------
dies like poof out of thin air just poof

---------12:47----------
I really like to beam files from my home

---------12:50----------
to the store that would be lovely

---------12:51----------
it's only about five miles away I have a

---------12:55----------
really tall building I'm gonna beam the

---------12:59----------
files from my apartment here this you

---------13:00----------
watch we watch Time Warner fastest

---------13:08----------
yeah see how that ship just fell now I'm

---------13:11----------
gonna Hennis y'all this back and forth

---------13:13----------
to make that should dance in a place

---------13:15----------
dance chick dance yes yep

---------13:20----------
thanks for the free lesson that

---------13:21----------
successfully fist my own Mac never

---------13:23----------
thought I'd carry out uh Cindy work

---------13:24----------
well congratulations I'm glad you

---------13:26----------
figured something out must feel good to

---------13:28----------
get that nice dopamine rush at the end

---------13:29----------
when something actually works speaking

---------13:31----------
of something actually working let's cool

---------13:33----------
this thing off for a moment and see if I

---------13:36----------
get 20 volts in my charger if I do and

---------13:40----------
that's another machine out of the queue

---------13:59----------
[Music]

---------14:02----------
mm-hmm

---------14:06----------
okay so what are we trust more is all 93

---------14:08----------
nine from Apple or ISO 93 9 from store

---------14:11----------
cross new group comm one way to find out

---------14:14----------
my friends one way to find out zoom in

---------14:18----------
with that crappy Sony stock lens from my

---------14:21----------
Chico camera plug this thing in and see

---------14:24----------
what we get

---------14:25----------
Oh check that out

---------14:29----------
Rhett 20 point three volts and one point

---------14:31----------
four amps now this is my equivalent on

---------14:35----------
the new MacBooks of fan spin and it's

---------14:38----------
gonna turn off and turn on again because

---------14:40----------
it's complaining that it doesn't have a

---------14:41----------
battery attached sometimes they do that

---------14:44----------
when they come back from the dead but as

---------14:45----------
can be seen this is turning on and

---------14:47----------
working meaning our fix worked and that

---------14:50----------
our chip from stored out Rossmann group

---------14:52----------
comm save the day so that's it for today

---------14:55----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------14:56----------
something

---------15:04----------
[Music]

---------15:12----------
I didn't hit record

---------15:16----------
so now I can't upload that as a main

---------15:18----------
Channel video oh that makes me sad much

---------15:26----------
sad

---------15:35----------
oh wow

---------15:38----------
time for a burrito so dad I'll speak to

---------15:41----------
you see you all later
