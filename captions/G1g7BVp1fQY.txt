---------00:00----------
hi so today I'm gonna be going over a

---------00:01----------
couple of boards that are dead so this

---------00:03----------
is a MacBook Air eight to zero 34:37

---------00:06----------
motherboard that was sent in with the

---------00:08----------
problem that it is dead it has no power

---------00:10----------
now when I plugged the DCN board him I

---------00:12----------
get a orange light on the charger and

---------00:15----------
that orange light in the charger means

---------00:16----------
that the 3pp 3v4 to power rail is

---------00:20----------
working as I've mentioned in other

---------00:21----------
videos the one wire circuit is powered

---------00:22----------
off of that power rail so what I want to

---------00:25----------
know now is why is this not turning on

---------00:26----------
so all the core i5 and core i7 series

---------00:29----------
MacBooks anybody who is plugged in more

---------00:31----------
than two or three these knows that all

---------00:32----------
the core i5 and i7 series besides on

---------00:35----------
occasion the 2010 8 1286 well just turn

---------00:37----------
itself on automatically so if it doesn't

---------00:39----------
turn itself on automatically if it

---------00:41----------
doesn't enter that Esso state

---------00:42----------
automatically you can assume that

---------00:44----------
something is wrong this was sent in by

---------00:46----------
some people that really don't have much

---------00:48----------
business touching or refurbishing

---------00:50----------
computers it's just kind of one of those

---------00:52----------
companies that has like a lot of

---------00:53----------
fancy-schmancy branding but that doesn't

---------00:55----------
know how to do anything and one of the

---------00:57----------
things that you'll see here is that I

---------00:58----------
mean like on half of the machines that

---------01:00----------
were sent all the little connectors were

---------01:02----------
just kind of ripped off so let me just

---------01:03----------
plug in the microscope here so that I

---------01:05----------
can show you what I'm talking about

---------01:07----------
under the microscope camera how people

---------01:09----------
like this get business is beyond me I

---------01:11----------
really think people just like they they

---------01:13----------
they will they prefer branding to

---------01:14----------
knowledge like it's not about branding

---------01:16----------
it's about you know the prettiness of

---------01:18----------
the website and a fancy lame and all

---------01:20----------
that other [ __ ] but that is the world

---------01:23----------
that we live in

---------01:24----------
so let's look over here yeah this is the

---------01:26----------
kind of [ __ ] I'm talking about like you

---------01:27----------
couldn't leave the the latch on even one

---------01:30----------
of these it would have just it would

---------01:31----------
have killed you to leave the latch on

---------01:32----------
one of these which is why that most of

---------01:34----------
these machines are going to the bottom

---------01:36----------
of the pile so when I get stuff that's

---------01:37----------
been pre [ __ ] with as usual bottom of

---------01:40----------
the pile why am I gonna reward people

---------01:42----------
that destroyed resada miters or

---------01:44----------
skull-fuck something before sending it

---------01:46----------
here you know I kind of want to reward

---------01:48----------
the people that said you know what I

---------01:49----------
shouldn't touch this because I have no

---------01:51----------
idea what the [ __ ] I'm doing let me give

---------01:52----------
it to somebody else but I digress off

---------01:55----------
rant and on to measuring on to fixing

---------01:58----------
and we're gonna do that now so let's see

---------02:01----------
if this thing is and trying to enter an

---------02:03----------
Esso state that's the first thing so you

---------02:05----------
got s5 s3 and esos when you plug the

---------02:07----------
charger in its supposed to instantly

---------02:08----------
kind of try to go to an Esso state so

---------02:11----------
I'm gonna open the board view and

---------02:13----------
so the schematic for an eight to zero

---------02:15----------
3437 so that we can go through the power

---------02:17----------
rails and see what's what's present

---------02:19----------
what's missing and try to get an idea of

---------02:21----------
what it is that's going on oh another

---------02:23----------
thing this place does is they kind of

---------02:24----------
include little tidbits of like where

---------02:27----------
they think the damage is the rich with

---------02:30----------
the sticker

---------02:30----------
I am 99.9% certain that just because

---------02:34----------
they are the ones that put that sticker

---------02:35----------
there that they are [ __ ] wrong so I

---------02:38----------
am gonna be completely ignoring that I

---------02:40----------
am just pretending it's not there even

---------02:43----------
though there is actual board damage

---------02:45----------
under the sticker I just don't care I am

---------02:47----------
so confident I am so confident that has

---------02:49----------
nothing to do with the problem that I'm

---------02:52----------
just gonna totally [ __ ] ignore it all

---------02:53----------
right so let's go over to the page of

---------02:56----------
the schematic over here where you're

---------02:58----------
going to see a list of power rails I

---------03:00----------
believe they move that to page 63 or 67

---------03:03----------
that used to be on page one two or three

---------03:05----------
well I put the most important part of

---------03:07----------
the schematic in the beginning why not

---------03:08----------
put it all the way at the end so that

---------03:09----------
it's impossible to find why do we do

---------03:11----------
that because Apple hates you

---------03:13----------
that is exactly why so first things

---------03:15----------
first I know that I have P P 3 P 4 2

---------03:17----------
because the 1 wire circuit is working I

---------03:19----------
guess yeah like my charger so first

---------03:21----------
thing I'm gonna do right now let's check

---------03:23----------
for P P bus G 3 hot let's just see if

---------03:26----------
you can see my multimeter let's see if

---------03:29----------
that shows up an open broadcaster it

---------03:31----------
does it's not amazing but yeah you can

---------03:35----------
see it so let's see P P bus g3 hot is

---------03:40----------
giving me supposed to be 8 point

---------03:43----------
something 8.5 close enough alright next

---------03:47----------
on the list PP 5vs5 so when I go over to

---------03:50----------
the board view software just to give you

---------03:52----------
an idea of what here we go

---------03:55----------
board view software it looks like so ok

---------03:58----------
PP 5v underscore s5 let's see it shows

---------04:03----------
me on the board where it is I can flip

---------04:05----------
this make sure it still stays plugged in

---------04:09----------
okay PP 5vs5 this supposed to be over

---------04:12----------
here 5 volts beautiful so I switch back

---------04:20----------
over to the PDF reader I hate 1080 P I

---------04:22----------
miss my 4k TV this is not only is 1080p

---------04:25----------
suck but this is like a crappy

---------04:27----------
should 1080p monitor so it's like one of

---------04:30----------
those $100 one so it's a real piece of

---------04:32----------
[ __ ] I'm gonna skip PPV RTC g3 ha

---------04:35----------
because that probably comes from here

---------04:37----------
which works

---------04:38----------
let's see PP 5 vs 4 RS 3 are you present

---------04:42----------
let's see if you're on my motherboard

---------04:44----------
alright let's see at the time that's

---------04:52----------
gonna be over here glad so bottom the

---------04:57----------
left of the SPI ROM chip the big

---------05:00----------
capacitor over there I get 0 mofo

---------05:15----------
mofo I'm looking at the right place

---------05:20----------
right okay so that's missing now against

---------05:25----------
I don't know the best of memory I'm just

---------05:27----------
going to open a new notepad plus plus

---------05:28----------
file and make a note that that is

---------05:30----------
missing so this is missing

---------05:36----------
alrighty obviously PP 5 ESO is going to

---------05:42----------
be missing because PP 5 es 4 is not

---------05:43----------
present let's see if any other rails are

---------05:46----------
going this the system is probably not

---------05:48----------
even close to an Esso state oh let's see

---------05:51----------
pp 3 B 3 so

---------06:22----------
yeah not even close so we are not

---------06:24----------
getting to s oh okay now let's see let's

---------06:29----------
see if P P so P P 5 vs 4 underscore PP 5

---------06:34----------
V underscore s 4 RS 3 is not present

---------06:36----------
let's see if P P 3 V 3 S 4 is present so

---------06:38----------
is it 1s for real that's missing on all

---------06:40----------
as for rails that's missing if 1s for

---------06:43----------
rail is missing that may just mean that

---------06:45----------
my chip is bad or something that's

---------06:47----------
around there is bad risk every s for L

---------06:49----------
is missing that means that the signal is

---------06:51----------
just not going out to turn any of the S

---------06:53----------
4 rails on so let's see if P P 3 B 3 S 4

---------06:55----------
is there right so we go over here PP 3 B

---------06:59----------
3 S 4 Oh

---------07:01----------
1080p sucks [ __ ] and ball is it really

---------07:03----------
does I don't know why I'm bitching there

---------07:08----------
are people doing this

---------07:09----------
in other countries where there 1366 by

---------07:12----------
768 is like the best thing that ever

---------07:15----------
happened to them and I am bitching about

---------07:18----------
being stuck at 1080p alright so we are

---------07:22----------
missing P P 3 V 3 s 4 so pretty much

---------07:27----------
whatever enables all the S 4 rails is

---------07:29----------
[ __ ] so now we kind of go to start

---------07:32----------
exploring and let's let's see what areas

---------07:34----------
look kind of [ __ ] on this board and

---------07:36----------
we're gonna just go and click around and

---------07:38----------
see what's relevant and what's not

---------07:40----------
relevant so the first part that looks

---------07:42----------
fuked is this part under this red

---------07:44----------
sticker here so this is where they

---------07:45----------
they're trying to tell me what they

---------07:46----------
think is the problem so let's see what

---------07:49----------
that ship and I agree that does look

---------07:51----------
[ __ ] but again I I just I just I am

---------07:54----------
not offended the self estimate because

---------07:55----------
it is so often wrong and particularly

---------07:58----------
with this set of people but let's see

---------08:02----------
what does this chip and what the [ __ ]

---------08:04----------
does it do you are you 30 to 20 and I

---------08:09----------
have a feeling that you're for

---------08:10----------
DisplayPort or something that I don't

---------08:11----------
care about you 30 to 20 you 30 to 20 you

---------08:17----------
are for Thunderbolt I don't give a

---------08:23----------
flying [ __ ] about Thunder ball right now

---------08:26----------
Thunderbolt can bite my ass really I

---------08:29----------
mean that you don't turn on why the [ __ ]

---------08:31----------
would I care about Thunderbolt let's

---------08:33----------
just see if that chip is shorting PB 3v3

---------08:35----------
as

---------08:36----------
for the ground that's the only thing

---------08:38----------
that I care about right now are you

---------08:40----------
shorting pp 3 B 3 is for the ground so

---------08:43----------
let's go back and see where PPP V 3 S 4

---------08:45----------
is and let's just see if it's shorted to

---------08:50----------
ground I don't know yeah I care I don't

---------08:52----------
give a [ __ ] about thunderbolt on a

---------08:54----------
computer that doesn't turn on [ __ ]

---------08:56----------
Thunderbolt Thunder that is that can be

---------08:59----------
worried about at a later time you it

---------09:03----------
again I'm always talking about sequence

---------09:04----------
in order ok so dialed one measurement to

---------09:07----------
ground is 0.33 5 that is not a short a

---------09:09----------
short is when you tap the blue leads

---------09:11----------
together and you get 0 so when I put

---------09:14----------
these two leads together and it's a zero

---------09:16----------
that means that there's a zero voltage

---------09:17----------
drop across the points that's a short

---------09:19----------
when I put it there and I get point

---------09:20----------
three three five that is not a short so

---------09:23----------
what's telling the s4 rails to turn on

---------09:26----------
is not is not doing its job so let's

---------09:28----------
kind of try to find out what that is so

---------09:30----------
let's go back to the schematic and okay

---------09:33----------
so let's just go over to where PP 5vo

---------09:36----------
whatever s4 rs3 is created and let's see

---------09:40----------
what tells us to turn on shall we all

---------09:43----------
right so what makes this is it you yes

---------09:46----------
it's you here we go PP 5 es 4 RS 3 so

---------09:50----------
this is told to turn on by enable 1 P 5

---------09:55----------
vs 4 RS 3 n well what did I just do

---------09:58----------
there there we go so yeah so yeah P 5 vs

---------10:04----------
4 RS 3 enable R so this goes where do

---------10:08----------
you go alright 7 5 5 1 this turns to

---------10:11----------
this where do you come from and I always

---------10:13----------
say measure the front of the circuit in

---------10:14----------
the back of the circuit to save yourself

---------10:16----------
time so this goes out based on p.m.

---------10:20----------
sleep best for L is PM sleep best for L

---------10:24----------
present on my board let's see if p.m.

---------10:27----------
sleep s4 L is present on my board okay

---------10:34----------
where is an easy place to measure it no

---------10:37----------
I don't want to measure under the SMC

---------10:39----------
you know I don't want to measure on that

---------10:41----------
little tiny piece of crap I measure on

---------10:44----------
that resistor oh yeah I'll [ __ ] with

---------10:46----------
that resistor that looks like something

---------10:48----------
I can actually I have a chance

---------10:49----------
of touching okay so when I measure p.m.

---------10:55----------
sleep s4l on multimeter let's see what

---------10:59----------
it is I get so it's supposed to be right

---------11:04----------
here next to this can barely see it

---------11:07----------
tiny bullshit-ass resistor 0.197 and on

---------11:15----------
the other side I get 0.197 so that's the

---------11:22----------
thing that's what's interesting it's not

---------11:23----------
zero but it's not three it's like it's

---------11:26----------
trying to do something so on both sides

---------11:28----------
of that resistor I get [ __ ] so it's

---------11:30----------
trying to put something out but it's not

---------11:32----------
really doing what it's supposed to so

---------11:35----------
let's go down the line and kind of see

---------11:36----------
what else is going on with this board

---------11:37----------
with the other power else so we're gonna

---------11:39----------
go back to I think page 63 is what I

---------11:41----------
said has the power rails on it

---------11:42----------
Oh get over here okay oh I can't wait

---------11:49----------
for the rest of my staff to come back I

---------11:51----------
can't wait to be able to go to sleep

---------11:53----------
again go in asleep was so nice you

---------11:58----------
notice it when you don't get to go to

---------12:00----------
sleep anymore how much you missed it

---------12:01----------
when you you were able to also see PP 3

---------12:05----------
V 3 S 5 let's see if you are present pp

---------12:15----------
3 B 3 s 5 ok there's a lot of places to

---------12:21----------
measure that thank God

---------12:27----------
so what yeah Wow alright on that little

---------12:39----------
piece of [ __ ] up here we're supposed to

---------12:40----------
see something pp 3 B 3 s 5 is there and

---------12:47----------
P P 3 B 3 S 4 is not so we're just gonna

---------12:50----------
continue making the list of the power

---------12:52----------
rails that are missing

---------12:57----------
I know that the sl1 is missing if the

---------13:02----------
s41 is missing so no need to check that

---------13:04----------
okay let's see what PP 3v3 sauce is

---------13:07----------
talking about and also PP 3v3 a PP 3v3

---------13:11----------
underscore sus P P 3 P 3 yes alright so

---------13:19----------
over here that is it is gone hmm

---------13:27----------
and you power my BIOS chip that's no

---------13:32----------
good

---------13:33----------
I need PP 3 V 3 underscore sauce

---------13:36----------
so this is where sequence comes into

---------13:38----------
play this is what I'm always talking

---------13:39----------
about sequence and now it's more

---------13:41----------
important to understand sequence and now

---------13:43----------
the circuit actually works than it is to

---------13:44----------
just be guessing all the time so my ezza

---------13:47----------
so I'm missing p.m. underscore sleep

---------13:49----------
underscore s 4 underscore L right p.m.

---------13:51----------
sleep best for L that's a signal I need

---------13:54----------
for a lot of my ass for rails to turn on

---------13:55----------
right I'm missing this let's go over

---------13:58----------
here so you can see that now this signal

---------14:02----------
comes from the CPU or well it comes from

---------14:06----------
the PCH which on this board is inside

---------14:08----------
the CPU right so I'm missing p.m. sleep

---------14:10----------
as for L was I just talking about wow

---------14:19----------
I'm drawing a complete blank as to where

---------14:21----------
my train of thought was just there ah

---------14:23----------
there so anyway so the SPI ROM tells

---------14:26----------
this what to do so this is the SPI ROM

---------14:28----------
chip use 6100 or otherwise known as the

---------14:31----------
BIOS you know just because at BIOS is

---------14:33----------
easier to say than SPI ROM chip now this

---------14:36----------
tells that what to do so if I'm not

---------14:39----------
getting power on this chip because my pp

---------14:42----------
3v3 sauce is missing so let's see what

---------14:43----------
pen aid over here so VI let's see pin 8

---------14:46----------
is VDD critical I need this well the

---------14:52----------
critical is not on pin 8 that's just

---------14:53----------
critical as the chip I'm losing my mind

---------14:56----------
I need to go to sleep

---------14:57----------
v DD v N or VCC those pins are the pins

---------15:01----------
that you see when I forgot what I was

---------15:05----------
talking about again

---------15:09----------
what was I doing on this page what was I

---------15:13----------
looking at I wasn't looking at this not

---------15:15----------
looking at SPI bus termination okay here

---------15:18----------
we go

---------15:19----------
spi ROM VDD VCC or VN those are the pins

---------15:24----------
on the chip that are used to power it to

---------15:26----------
turn it on so like you know on a light

---------15:27----------
bulb you have the positive you apply

---------15:30----------
power to that end of the light bulb and

---------15:32----------
it turns on same thing here this chip

---------15:34----------
will not turn on if you don't have

---------15:35----------
supply power to that pin so the bios

---------15:37----------
chip the SPI ROM chip talks to the PCH

---------15:40----------
it's gonna tell the PCH to do things

---------15:42----------
like read these signals and then do this

---------15:44----------
and do that and turn on and all sorts of

---------15:46----------
stuff that again if you're a computer

---------15:47----------
engineer you're gonna understand a lot

---------15:48----------
better than I am but the BIOS chip is

---------15:51----------
required for the PCH to send any of

---------15:53----------
those signals if you take a perfectly

---------15:54----------
working board and you just take away

---------15:55----------
power to the BIOS chip you won't get any

---------15:57----------
of those signals out of the PCH you

---------15:58----------
won't get p.m. sleep s4l you won't get

---------16:00----------
PM sleep s3l in any of those so sequence

---------16:04----------
I'm not gonna focus on oh let me heat

---------16:07----------
gun my CPU oh let me destroy my CPU oh

---------16:10----------
let me send three volts to that PM sleep

---------16:13----------
s4l signal to see if that's gonna get

---------16:15----------
everything working because I don't have

---------16:17----------
a working BIOS chip again sequence so

---------16:19----------
let's check what PP 3 V 3 sus is talking

---------16:22----------
about again if you went down a rabbit

---------16:24----------
hole checking every single component on

---------16:26----------
them and figure out what I was talking

---------16:31----------
about again alright then I'm sure I'll

---------16:34----------
remember later so let's see what PPD v3

---------16:36----------
undersquare sauce comes from so PP 3 B 3

---------16:41----------
underscore sauce comes from not there

---------16:47----------
that's a pull up to create Rissa Marissa

---------16:49----------
Marissa Marissa

---------16:52----------
ok pp 3 V 3 sauce boy well yeah I'm

---------17:02----------
gonna solve this half asleep or not

---------17:09----------
here we go I think I passed it 3.3 volts

---------17:14----------
uh switch so PP 3 B 3 underscore well PA

---------17:19----------
mouthful

---------17:20----------
alright PP 3 B 3 s 5 is here right we

---------17:23----------
saw that we saw the PP 3 B 3 is 5 is

---------17:25----------
present now this trip when it gets P 3 V

---------17:28----------
3 sus and Nabal is going to let out pp 3

---------17:31----------
B 3 sus fad which after this resistor

---------17:34----------
which I guess is not here because it

---------17:36----------
says omit terms of the pp 3 B 3 sauce I

---------17:39----------
don't have to look up with this chip

---------17:40----------
does this is just common [ __ ] sense

---------17:42----------
it says sus which you have V in and V

---------17:45----------
out in an on pin so maybe just maybe if

---------17:49----------
you get if you have 3.3 volts on the in

---------17:52----------
and you have the on has voltage on it

---------17:55----------
then you'll have power on out so let's

---------17:57----------
see what you 80/20 looks like on this

---------17:59----------
board you 80/20 and let's see if that

---------18:02----------
looks good or far this is one of those

---------18:04----------
things where you can't see what it looks

---------18:05----------
like because it's covered and [ __ ]

---------18:08----------
under fill' you you [ __ ] pieces of

---------18:11----------
[ __ ] looks oh my God look at this

---------18:15----------
[ __ ] right

---------18:16----------
so what pisses me off about new Apple

---------18:18----------
products mainly what the [ __ ] is this

---------18:21----------
what what is the meaning and the purpose

---------18:24----------
of this [ __ ] like [ __ ] you there's

---------18:28----------
no measure there's no measuring anything

---------18:30----------
on that [ __ ] out of here and I'm not

---------18:33----------
wasting time we're moving under fill'

---------18:34----------
we're gonna try to find probe points to

---------18:36----------
that because I don't got time or sanity

---------18:40----------
or sleep to remove thunder fill okay so

---------18:48----------
TVs are available where do you show up

---------18:52----------
on him where is your probe point all

---------18:55----------
right so thank God right next to that

---------18:57----------
chip you're gonna see a resistor and

---------19:04----------
this so our 8190 what what are you for

---------19:08----------
are you 190 I will look for that later

---------19:13----------
let's see if we have this P 3 V 3 sus

---------19:16----------
and Nabal see what I'm talking about no

---------19:19----------
no no no yes

---------19:22----------
so this okay I just pointed at the

---------19:24----------
monitor with my hands thinking that you

---------19:26----------
would see that whoops this P 3 P 3 sus

---------19:28----------
enable I'm gonna measure and let's see

---------19:30----------
what we get over there so let's plug

---------19:31----------
this thing back in just try not to fall

---------19:34----------
asleep company that's charging twice is

---------19:39----------
what I do for board repair not doing any

---------19:41----------
of the work needs their board back and

---------19:44----------
figure this [ __ ] out okay we get nothing

---------19:51----------
and next to it at that probe point there

---------19:54----------
is no rights let's see where does p3 v3

---------20:00----------
sauce and Abel come from p3 v3 sauce and

---------20:04----------
navel let's see let's chase this down

---------20:06----------
let's chase this rabbit and kill it okay

---------20:11----------
you come from p.m. sleeps us L ok this

---------20:17----------
is becoming a quite the rabbit hole so

---------20:19----------
p.m. sleep sauce L is going to come from

---------20:25----------
the PCH Y which is not gonna be doing

---------20:33----------
much because of the lack of BIOS yay

---------20:36----------
okay this is where this becomes a

---------20:38----------
[ __ ] let's see yeah let's figure

---------20:42----------
this [ __ ] out right here so the other

---------20:54----------
side I get absolute [ __ ] so now we're

---------21:02----------
gonna just let's take a step back from

---------21:05----------
this because this is becoming a circular

---------21:07----------
loop so this the voltage that I need to

---------21:10----------
turn on the BIOS is missing the enable

---------21:12----------
to turn that on comes in the PCH PCH is

---------21:15----------
not gonna do much because the BIOS isn't

---------21:17----------
on the BIOS is along because P P 3 B 3

---------21:18----------
sus is missing sus is missing because

---------21:22----------
there's a missing enable signal the

---------21:24----------
enable signal comes from the PCH PCH

---------21:26----------
isn't turning on because the BIOS is not

---------21:28----------
powered BIOS is not powered because it's

---------21:30----------
missing 3.30 that

---------21:32----------
become known now step back step back new

---------21:38----------
approach now we go through and do that

---------21:42----------
whole physical inspection [ __ ] but

---------21:44----------
the thing with physical inspection now

---------21:46----------
that I've gone through the board and

---------21:47----------
I've gone through my problem I kinda

---------21:49----------
have I have context I kind of have an

---------21:52----------
idea of what it is I'm gonna be looking

---------21:54----------
for so when I see physical damage or a

---------21:56----------
nasty [ __ ] I'm going to have an idea of

---------21:58----------
what is relevant and what is just

---------22:00----------
[ __ ] for example the Thunderbolt

---------22:04----------
total [ __ ]

---------22:15----------
so I see some red stuff I'm gonna start

---------22:17----------
looking up what the red stuff is all

---------22:24----------
right so charger reset L is a little

---------22:26----------
nasty now I'm just kind of grasping at

---------22:30----------
straws but what the SMC reset L is

---------22:37----------
responsible for sending that charger

---------22:38----------
signal is SMC reset present because if

---------22:43----------
SMC reset isn't present then my ass MC

---------22:45----------
is not going to do the things that's

---------22:46----------
supposed to Oh like you'll get a light

---------22:51----------
but the S the SMC is not really gonna

---------22:53----------
work the way it's supposed to sometimes

---------22:56----------
you don't even get a light when SMC

---------22:57----------
reset is missing feel like I'm onto

---------22:59----------
something here all right so charger

---------23:01----------
reset L look nasty so I looked up that

---------23:03----------
probe point didn't look the way I wanted

---------23:06----------
it to so that's over here charger reset

---------23:09----------
L yeah so what I did is I looked that up

---------23:13----------
from the schematic and then that that

---------23:15----------
came from SMC recent L so let's look up

---------23:20----------
SMC reset L series come from all right I

---------23:30----------
moved the multimeter out of the way the

---------23:31----------
camera because it's just easier to use

---------23:33----------
that way so you just have to trust me

---------23:34----------
when I tell you what Volta does I read

---------23:36----------
yeah it makes life a little easier for

---------23:39----------
me to have that desk space free okay now

---------23:46----------
when I look in that area let's see let's

---------23:53----------
check out that piece its SMC reset

---------23:58----------
present unfortunately it is I can't

---------24:01----------
blame you missing for anything it's not

---------24:03----------
working but these points over here don't

---------24:05----------
look very nice before she goes oh it's

---------24:12----------
absolute [ __ ] I don't care about CPU

---------24:15----------
voltage sense I don't give a flying [ __ ]

---------24:16----------
of a [ __ ] about LCD backlight sense

---------24:19----------
because this doesn't even turn on

---------24:30----------
ah let's see if voltage for the crystal

---------24:41----------
is present

---------24:49----------
who the power well I said before that I

---------24:51----------
didn't care about which is really stupid

---------24:54----------
of me to say that but that's probably

---------24:55----------
what's wrong okay

---------24:59----------
ladies and gentlemen I am an idiot all

---------25:02----------
right so let's let's go on and talk

---------25:03----------
about what's going on here

---------25:05----------
so PPV RTC g3 hot is one of the power

---------25:08----------
rails that I skipped over because I I

---------25:11----------
was just being an idiot this is cool

---------25:13----------
it's good to have me being an idiot on

---------25:14----------
camera because if I make stupid mistakes

---------25:17----------
then you'll kind of learn how to not

---------25:18----------
make those stupid mistakes so a PPP RTC

---------25:22----------
g3 huh three volt right three volts so

---------25:28----------
I'm gonna take my multimeter and move it

---------25:31----------
over here just so that you can see and

---------25:32----------
confirm that I'm an idiot

---------25:34----------
alright so I went over here to measure

---------25:37----------
it and I have 0.3 you know you can't see

---------25:43----------
that because the lighting here is too

---------25:45----------
obnoxious 0.3 that's not three that's

---------25:56----------
one tenth of what I actually [ __ ]

---------25:58----------
need and move over here I like you

---------26:01----------
better over here so now we're gonna go

---------26:04----------
and find out hmm this is slavery it's

---------26:19----------
worth it though my staff they they're

---------26:21----------
some of the best people that you're ever

---------26:24----------
gonna find seriously I'm not I'm not

---------26:25----------
saying that just cuz I think they may

---------26:27----------
watch this I know that they never ever

---------26:29----------
watch any of this stuff but they they

---------26:32----------
are the best staff that you can buy did

---------26:35----------
I say buy rent higher that's the word

---------26:38----------
I'm looking for higher but seriously

---------26:40----------
they and they are that they are as good

---------26:42----------
as it gets

---------26:42----------
you're not gonna find better people than

---------26:45----------
those they absolutely positively deserve

---------26:49----------
two weeks of additional vacation to have

---------26:52----------
fun in another country when you have

---------26:56----------
people that are constantly looking out

---------26:57----------
for you who are constantly

---------27:00----------
you know not just doing their job like

---------27:02----------
looking for all these little things that

---------27:03----------
could go wrong and just to fix them like

---------27:05----------
this is one of the things that I brag

---------27:06----------
about so you know there was an inspector

---------27:09----------
that came in right and the inspectors

---------27:10----------
for the the for the in New York they're

---------27:12----------
always looking for something they will

---------27:14----------
find something there is a 900-page book

---------27:16----------
and they are it's even says in the book

---------27:19----------
we are allowed to change the rules

---------27:21----------
anytime we want we can change any of

---------27:23----------
this and it's your responsibility to ask

---------27:26----------
us for updated codes we don't have to

---------27:28----------
tell you when we change the stupid [ __ ]

---------27:30----------
you have to look for it yourself so

---------27:32----------
things like for example not having your

---------27:34----------
license number on the top of the receipt

---------27:36----------
that's a fine not having your license

---------27:38----------
number on the business cards that's fine

---------27:41----------
so we switched over POS systems and I

---------27:44----------
used to have my license number on there

---------27:46----------
is my receipt I learned that the first

---------27:47----------
time but then I didn't on this so he we

---------27:51----------
noticed that the license number was

---------27:53----------
missing from a few of the receipts so

---------27:54----------
that dude actually dials like he did

---------27:58----------
something with the phone or something he

---------27:59----------
dialed over so it would look like he was

---------28:02----------
dealing with a customer then he goes

---------28:04----------
into repair she'll you know kinda buy

---------28:06----------
time he goes into the backend of repair

---------28:07----------
shop but with the monitor tilted back he

---------28:10----------
edits the HTML to put put in there the

---------28:13----------
license number of my business then he

---------28:17----------
prints a receipt he Quinn says ok I'm

---------28:19----------
printing a receipt for you right now and

---------28:21----------
then he printed for the customer that

---------28:22----------
they think he was pretending to be on

---------28:23----------
the phone with it comes out there and he

---------28:25----------
shows it to him he's like here see like

---------28:27----------
how many people are gonna do that how

---------28:28----------
many people for any salary are actually

---------28:30----------
gonna come up with some convoluted

---------28:31----------
little scheme to pretend that they're on

---------28:33----------
the phone so that they can change it in

---------28:35----------
in the backend of your POS system to

---------28:37----------
avoid you getting a fine they're not

---------28:39----------
gonna do that they're gonna say sorry

---------28:41----------
here's your fine and inspector came by

---------28:42----------
but like people like that like those are

---------28:44----------
the people that I'm saying that you

---------28:45----------
should hire so when I'm talking to you

---------28:47----------
about you know getting rid of people

---------28:50----------
that are not really building your

---------28:52----------
business or helping your business that's

---------28:54----------
what I'm talking about the people that I

---------28:56----------
have I'm will most likely never find

---------28:58----------
these people again over the course of my

---------28:59----------
life I'll find new employees I'll find

---------29:01----------
your dedicated people but people with

---------29:03----------
that that just general mindset of what

---------29:05----------
is going on around me at all times how

---------29:07----------
can I make what's going on around me

---------29:09----------
work better at all times like I know

---------29:11----------
that I'm most likely never gonna find

---------29:13----------
again anyway so PPV are TCG three hot

---------29:17----------
back to this [ __ ]

---------29:18----------
so PPV are TCG three hot comes out of

---------29:22----------
you nineteen hundred and this also

---------29:24----------
creates the clock for the PCH okay we're

---------29:27----------
starting to get somewhere here so 32

---------29:30----------
kilohertz right which you know I didn't

---------29:32----------
check this you know I didn't check this

---------29:34----------
because every single [ __ ] board that I

---------29:37----------
have checked this on for like at least

---------29:39----------
six months even when this water on the

---------29:41----------
chip has the 32 killer its clock signal

---------29:43----------
I know I need it and I know if I don't

---------29:45----------
have it that my PCH won't work or my mCP

---------29:47----------
won't work but it's never missing it's

---------29:49----------
always there I've just kind of gotten

---------29:51----------
used to having it and even though that's

---------29:53----------
the first thing you should check on the

---------29:54----------
oscilloscope which by the way is not on

---------29:56----------
my desk because I forgot to bring it out

---------29:58----------
here that's probably one of the reasons

---------29:59----------
I didn't [ __ ] check it is yeah I

---------30:03----------
should have checked that I'm an idiot

---------30:05----------
and I should not be doing this I should

---------30:07----------
not be teaching a class and how to fix

---------30:09----------
boards or putting up a youtube series

---------30:11----------
telling people on how to do it because

---------30:12----------
I'm [ __ ] clueless I'm not using my

---------30:14----------
brain so PPV anyway so PCH clock 32k RTC

---------30:19----------
x1 that now if you know anything about

---------30:22----------
how computers work you probably know

---------30:23----------
that they work based on a clock so four

---------30:26----------
different components to talk to one

---------30:28----------
another or four different company not

---------30:29----------
for different stuff but the vendor does

---------30:31----------
work in tandem they have to be working

---------30:33----------
on a clock think of your like audio if

---------30:36----------
any of you guys that work in audio and

---------30:37----------
you have you notes say you have a

---------30:39----------
digital to analog converter and you want

---------30:41----------
to run another one so let's say you have

---------30:43----------
two digital to analog converters so

---------30:45----------
instead of having sixteen channels you

---------30:47----------
have 32 channels because you want more

---------30:48----------
tracks you need to link them together

---------30:50----------
we're also going to get something called

---------30:52----------
jitter which is a nightmare and

---------30:54----------
[ __ ] of terrible awful sound

---------30:56----------
because they're not working at the exact

---------30:58----------
same time so this track is gonna be kind

---------31:00----------
of moved in phase versus this one it's

---------31:01----------
just a whole mess same is true here we

---------31:04----------
have a CPU a PCH you have other parts of

---------31:06----------
the computer you have Thunderbolt the

---------31:07----------
USB controller hub all sorts of other

---------31:09----------
things that only to work in tandem so

---------31:11----------
I'm sending data while I'm listening to

---------31:13----------
data I'm sending it back while you're

---------31:15----------
listening this all needs to happen on

---------31:17----------
the clock if I'm talking at the same

---------31:19----------
time that you're talking we're just

---------31:21----------
nobody's gonna hear anything and it's

---------31:22----------
just gonna be [ __ ] so while people

---------31:24----------
were very often interrupt one another

---------31:26----------
and you know we won't be able to

---------31:27----------
understand what the [ __ ] is going on

---------31:29----------
because we're interrupting and debating

---------31:30----------
just watch a political debate if you

---------31:32----------
want to see an example of this a

---------31:33----------
political debate is the result that

---------31:35----------
resulting mess at the end where

---------31:37----------
everybody's kind of yelling at the same

---------31:38----------
time that happens because humans don't

---------31:41----------
have are not smart enough to have a you

---------31:44----------
19:52 create a clock signal so that you

---------31:46----------
talk while you shut the [ __ ] up then you

---------31:48----------
shut the [ __ ] up set he can talk without

---------31:50----------
a clock signal nothing is gonna happen

---------31:52----------
and that ship is putting out 0.3 volts

---------31:55----------
instead of 3 volts now that goes over to

---------31:59----------
my PCH I've done an awful job of

---------32:01----------
explaining that because I just my brain

---------32:04----------
is just dead right now so I'll probably

---------32:06----------
get a bunch of trolls on that shut up

---------32:12----------
Sharky but you know oh well [ __ ] those

---------32:17----------
people anyway so that goes to the CPU

---------32:20----------
anyway so this ship is probably [ __ ]

---------32:23----------
let's see what you 1900 looks like so

---------32:26----------
let's go over here you 1900 you 1900 you

---------32:34----------
1900 looks like [ __ ] and balls alright

---------32:42----------
look at that little get a [ __ ] up

---------32:43----------
[ __ ] little capacitor alright and

---------32:47----------
that's a little red pro point buy there

---------32:49----------
that's right by my BIOS chip okay time

---------32:52----------
to turn on the iron and finally get

---------32:54----------
something done so that's another sign of

---------33:00----------
it like an idiot touched board by the

---------33:02----------
way if you got a few people who want to

---------33:03----------
be able to tell this stuff I mean even

---------33:05----------
though I'm dead tired and even though

---------33:07----------
it's the end of the day and I really

---------33:08----------
just like I I'm not thinking straight

---------33:10----------
I think extreme I brain is not working

---------33:15----------
at more than 8 percent capacity right

---------33:18----------
now so I don't touch my soldering iron

---------33:20----------
until I know that I have a diagnosis and

---------33:23----------
you saw that where I kind of realized

---------33:24----------
that I was spinning my wheels and once I

---------33:27----------
got to the point where I realized that

---------33:28----------
I'm spinning my wheels and I have a

---------33:29----------
circular problem so you know I don't

---------33:32----------
have 3.3 PC H is not producing PM sleep

---------33:35----------
signal from my fist for rails my ass for

---------33:38----------
I need

---------33:39----------
sleep signal from the PCH PCH needs the

---------33:42----------
BIOS to work BIOS doesn't work because

---------33:44----------
it's missing three volts missing three

---------33:46----------
volts because the PCH is not putting out

---------33:48----------
a sus enable signal sus it's like the

---------33:51----------
circular [ __ ] I realized at that point

---------33:53----------
that I should take a step back and just

---------33:56----------
kind of start over because I may have

---------33:59----------
made a mistake and I did make a mistake

---------34:01----------
I didn't check a rail and I'll when I'm

---------34:03----------
editing this I'll probably figure out

---------34:04----------
the stupid [ __ ] reason that I had for

---------34:07----------
skipping over that rail but yeah just

---------34:10----------
don't do that that's dumb

---------34:12----------
all right so I have a donor board here

---------34:14----------
and I'm gonna take that part from the

---------34:16----------
donor board along with that cap and I'm

---------34:18----------
gonna put it on here now I also didn't

---------34:20----------
manage to check whether this chip has

---------34:21----------
voltage going into it so the VDD pin of

---------34:24----------
this chip is but I'm pretty sure that

---------34:26----------
it's fine because PPV pp 3 b3 s5 is the

---------34:31----------
V is at the VDD pin so that's what's

---------34:34----------
gonna be powering it and pp 3 b3 s5 was

---------34:37----------
fine and the trace that I don't think

---------34:40----------
that there's any trace damage there I

---------34:41----------
didn't see any except for the PPV RTC 3v

---------34:45----------
whatever the [ __ ] was out so let's this

---------34:50----------
is carry on with my scheduled replacing

---------34:53----------
of this crap by the way if you notice

---------35:00----------
that it seems like I saw her a lot

---------35:01----------
easier than you even though I suck at it

---------35:03----------
it's probably because you have a $100 ie

---------35:05----------
piece of [ __ ] and I have a hotter

---------35:07----------
station that I spent $650 on so this

---------35:12----------
chip is gonna come off very quickly and

---------35:14----------
on the newer air boards but these newer

---------35:16----------
air boards you're gonna notice that it's

---------35:17----------
really difficult to take a lot of these

---------35:18----------
components off because every year they

---------35:22----------
come up with a new way to have these

---------35:23----------
boards you know just kind of act as a

---------35:25----------
heat sink and if you're using a shitty

---------35:29----------
soldering iron and then you're kind of

---------35:31----------
screwed

---------35:32----------
like as time goes on your cheapness will

---------35:35----------
screw you more and more

---------35:50----------
come on heat up mofo beep mofo

---------35:55----------
beep you Martha okay let's get rid of

---------36:00----------
that shitty old leather that free solder

---------36:06----------
junk goodbye Martha

---------36:38----------
you know what would be funny if I fix

---------36:41----------
this and Thunderbolt works because that

---------36:43----------
chip that's [ __ ] up it's it's that

---------36:45----------
looks [ __ ] up I shouldn't say is

---------36:47----------
[ __ ] up is the Thunderbolt ship and

---------36:49----------
again just just because it's these

---------36:50----------
people just because I I know who sent

---------36:53----------
this board I know the level of knowledge

---------36:55----------
they have I know some of this this [ __ ]

---------36:57----------
that they have done in the past I I just

---------37:00----------
just something tells me that that

---------37:01----------
Thunderbolt ship is good just because

---------37:03----------
they said it wasn't and look here it

---------37:06----------
looks like there may be a missing

---------37:07----------
component I'm not sure if it's no

---------37:08----------
stuffed or not one way to find out see

---------37:14----------
that you trolls I didn't leave a single

---------37:15----------
strand on the board single strand of

---------37:19----------
q-tips oh [ __ ] off so this right over

---------37:22----------
here this this kind of implies that they

---------37:24----------
used to be something there let's see

---------37:27----------
what mr. donor board has to say about

---------37:28----------
that

---------37:29----------
actually don't avoid says nothing okay

---------37:34----------
never mind

---------37:35----------
stupid theory probably know stuff all

---------37:38----------
right so let's replace that ship [ __ ]

---------37:40----------
wait what do you mean replace the ship

---------37:42----------
but solder on the pads jackass alright

---------37:44----------
let's put some solder on the pads and

---------37:45----------
then replace thank you for this [ __ ]

---------37:50----------
syringe oh okay I put too much [ __ ] says

---------37:59----------
is my hallmark people like to complain

---------38:02----------
about it and I love to not care all

---------38:05----------
right so let's heat up

---------38:24----------
oh [ __ ] too much cider on the Senate pad

---------38:28----------
that's another hallmark of my not being

---------38:34----------
able to solder is actually a hallmark of

---------38:35----------
mine oh well you'll see it's not gonna

---------38:41----------
matter in a second anyway

---------38:50----------
I lost the orientation of the chip I

---------38:54----------
clipped [ __ ] mofo mobile luckily I have

---------39:07----------
another one thanks to David at Advance

---------39:13----------
tree works for providing me with these

---------39:14----------
donor boards at a reasonable price

---------39:20----------
very quickly - thank you David Center

---------39:27----------
Pat is too much solder oh no what are we

---------39:30----------
gonna do the center pad is too much

---------39:31----------
solder I guess you can't side of the

---------39:33----------
chip oh wait I forgot I don't care

---------39:37----------
humble okay let's get mr. Kirby tip I

---------39:42----------
love mr. Kirby tip it fixes all of my

---------39:45----------
fuck-ups Sharky just [ __ ] about my

---------39:49----------
fuck-ups with Kirby tip every tip

---------39:51----------
actually does something about it if I

---------40:05----------
know how to solder I'd be dangerous

---------40:30----------
feeling this board is gonna have

---------40:31----------
Thunderbolts right out the box

---------40:34----------
something's just

---------40:43----------
hey don't popcorn the crystal right next

---------40:46----------
door

---------41:13----------
okay now time for that little capacitor

---------41:15----------
to get humbled

---------41:34----------
whoops

---------41:37----------
I did everything I shouldn't while I was

---------41:39----------
doing that I left a piece of corrosion i

---------41:45----------
tipped over my chip soldered everything

---------41:49----------
on sideways and I got flux on my finger

---------41:56----------
mofo alright so I'm gonna take a

---------41:59----------
bathroom break to wash the flux off of

---------42:03----------
my finger and what do you know the fan

---------42:09----------
spins because I fixed my problem now

---------42:12----------
what again what I'm really interested in

---------42:14----------
here what I really want to know does

---------42:16----------
Thunderbolt work because if this is

---------42:18----------
DisplayPort on this [ __ ] works let's see

---------42:21----------
if that's just for display port of

---------42:22----------
Thunderbolt I just got it I got to see

---------42:23----------
this

---------42:24----------
I mean but I really got to do is go home

---------42:26----------
and meet my bed but you 3220 I don't

---------42:31----------
even know if that's just DisplayPort

---------42:33----------
Thunderbolt both you 3220 and I'm kind

---------42:37----------
of too tired to figure it out right now

---------42:43----------
Thunderbolt

---------42:45----------
DDC dad DDC clock oh yeah you are four

---------42:50----------
screens so I don't have to have a

---------42:52----------
Thunderbolt device I can just use my

---------42:53----------
crappy little VGA Thunderbolt

---------42:56----------
DisplayPort thingy that I have here C DD

---------42:59----------
C if you just search just Google and

---------43:02----------
you'll find out with this this stuff DD

---------43:04----------
C is the circuit that allows the screen

---------43:06----------
to talk to the graphics chip and vice

---------43:08----------
versa so I know that that is something

---------43:09----------
to do with the screen so we're gonna

---------43:11----------
take a short break while I wash the flux

---------43:13----------
off my hands take a piss

---------43:15----------
okay time to put this back together and

---------43:19----------
see what's going on and then go home oh

---------43:27----------
my Kitty's gonna miss me he's gonna

---------43:30----------
scream at me when I get home my kitty

---------43:32----------
gets so pissed off when I don't pay

---------43:35----------
attention to him you have no idea when I

---------43:38----------
come home late he just runs up to me and

---------43:40----------
goes

---------43:44----------
is adorable I love my kitty cat he's the

---------43:48----------
cutest kitty cat I've ever met

---------43:50----------
turn off air filter turn off hackle turn

---------43:56----------
off the little microscope light oh I

---------44:01----------
need to iron this shirt you know it was

---------44:04----------
actually good when I woke up this

---------44:06----------
morning I think part of what makes a

---------44:07----------
shirt start to look like this is not

---------44:09----------
lack of ironing so much as it is 12 to

---------44:12----------
14 hour work day like my shirt kind of

---------44:15----------
starts to take on characteristics that I

---------44:17----------
feel this is gonna boot slow as [ __ ]

---------44:21----------
because it doesn't have a battery and I

---------44:23----------
don't feel like getting up to get a

---------44:24----------
battery oh well let's see if you have a

---------44:30----------
working keyboard you're gonna make

---------44:31----------
anything easy for me a piece of [ __ ] I

---------44:33----------
have here I have an F at SSD and I have

---------44:36----------
a USB 3 thingy here so that I can boot

---------44:39----------
into an operating system

---------44:41----------
come here mofo yes option key works

---------44:47----------
awesome I can boot into an operating

---------44:51----------
system I want to see that that Thunder

---------44:53----------
both [ __ ] works good yeah visual

---------44:55----------
inspection really only gets you so far

---------44:57----------
at the end of the day what you need is a

---------45:00----------
[ __ ] brain Oh God

---------45:02----------
oh okay so my SSD for some reason has

---------45:05----------
Snow Leopard on it which is never gonna

---------45:07----------
boot in this computer what do I have on

---------45:12----------
here tell me one of these is a operating

---------45:14----------
system I can use Mavericks Yosemite give

---------45:17----------
me something here we go

---------45:19----------
Yosemite but it's on a hard drive which

---------45:21----------
means it's gonna take forever to boot

---------45:23----------
okay it's like hard drives like hard

---------45:26----------
drives are kind of like lead paint or

---------45:28----------
asbestosis it's just one of those things

---------45:30----------
that we need to eradicate completely

---------45:32----------
they are they're a [ __ ] cancer on the

---------45:34----------
world they really are I mean when I use

---------45:38----------
a computer with a hard drive and I click

---------45:40----------
the search button and then before I

---------45:42----------
haven't even had to search term in yet

---------45:44----------
but I see a pin wheel no no no no none

---------45:48----------
of that none of that random waiting [ __ ]

---------45:50----------
that needs to be done with it's one

---------45:52----------
thing if there was no solution but

---------45:53----------
knowing that there's a solution and

---------45:54----------
seeing that crap

---------45:55----------
all right so let's unplug this thing

---------45:57----------
because it's the only [ __ ]

---------45:58----------
Thunderbolt port accessory I have in the

---------46:01----------
whole store which people are gonna troll

---------46:03----------
because I have a laptop top repair shop

---------46:06----------
don't you test the Thunderbolt port full

---------46:08----------
functionality no I don't and I half the

---------46:11----------
time and actually cut it out of the

---------46:12----------
board like an appendix so what do you

---------46:15----------
think of that you purists would be so

---------46:19----------
[ __ ] pissed right now if you knew

---------46:21----------
that oh my god okay check it out so

---------46:28----------
let's do one chip again Lee here's the

---------46:30----------
thing with that [ __ ] with that self

---------46:32----------
estimate [ __ ] if you listen to your

---------46:33----------
customers look that's the issue I see

---------46:37----------
that's corroding replace that one ship

---------46:39----------
that's corroded oh your Thunderbolt chip

---------46:41----------
is corroded well guess what [ __ ]

---------46:43----------
Thunderbolt works [ __ ]

---------46:47----------
not only does Thunderbolt work but your

---------46:52----------
machine was dead so why point out the

---------46:56----------
Thunderbolt chip look at me moving the

---------46:58----------
mouse and trying to get it to show up on

---------46:59----------
here I'm being an idiot right now but

---------47:02----------
still Thunderbolt is [ __ ] fine I knew

---------47:07----------
it I knew the Thunderbolt gonna be fine

---------47:11----------
man my [ __ ] serious like this this is

---------47:15----------
why I like I love my I love all the

---------47:17----------
policies that I have my business I love

---------47:19----------
them and they all have good reason you

---------47:20----------
know if you like I don't I don't do that

---------47:25----------
thing with like the like the no fix you

---------47:28----------
pay if you have your own estimate I

---------47:29----------
firmly believe that if you bring your

---------47:31----------
own estimate that you should be

---------47:32----------
responsible for that right so and I'm

---------47:35----------
being kind of harsh just I'm honestly

---------47:36----------
being a dick because I'm tired and I

---------47:38----------
want to go home it's it's not like they

---------47:40----------
wanted me to replace that one ship they

---------47:42----------
they they they were probably just trying

---------47:43----------
to be helpful and put a little sticker

---------47:44----------
on was broken but so I'm going to see a

---------47:46----------
poster which is like you know this and

---------47:47----------
replace this and it's like just and I'm

---------47:49----------
just trying to make a general point here

---------47:50----------
I'm not really making fun of these

---------47:53----------
people why I will I am making fun of

---------47:54----------
these people but I'm not making fun of

---------47:56----------
them in this particular case for that

---------47:57----------
particular thing it's just it's a thing

---------47:59----------
that happens all the time are people

---------48:00----------
like I want you to replace just this

---------48:01----------
chip I want you to replace justice Jack

---------48:03----------
I want to know how much is it replace

---------48:05----------
these two resistors by the BIOS chip I

---------48:07----------
know they're bad

---------48:08----------
3:25 plus tax you know why do you know

---------48:11----------
why because when I say it's 50 bucks to

---------48:13----------
replace those resistors when I say it's

---------48:15----------
50 bucks to replace those two resistors

---------48:17----------
you know what's gonna happen when it's

---------48:19----------
not those two resistors and I say okay

---------48:20----------
give me the 50 bucks and doesn't turn on

---------48:21----------
you're not gonna want to take

---------48:23----------
responsibility for your estimate being

---------48:25----------
bad you're not you're gonna think that I

---------48:27----------
[ __ ] it up

---------48:28----------
you're gonna think that either I [ __ ]

---------48:29----------
it up because I'm an idiot or even worse

---------48:31----------
you're gonna think that I [ __ ] it up

---------48:33----------
on purpose

---------48:34----------
so that I could now upsell you on

---------48:36----------
motherboard or pal and that creates

---------48:38----------
conflict and conflict more time I spend

---------48:40----------
with conflict the less time I spend

---------48:42----------
dealing with customers I want to deal

---------48:43----------
with the less time I spend in the

---------48:44----------
microscope the last time I spent making

---------48:46----------
money so what do I do I eliminate

---------48:48----------
conflict what's a great way to eliminate

---------48:50----------
it away okay how about we just don't

---------48:52----------
have a lower tier of service how about

---------48:54----------
there isn't any I'll just replace what

---------48:56----------
you want me to replace or 50 bucks

---------48:57----------
there's no motivation to upsell you

---------49:00----------
because there's no upselling we start up

---------49:03----------
here there is nothing down here I have

---------49:06----------
nothing else to offer you so there's no

---------49:08----------
reason for me to lie and now there's no

---------49:10----------
reason for me to lie there's no conflict

---------49:12----------
which is beautiful but again like people

---------49:14----------
people in general they just they

---------49:17----------
understand the concept I can explain it

---------49:19----------
to them if your estimate is wrong you

---------49:21----------
will have to pay anyway because I

---------49:23----------
started doing something not because I'm

---------49:25----------
of my estimate I spent an hour of time

---------49:27----------
going down your rabbit hole if I go down

---------49:30----------
my rabbit hole for an hour that's on me

---------49:33----------
because I screwed up but if why would I

---------49:36----------
go down your rabbit hole for an hour and

---------49:38----------
not get paid at the end of it why should

---------49:40----------
I have that one hour of my life taken

---------49:42----------
away from me because you were wrong

---------49:44----------
see if I'm wrong I deserve that hour of

---------49:47----------
my life taken away with no compensation

---------49:48----------
but if you are wrong and you ask me to

---------49:51----------
do something why should I have that time

---------49:53----------
taken away that's why a lot of people

---------49:54----------
have these business models where you

---------49:56----------
have to pay them regardless of whether

---------49:57----------
they fix it if you tell them to do a

---------49:58----------
certain thing but the reality here is no

---------50:02----------
matter how you explain it to people no

---------50:03----------
matter how clear you make it at the end

---------50:06----------
of the day when they're handing you $50

---------50:09----------
to get back something that doesn't work

---------50:11----------
they're going to feel bad about it and

---------50:14----------
when people feel again this is this is

---------50:16----------
the problem with feelings that's why I

---------50:17----------
just I feel like feelings have no place

---------50:19----------
in technology and why I'm just sick and

---------50:20----------
tired of hearing

---------50:21----------
I feel this and I feel that is because

---------50:24----------
it takes away from your rational

---------50:25----------
thinking rationally speaking you [ __ ]

---------50:28----------
up rationally speaking you know you

---------50:29----------
[ __ ] up rationally speaking in this

---------50:31----------
particular segment of the world again

---------50:33----------
well you may know way more about me than

---------50:35----------
I do about chemistry astrology

---------50:37----------
car repair but politics I know more than

---------50:40----------
you do about component-level border

---------50:42----------
paper but you decided that you wanted me

---------50:47----------
to do this because you know better than

---------50:49----------
me

---------50:49----------
okay that's great but you're gonna feel

---------50:52----------
bad when you get back that thing that

---------50:53----------
doesn't work so now the feeling that

---------50:56----------
that silly feeling that makes no sense

---------50:57----------
is going to overcome the rational

---------50:59----------
thought that maybe this guy was right

---------51:01----------
who does this for 12 hours a day every

---------51:03----------
single day of the year for many years

---------51:05----------
versus me who I just looked at this [ __ ]

---------51:08----------
and I just came up with this idea in my

---------51:09----------
head that this is wrong because I'm just

---------51:11----------
such a genius yeah I know they're not

---------51:13----------
gonna think that rational thought

---------51:14----------
they're just gonna feel bad and then

---------51:16----------
that that feeling bad kind of gets

---------51:17----------
compounded and then they start using

---------51:19----------
that as fuel for all their their

---------51:22----------
accusations and for their arguments and

---------51:25----------
for their bad reviews and it's again

---------51:27----------
just get rid of it

---------51:28----------
just have one basic tear of service

---------51:30----------
which is either pay me or [ __ ] you at

---------51:34----------
this price and it just gets rid of all

---------51:36----------
that because you know what I find so

---------51:38----------
often is that people are not willing to

---------51:40----------
pay for the consequences of their

---------51:43----------
mistakes they don't want to so and it

---------51:46----------
doesn't matter what you say it doesn't

---------51:48----------
matter what you do it doesn't matter

---------51:49----------
what you get them to sign if you tell

---------51:51----------
somebody I will charge you $50 to

---------51:54----------
replace this charge port because you

---------51:56----------
asked me to replace this charge port and

---------51:57----------
if I replace that charge port and it

---------51:59----------
still doesn't turn on that's on you you

---------52:02----------
could say that a thousand times but if

---------52:05----------
if you give it back to them you say I

---------52:07----------
replace your charge port here is voltage

---------52:09----------
going through to every part of the board

---------52:11----------
your board don't work they're gonna go

---------52:12----------
man you [ __ ] it up or man I don't want

---------52:15----------
to pay your man it's a professional man

---------52:17----------
I feel like I got it again I don't want

---------52:20----------
to deal with that I don't I totally

---------52:22----------
understand that for so many of these

---------52:24----------
devices it makes absolutely no [ __ ]

---------52:27----------
sense to pay what it is I'm asking you

---------52:30----------
to pay I get that and I'm honest with

---------52:33----------
you and I'll tell you you should not pay

---------52:34----------
me to do that

---------52:35----------
but at the same time don't try to get me

---------52:37----------
to change my business model I get so

---------52:40----------
many calls it's like how much to replace

---------52:42----------
my back left fuse how much to replace

---------52:44----------
see seven seven seven one how much would

---------52:46----------
it be to replace this chip no you know

---------52:49----------
why cuz again I'll replace that chip

---------52:51----------
it's still gonna be dead because you're

---------52:53----------
wrong and if I even had the time if I

---------52:55----------
had the time in the day to explain to

---------52:58----------
you why you were wrong I would be here

---------52:59----------
fixing motherboards at 1:00 to 3:00 in

---------53:01----------
the morning if I even had the time to

---------53:02----------
explain why you're on this ghetto get

---------53:03----------
away from them you're probably wrong and

---------53:06----------
when you are wrong you are not gonna

---------53:08----------
want to pay that fifty bucks

---------53:10----------
and there will be conflict and you can

---------53:12----------
say that you'll be fine paying it but

---------53:13----------
again I've been doing this now for about

---------53:15----------
seventeen and a half years

---------53:17----------
and in that seventeen and a half years I

---------53:19----------
really honestly truthfully cannot

---------53:21----------
remember a single [ __ ] time or I have

---------53:23----------
taken money and not made something

---------53:25----------
better where the other person has not

---------53:27----------
been pissed off or argued about it and

---------53:29----------
where I felt good I don't feel good

---------53:31----------
taking money without doing something I

---------53:33----------
don't feel good being a part of failure

---------53:35----------
at the end of the day as mean as

---------53:37----------
terrible as a lot of people think I am

---------53:39----------
from this YouTube channel at the end of

---------53:40----------
the day even if you are the reason that

---------53:43----------
I wasted an hour of my life even if I

---------53:46----------
know deep down inside that I I followed

---------53:48----------
this path I replaced this chip and I

---------53:51----------
wasted my time doing it because you

---------53:52----------
wanted me to do it when it was the wrong

---------53:54----------
thing to do and it wasn't the actual

---------53:55----------
proper fix and I know that you should

---------53:58----------
have to pay me I don't have it in me to

---------53:59----------
take that money I really honestly don't

---------54:01----------
somewhere deep down inside I can only

---------54:03----------
take money if I know that I've improved

---------54:05----------
a device I've built a system that works

---------54:08----------
I can't I can't take money and be a part

---------54:10----------
of putting [ __ ] up crap back into the

---------54:12----------
world I can't take money without knowing

---------54:15----------
that I've actually provided something of

---------54:17----------
value if I have not provided something

---------54:19----------
of value I I don't feel good about

---------54:20----------
taking money and I just can't do it but

---------54:23----------
I know that if I don't take money for my

---------54:25----------
time that I am going to stop paying rent

---------54:28----------
and I'm not gonna have all these nice

---------54:29----------
things and I'm not gonna have a stayer

---------54:31----------
money to pay a staff and I'm not gonna

---------54:33----------
have a business and I'll be screwed so I

---------54:35----------
don't know if at that type of tier and

---------54:36----------
again I really strongly advise everybody

---------54:39----------
who is doing anything like this is a

---------54:41----------
living so come up with a no fix no pay

---------54:44----------
solution that works for you come up with

---------54:46----------
a no fix no pay business model that

---------54:48----------
works for you and if

---------54:49----------
you really honestly legitimately realize

---------54:51----------
that there is absolutely no way to make

---------54:53----------
no fix no pay work for you look at what

---------54:55----------
it is you're offering look at the

---------54:56----------
services you're offering

---------54:57----------
are you offering services that are high

---------54:59----------
value are you kind of doing something

---------55:00----------
where you're just all like you're all

---------55:02----------
fighting and arguing over pennies

---------55:04----------
nickels and dimes so you really can't

---------55:06----------
have that because every single one of

---------55:07----------
those pennies is that very important and

---------55:10----------
if that's it try to move on to doing

---------55:12----------
something else again like I'm told I

---------55:14----------
understand why you don't want to pay me

---------55:15----------
300 bucks to replace a connector I get

---------55:18----------
it I understand I will happily refer you

---------55:20----------
to other people I will happily show you

---------55:21----------
to people that will more than happily do

---------55:23----------
that for 35 or 40 bucks and that's okay

---------55:26----------
just don't ask me to change my business

---------55:29----------
model on account of you my business

---------55:31----------
model allows me to get a lot of things

---------55:33----------
done in a very very short tiny period of

---------55:36----------
time as just one person and without that

---------55:39----------
business model without that structure I

---------55:41----------
have my business would lose its it we

---------55:44----------
just lose its dignity it would lose its

---------55:46----------
ability to to avoid [ __ ] so it

---------55:49----------
would avoid its ability to get all those

---------55:51----------
things done in a short period of time

---------55:53----------
and make a lot of people happy because

---------55:54----------
once you start going down the rabbit

---------55:55----------
hole you start spending time on conflict

---------55:58----------
you don't spend time fixing stuff you

---------56:00----------
don't spend time fixing stuff you don't

---------56:01----------
give it back to the customer then you

---------56:02----------
have to spend time arguing with all the

---------56:04----------
other customers that you didn't fix

---------56:05----------
things for and then you spend all that

---------56:07----------
time arguing with them so you're not

---------56:09----------
spending time fixing stuff so then you

---------56:10----------
spend time arguing with the other people

---------56:11----------
that you're not fixing stuff for it just

---------56:13----------
creates this dangerous cycle which is

---------56:15----------
what all these repair stores go down

---------56:16----------
which is what I'm trying to get all you

---------56:18----------
guys to avoid through this video series

---------56:20----------
I'm probably talking out of my ass

---------56:22----------
because it's really late and I'm really

---------56:25----------
tired so I'll call it a day here and

---------56:27----------
yeah board works and I'm quite happy I'm

---------56:31----------
gonna test that I'm gonna run a SD on it

---------56:33----------
if everything works it'll go back to the

---------56:34----------
customer and thank you for watching and

---------56:36----------
as always I hope you learned something
