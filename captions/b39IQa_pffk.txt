---------00:00----------
people how's it going so today we're

---------00:01----------
going to get started working on yet

---------00:02----------
another dead macbook

---------00:04----------
let's see what's wrong with this so

---------00:06----------
according to the customer

---------00:08----------
the issue with this macbook is that they

---------00:10----------
had no backlight

---------00:12----------
and then it appears they made the

---------00:13----------
mistake of opening the macbook

---------00:16----------
after opening the macbook now it has no

---------00:19----------
image and no backlight

---------00:21----------
joy let's see if we can find

---------00:24----------
some hints all right

---------00:28----------
so first things first there is going to

---------00:31----------
be

---------00:32----------
by the screen an inductor

---------00:35----------
between the 3.3 volt

---------00:38----------
power line and the screen i'll show you

---------00:41----------
that on the schematic over here an

---------00:45----------
820-00165

---------00:49----------
how's everybody doing in the chat here

---------00:51----------
today hope you're all having a lovely

---------00:53----------
day

---------00:54----------
free of covid

---------01:01----------
we're stuck here in stage four in new

---------01:03----------
york city

---------01:05----------
what what is there a stage five who

---------01:08----------
knows

---------01:09----------
maybe so this is an inductor that looks

---------01:14----------
like it's destroyed

---------01:18----------
this is an inductor this is the screen

---------01:21----------
screen has backlight screen has

---------01:25----------
power needs power to make image needs

---------01:28----------
backlight lines of a backlight

---------01:30----------
this is the inductor that sits between

---------01:33----------
the three volt output of u8300

---------01:35----------
and the screen and it's destroyed

---------01:39----------
hmm the first thing i'd want to do

---------01:43----------
is there's a short circuit present

---------01:44----------
because if there is a short circuit

---------01:45----------
present

---------01:46----------
then it's just going to blow when i

---------01:47----------
replace it and i don't want it to blow

---------01:49----------
when i replace it

---------01:51----------
so i'm going to turn my multimeter on

---------01:53----------
i'm going to turn on paul daniels

---------01:54----------
amazing multimeter software that always

---------01:57----------
works properly

---------02:00----------
and we'll see

---------02:18----------
no short so it's safe to replace that

---------02:20----------
now

---------02:21----------
next up is the backlight issue so you

---------02:23----------
have corrosion see this

---------02:25----------
that's liquid damage right over there

---------02:29----------
yes you see it much better when i get

---------02:30----------
the camera to focus don't you

---------02:36----------
now this here's the way it works so this

---------02:38----------
is backlight power is going to go

---------02:39----------
through this fuse

---------02:41----------
after this fuse the transistor is going

---------02:44----------
to open or close based on what it's told

---------02:46----------
to do

---------02:47----------
now there's a signal that's going to go

---------02:48----------
to this transistor which is then

---------02:51----------
going to allow a voltage divider to work

---------02:52----------
which is going to open this transistor

---------02:54----------
this is the voltage divider by the way

---------02:55----------
cd02

---------02:57----------
then once this transistor opens the

---------02:59----------
power will go through to the backlight

---------03:00----------
circuit

---------03:01----------
through the inductor give a diode caps

---------03:04----------
on output

---------03:04----------
and out and i'm going to guess that the

---------03:07----------
corrosion

---------03:08----------
is going to have gone to the back light

---------03:09----------
i see on the other side of the board

---------03:11----------
i'm also going to guess that this over

---------03:13----------
here

---------03:15----------
which is all scratched up that's so sad

---------03:20----------
why you scratch

---------03:24----------
so sad we're going to

---------03:27----------
get the other side of the board check it

---------03:29----------
out and see what's going on there

---------03:31----------
so let's take this board out of the case

---------03:36----------
by the way if anybody is interested in a

---------03:39----------
job

---------03:40----------
and is good at hard drive

---------03:43----------
data recovery and has some experience

---------03:45----------
using software like pc3000

---------03:47----------
clean room environments please do email

---------03:49----------
me at louis rossman group dot com if you

---------03:51----------
don't have experience and you email me

---------03:53----------
i will i will personally make effort

---------03:57----------
i will personally put an effort john

---------04:00----------
steve is still here

---------04:02----------
i want to get steve some assistant so

---------04:04----------
that he can actually make time to do

---------04:05----------
some videos

---------04:11----------
but steve is here steve is a valuable

---------04:15----------
valuable asset

---------04:20----------
no steve has not gotten tired of getting

---------04:21----------
shot in the dick with the nerf gun

---------04:23----------
all right so for no backlight that often

---------04:25----------
means that we have corrosion on the dcn

---------04:29----------
which on this machine is totally clean

---------04:31----------
or on the led driver

---------04:37----------
which is totally clean

---------04:41----------
so i think it might just have to do with

---------04:42----------
the shorted capacitor

---------04:44----------
and i'm going to show you how that

---------04:45----------
shorted capacitor is going to be doing

---------04:47----------
making

---------04:47----------
this not work on the schematic and the

---------04:51----------
board view you ready

---------04:52----------
all right so let's go over how this

---------04:55----------
works because the first time i looked at

---------04:56----------
this page this

---------04:57----------
honestly confused me beyond belief and i

---------05:00----------
was i had no idea what i was doing

---------05:02----------
okay ready guys big brain mode big brain

---------05:04----------
okay so this here

---------05:06----------
is the backlight fuse this here is

---------05:08----------
battery power pbsd3 hot 8.5 volt is

---------05:10----------
going to go through here

---------05:11----------
now what is this mess over here what is

---------05:15----------
all this [ __ ] okay let's let's make it

---------05:16----------
simple

---------05:17----------
so this is this is the backlight circuit

---------05:19----------
over here this is the power that's going

---------05:20----------
to go to your screen this whole thing is

---------05:21----------
a backlight circuit

---------05:23----------
the transistor is a switch it's going to

---------05:25----------
decide whether or not

---------05:27----------
power goes through to the backlight

---------05:28----------
circuit now this is

---------05:31----------
your standard p channel mosfet it says

---------05:33----------
the type up here

---------05:34----------
the way a p-channel mosfet works is the

---------05:37----------
power will flow from the source of the

---------05:38----------
drain

---------05:39----------
when the voltage in the gate is lower

---------05:42----------
than the voltage in the source not

---------05:44----------
higher

---------05:45----------
so if you were to look up this

---------05:46----------
transistor by googling this model number

---------05:48----------
you would find that pin 4 is the source

---------05:51----------
pin one two five six is the drain

---------05:53----------
and pin three is the gate

---------05:56----------
now you need to have lower voltage on

---------05:59----------
the gate than the source right

---------06:00----------
well here's what we do so you have this

---------06:03----------
resistor

---------06:04----------
r7788 that goes between the source

---------06:09----------
and the gate meaning that the voltage in

---------06:10----------
the source and the gate is always going

---------06:11----------
to be the same which means it's never

---------06:12----------
going to open remember this is kind of

---------06:14----------
like a light switch

---------06:15----------
so the way you get a light switch to

---------06:16----------
turn on or off is you flick it on or off

---------06:18----------
you know you physically move it here the

---------06:20----------
way you get the switch to turn so that

---------06:22----------
it passes

---------06:22----------
current is you send a certain amount of

---------06:24----------
power to the gate so you're going to

---------06:26----------
have

---------06:26----------
eight volts over here r-7788 is going to

---------06:29----------
take that eight volts from the source

---------06:30----------
and place it on the gate

---------06:31----------
meaning it's never going to open but

---------06:33----------
then you have what you could do is you

---------06:34----------
could place another resistor between the

---------06:36----------
gate and ground

---------06:37----------
that's going to then lower the voltage

---------06:39----------
on the gate without lowering the voltage

---------06:41----------
in the source

---------06:42----------
and allow it to open but before this

---------06:45----------
resistor can get to ground so that it

---------06:46----------
can be a voltage divider and lower the

---------06:48----------
voltage in the gate

---------06:52----------
then you're going to have to have this

---------06:54----------
transistor open

---------06:56----------
so what this is going to do this is an n

---------06:59----------
channel mosfet this is the opposite of a

---------07:00----------
p channel an

---------07:01----------
n-channel mosfet is only going to allow

---------07:03----------
power to go through when the power on

---------07:05----------
this

---------07:05----------
gate is less than the source an

---------07:08----------
n-channel is going to allow power to go

---------07:10----------
through when the power on the gate is

---------07:12----------
equal to or higher than the source when

---------07:15----------
i say power i mean

---------07:16----------
voltage so here the source is ground

---------07:20----------
zero volts so anything's going to be

---------07:21----------
higher than zero so if i send backlight

---------07:23----------
platform reset

---------07:24----------
that means that this is now connected

---------07:27----------
the switch is on

---------07:29----------
over here edp backlight enable

---------07:32----------
again this is going to wind up

---------07:33----------
disconnecting the source of the drain

---------07:35----------
which attaches ground to here

---------07:37----------
that's also going to be zero so if edb

---------07:38----------
backlight enable is

---------07:40----------
three volts then that's going to be more

---------07:42----------
than zero

---------07:43----------
because remember the source is going to

---------07:44----------
be ground the ground is zero

---------07:46----------
which means that this now turns on and

---------07:50----------
now the bottom of this resistor will go

---------07:52----------
to ground

---------07:53----------
because the bottom of that resistor is

---------07:54----------
going to go here and then here

---------07:56----------
and it's a ground so this is just a

---------07:58----------
bunch of switches

---------07:59----------
so these two signals over here are going

---------08:02----------
to turn

---------08:02----------
each of these transistors on so that

---------08:05----------
power is going to flow from source to

---------08:06----------
drain

---------08:07----------
up and that means that this will be now

---------08:11----------
a voltage divider

---------08:12----------
now if this is now a voltage divider

---------08:13----------
what that means is that

---------08:15----------
you're going to have go from having

---------08:16----------
eight volts up here

---------08:19----------
to about three or four volts over here

---------08:21----------
remember what a voltage divider is going

---------08:22----------
to do is you have that high voltage at

---------08:24----------
the top

---------08:26----------
then in the middle you're going to have

---------08:28----------
the divided voltage a lower voltage

---------08:30----------
because some of the stuff is going to

---------08:31----------
get sent to ground

---------08:32----------
so this resistance says okay some of the

---------08:34----------
eight volts gets to go here

---------08:36----------
and then this resistance says some of

---------08:38----------
that eight volts gets to go to ground

---------08:39----------
which is kind of like your recycle bin

---------08:40----------
in your trash can for

---------08:41----------
for power so what you're going to be

---------08:43----------
left with in the middle is like

---------08:45----------
four volts not zero not eight but like

---------08:47----------
four

---------08:48----------
so when these two signals are present

---------08:50----------
that's going to allow this

---------08:51----------
to be a voltage divider and that's going

---------08:54----------
to allow this transistor to open because

---------08:55----------
you'll have three or four volts here

---------08:57----------
instead of eight

---------08:57----------
and it will open because the gate will

---------08:59----------
now be lower than the source

---------09:01----------
now what happens if c7782

---------09:04----------
shorts because it gets liquid on it well

---------09:07----------
that means that

---------09:08----------
this and it turns into a wire if the

---------09:10----------
capacitor if that turns into a wire

---------09:12----------
then the gate and the source over here

---------09:14----------
there's going to be

---------09:17----------
no resistance so there's not going to be

---------09:19----------
any ability of a voltage divider because

---------09:21----------
the whole point of a voltage divider the

---------09:22----------
way this is going to work

---------09:24----------
is if i have a 301 k ohm resistor up

---------09:26----------
here and then a 147 kilo ohm resistor

---------09:28----------
down here

---------09:29----------
it's going to send some of my voltage

---------09:30----------
from over here to ground

---------09:33----------
however if i have a wire over here

---------09:35----------
because this cap is dead and turns into

---------09:36----------
a wire

---------09:38----------
then i don't have a 301 kilo ohm

---------09:39----------
resistor anymore you understand because

---------09:41----------
this cap is running in parallel with

---------09:42----------
this resistor so it's not going to be

---------09:44----------
301 kiloohms of resistance between here

---------09:46----------
and here

---------09:47----------
it's going to be zero because this is

---------09:50----------
now a wire

---------09:51----------
that's not a voltage divider circuit you

---------09:52----------
can't have a wire at the top of your

---------09:54----------
voltage divider it doesn't make sense

---------09:55----------
doesn't work

---------09:56----------
because this is going to have the

---------09:57----------
ability to send so much current through

---------09:59----------
to here

---------10:00----------
that even if you're sending a little bit

---------10:02----------
of it to ground with this pathetic

---------10:03----------
little 147 kilo ohm resistor

---------10:05----------
it's not going to send enough the ground

---------10:06----------
to actually lower the voltage because

---------10:08----------
you have a wire from here

---------10:09----------
so i'm going to knock this cap off and

---------10:11----------
get a back light and then i'm going to

---------10:12----------
replace that filter

---------10:14----------
that got broken off and i'm going to get

---------10:16----------
an image but not in that order it's

---------10:18----------
actually the image

---------10:20----------
is you you have to do image first and

---------10:21----------
then you get backlight after

---------10:24----------
so let's go all right that was honestly

---------10:28----------
a really awful explanation i've

---------10:29----------
explained transistors in this very

---------10:30----------
circuit in the past before

---------10:32----------
and i explained it in the document that

---------10:34----------
i made that should be in the link in the

---------10:35----------
video description and i think i did a

---------10:36----------
great job of it

---------10:39----------
i think that i am becoming a worse

---------10:40----------
teacher as the years go on

---------10:43----------
and at some point perhaps someone who is

---------10:45----------
more enthusiastic about this will come

---------10:47----------
along and replace me

---------10:49----------
i think my older videos did a really

---------10:50----------
good job of making this really easy to

---------10:52----------
understand even if you were clueless

---------10:55----------
because i think i had a little bit more

---------10:56----------
natural enthusiasm and i think that

---------10:58----------
enthusiasm is present

---------11:00----------
because i've been doing videos for one

---------11:01----------
year not

---------11:03----------
six or seven or eight years once you

---------11:06----------
have the same explanation every single

---------11:08----------
day for six or seven or eight years

---------11:10----------
it's easy to lose the enthusiasm for it

---------11:14----------
maybe that and when you realize that

---------11:16----------
youtube is showing your videos to

---------11:18----------
1.6 percent of your actual audience but

---------11:21----------
i'm not salty

---------11:25----------
i saw that in eli's comments section in

---------11:27----------
one of his videos earlier

---------11:29----------
and someone said man i'd love you know i

---------11:31----------
loved and he did tech videos i want to

---------11:33----------
watch again if you did tech videos and

---------11:34----------
he's like no don't lie to me

---------11:36----------
no no don't lie to me

---------11:40----------
i have analytics i see what you actually

---------11:42----------
watch i understand what he's doing i

---------11:44----------
understand that he's kind of saying that

---------11:45----------
because

---------11:46----------
part of it is just really being salty

---------11:47----------
and i understand how the youtube

---------11:49----------
system kind of can make you salty after

---------11:51----------
a while

---------11:53----------
i was looking at that the other day i

---------11:55----------
upload a video of mr clinton 550

---------11:57----------
000 views a board repair video 15

---------12:00----------
000.

---------12:04----------
i upload a video of me looking in a

---------12:06----------
refrigerator fifty thousand views

---------12:08----------
border pair 9 000.

---------12:12----------
he has the same issue that i do where

---------12:14----------
people always say

---------12:15----------
why don't you make more educational

---------12:17----------
videos but then when he actually makes

---------12:19----------
them

---------12:20----------
nobody watches them

---------12:27----------
and it really does kind of simmer your

---------12:30----------
um

---------12:32----------
your enthusiasm so to speak and

---------12:39----------
i don't know what my own friends are

---------12:40----------
telling me oh i didn't even know you

---------12:42----------
made a video in the last two weeks he

---------12:43----------
didn't show up my notifications

---------12:45----------
yeah yeah thanks susan

---------12:50----------
thank you susan

---------12:53----------
but uh at the end of the day that's my

---------12:54----------
fault

---------12:56----------
because if i made stuff that people

---------12:58----------
actually found interesting

---------13:00----------
if they would say huh i haven't seen a

---------13:02----------
video for him in a while let me let me

---------13:03----------
check on his page and see what he made

---------13:06----------
at the end of the day the algorithm is

---------13:08----------
really an excuse that a lot of people

---------13:10----------
use for

---------13:10----------
the fact that they don't make stuff

---------13:12----------
that's interesting enough for people to

---------13:13----------
actually want to seek out their page in

---------13:15----------
their content

---------13:16----------
because there are some pages that i

---------13:18----------
there's some people i watch or you know

---------13:19----------
if there's

---------13:20----------
nothing in my feed for a while i'll

---------13:21----------
actually go and check their page just

---------13:22----------
because i'm kind of curious what they're

---------13:23----------
up to

---------13:24----------
okay

---------13:30----------
place that capacitor although i could

---------13:32----------
honestly do this without the capacitor

---------13:36----------
put that capacitor in blaze and the

---------13:46----------
inductor

---------14:06----------
and i think the enthusiasm thing is a

---------14:08----------
big part of why

---------14:09----------
our current education system sucks

---------14:13----------
because i mean you have the power to

---------14:14----------
have lessons

---------14:16----------
via you know video you've had that for a

---------14:17----------
really long time so what you do

---------14:20----------
is you can have the lessons be have the

---------14:22----------
best and the best enthusiastic take

---------14:25----------
where you've gone over everything

---------14:26----------
perfectly

---------14:27----------
and then you give that to everybody and

---------14:29----------
then the showing up would be

---------14:31----------
you know the tutoring so you wouldn't

---------14:32----------
spend 40 minutes

---------14:36----------
you know having someone repeat something

---------14:37----------
to you that they've repeated millions of

---------14:39----------
times before

---------14:40----------
you maybe you'd have someone show you

---------14:43----------
how to do it in a really really good

---------14:45----------
video where you have the best teacher

---------14:46----------
that ever did it

---------14:48----------
get some crazy sum of money to produce

---------14:50----------
the video once not over and over again

---------14:52----------
that gets shown everybody our senses on

---------14:54----------
a macbook board difficult to repair

---------14:58----------
that's kind of like asking how long is a

---------15:00----------
piece of string

---------15:04----------
it's like any other logic board repair

---------15:06----------
but sometimes it's not a logic border

---------15:08----------
pair sometimes it's a trackpad

---------15:09----------
yeah but at the end of the day your

---------15:11----------
question what you just asked me

---------15:12----------
is how long is a piece of string

---------15:17----------
or how many pounds does a thing weigh

---------15:21----------
i have a whole playlist on sensor issues

---------15:23----------
i'm a really really easy summer

---------15:25----------
total nightmare train wrecks

---------15:28----------
don't ask me how long a piece of string

---------15:30----------
is it's really hard to answer

---------15:33----------
yeah what i'm thinking is you could have

---------15:35----------
a teacher that does their best

---------15:37----------
find the best teacher in the world have

---------15:39----------
them do their best enthusiastic take

---------15:40----------
where

---------15:41----------
the highest number of students

---------15:43----------
understand

---------15:44----------
what's going on even if they didn't

---------15:46----------
understand this topic before after they

---------15:47----------
hear this particular lecture

---------15:49----------
save that then when it comes to then

---------15:52----------
you'd have like the six or eight hours a

---------15:53----------
day be the tutoring

---------15:56----------
or the few hours that you show up in

---------15:57----------
person be the tutoring back and forth

---------15:59----------
you get to ask questions interrupt say

---------16:01----------
where you're confused and all that [ __ ]

---------16:05----------
there's so many different ways to

---------16:06----------
organize things but yeah i just try

---------16:08----------
i think it's hysterical that a lecture

---------16:10----------
is something you're not supposed to

---------16:11----------
interrupt where you listen to someone
