---------00:00----------
all right I tried with that other

---------00:01----------
cardioid microphone and yeah my if

---------00:04----------
depending on how my Craigslist ad does I

---------00:06----------
might way end up doing a free giveaway

---------00:07----------
with it it's it's just like I know that

---------00:10----------
cardioid microphones have very specific

---------00:12----------
pickup patterns and if you move your

---------00:13----------
head where it's pointing is different

---------00:15----------
but I have a shure sm58 enough

---------00:18----------
microphone is like $90 it's a cardioid

---------00:20----------
pickup pattern and that the headband is

---------00:23----------
an uncomfortable piece of but let

---------00:25----------
me tell you when you move your head from

---------00:26----------
left right up or down you get the exact

---------00:29----------
same sound because the headband is

---------00:31----------
constantly pointing at the same place

---------00:34----------
the DPA D fine 88 I'm sure it's a great

---------00:38----------
microphone if you stand like this and

---------00:40----------
you don't move at all but like when you

---------00:42----------
move like this that's 10 that the

---------00:44----------
headpiece is so I hate to say it because

---------00:48----------
I love DP again this thing over here

---------00:50----------
this forty 65 this is the I love this DP

---------00:53----------
a forty 65 I'm making it a condition

---------00:55----------
that if Eli the computer guy visits here

---------00:57----------
like he's supposed to in December 10

---------00:59----------
Barok tober for that YouTube thing and

---------01:00----------
he does an interview I'm gonna make him

---------01:02----------
wear one of these you're knocking you

---------01:03----------
don't get to interview me if you're not

---------01:05----------
wearing one of these microphones that's

---------01:06----------
is that is how much I love this thing

---------01:08----------
I'm gonna make a Eli endorse a DPA forty

---------01:10----------
sixty five and wear a grape but but the

---------01:14----------
point is I love their stuff at the build

---------01:16----------
quality that define 88 it's like are you

---------01:19----------
kidding me like if you move from here to

---------01:22----------
here the mic just goes boo boo boo boo I

---------01:24----------
finally thought I got an O position

---------01:26----------
where wasn't moving non-stop and it does

---------01:27----------
now I figured out how to get it to not

---------01:29----------
move non-stop I figured out how to make

---------01:30----------
it actually workable I taped it to my

---------01:32----------
face

---------01:33----------
I'm not kidding you I took this D I took

---------01:35----------
this captain tape and I taped it like I

---------01:37----------
tried with the the clip I tried putting

---------01:39----------
the clip on the wire putting the wire in

---------01:41----------
the back of the shirt but then when you

---------01:42----------
move it like this it's so flimsy that

---------01:44----------
literally the wire moving just makes it

---------01:45----------
move so I took captain tape

---------01:48----------
I took captain tape and I taped it to

---------01:50----------
the side of my face and that's just no I

---------01:52----------
would literally rather give that thing

---------01:54----------
away than have a $500 $600 microphone

---------01:56----------
here that only works properly if I tape

---------01:58----------
it but this thing I mean it looks like a

---------02:00----------
coat hanger don't go in twist this looks

---------02:02----------
like a coat hanger but my god it is

---------02:04----------
durable it is strong it's like I mean I

---------02:06----------
really didn't appreciate the sound of it

---------02:08----------
and I only got that other microphone I

---------02:11----------
only got that other microphone

---------02:13----------
when I thought that this thing was dead

---------02:15----------
I figured I might as well try something

---------02:16----------
new oh I never do that and then this one

---------02:20----------
wound up being fixable you should see

---------02:21----------
how short the cord is on this thing now

---------02:22----------
like it that's the clip to the bottom of

---------02:24----------
my shirt because the cord is so short it

---------02:26----------
won't make its way to the wireless

---------02:27----------
transmitter if I put it in my pocket but

---------02:30----------
man I love my DPA 4065 I have to find

---------02:33----------
more of these I just don't want to pay

---------02:35----------
700 bucks for it so I wait for them to

---------02:36----------
show abused anyway I've been rambling

---------02:39----------
for 2 minutes 2 minutes and 42 seconds

---------02:42----------
about something that has nothing to do

---------02:44----------
with board repair so now that we've

---------02:46----------
scared away all the annoying people that

---------02:48----------
are going Louis I didn't subscribe for

---------02:50----------
this I didn't subscribe for that alright

---------02:53----------
now we can get to some actual board

---------02:57----------
repair let's take a look at this this is

---------03:00----------
a machine that as always has had nothing

---------03:01----------
spilled on it and it's funny this is the

---------03:03----------
first machine of the day where I was

---------03:04----------
telling myself first machine rice it you

---------03:08----------
know what maybe I'm just not gonna work

---------03:09----------
gloves let me just be normal and not

---------03:10----------
wear gloves while I'm fixing something

---------03:12----------
and then the cameras in black and white

---------03:21----------
we got to get you in color so you can

---------03:23----------
see that in all of its glory hey little

---------03:26----------
guy what are you like I don't even know

---------03:40----------
what that is but look anyway so let's

---------03:43----------
get this thing out of the machine and

---------03:45----------
then we are going to get into figuring

---------03:48----------
out what's wrong with it it's definitely

---------03:50----------
not water because they told me it wasn't

---------03:52----------
water and by god they would not say that

---------03:55----------
it wasn't water if it was water so let's

---------04:01----------
open this up we're gonna take the board

---------04:03----------
out and we're gonna see it's gonna be

---------04:05----------
something else it's gonna be it's gonna

---------04:07----------
be spontaneous combustion maybe maybe

---------04:12----------
I'll find the you know a note in there

---------04:13----------
with a board cuz I'm sorry let's just be

---------04:17----------
friends I can't be your computer anymore

---------04:19----------
maybe it decided to stop working on its

---------04:21----------
own we'll see let's see what we get what

---------04:25----------
do you guys think we're gonna see

---------04:28----------
what do you think we're gonna see on the

---------04:30----------
bottom of this

---------04:40----------
holy moly there's a chance that there's

---------04:45----------
no water here unless I'm blind alright

---------04:48----------
let's go through this my god this may be

---------04:51----------
some hope you telling me I had an honest

---------04:54----------
customer whoa whoa stop the presses baby

---------05:00----------
alright let's take a look under the

---------05:02----------
microscope this is this is good this is

---------05:06----------
amazing I was not expecting this one bit

---------05:08----------
alright let's go over and see so he got

---------05:12----------
some a little a little bit of pubes but

---------05:13----------
not not not more pubes than expected to

---------05:16----------
take this is this is actually a very

---------05:18----------
conservative number of pubes got nothing

---------05:22----------
bad to say about the number that I see

---------05:24----------
here let's get this a little bit more in

---------05:25----------
focus for you all okay you're gonna just

---------05:28----------
go up and down up and down up and down

---------05:31----------
remember we always like to look for the

---------05:33----------
obvious hints

---------05:42----------
so close so close man all right so we

---------05:46----------
got something see how everything

---------05:49----------
sticking in this area over here yeah

---------05:55----------
that's some sticky that's that is

---------06:01----------
liquid all right Oh in case any solder

---------06:07----------
joints have broken off that's a really

---------06:09----------
small amount of liquid I got to say and

---------06:12----------
you know what I'm not even gonna say

---------06:14----------
anything mean here I'm not even gonna

---------06:17----------
say anything mean

---------06:28----------
but that's a really small amount of

---------06:29----------
water like even I don't think even I

---------06:33----------
would notice that amount of water

---------06:45----------
I don't think even I would notice that

---------06:47----------
amount of water so let's get right into

---------06:57----------
this little bit of hot air and a little

---------07:03----------
bit of flux or any other joints over

---------07:07----------
here off

---------07:36----------
okay now keep in mind that is the spi

---------07:39----------
ROM chip so

---------07:56----------
so we know it got in around the edge

---------08:01----------
this is irrelevant because it's not near

---------08:04----------
any contact points

---------08:39----------
anything interesting now it looks pretty

---------08:42----------
boring to me pretty boring I'm not

---------08:53----------
seeing anything of note here

---------09:13----------
all right so we might as well to start

---------09:15----------
going through power rails and go from

---------09:18----------
there so let's get the microscope camera

---------09:23----------
out of you and we're just gonna go over

---------09:25----------
some of the panel rails I'm loving this

---------09:34----------
microphone I don't have to care about

---------09:35----------
every time I move my head if it moved up

---------09:37----------
or down or anything like that I was such

---------09:40----------
a pain in the ass you have no idea I'm

---------09:44----------
most likely gonna wind up giving that

---------09:46----------
away for free all right so let's go

---------09:49----------
through with a list of rails this is my

---------09:57----------
multimeter which is always just out of

---------09:58----------
view

---------09:59----------
great filming so the first rail that we

---------10:03----------
want to get is pp bus g3 hot should be

---------10:04----------
twelve point six says twelve point eight

---------10:06----------
in the schematic it's always twelve

---------10:08----------
point five six in real life and twelve

---------10:11----------
point five three close enough next up on

---------10:13----------
the list is going to be pp busts s5a

---------10:17----------
chests other computing which is always

---------10:20----------
there unless there's a resistor that's

---------10:22----------
destroyed which would have showed up so

---------10:24----------
I ignore that P P DC n well if I have

---------10:27----------
the first one in the Chargers working

---------10:29----------
with common sense so we ignore that PP

---------10:31----------
three before two that's showing up

---------10:32----------
because I have a light in the charger so

---------10:34----------
we ignore that P P P RT C G three hot

---------10:36----------
let's check that one out and go through

---------10:45----------
the list and find the rail that's

---------10:46----------
missing and the schematic there's gonna

---------10:49----------
be a list of power rails and what

---------10:52----------
seriously idiot how did you miss this

---------10:55----------
dum-dum how did I miss this how many how

---------10:59----------
many did I'm not sure did I not go over

---------11:01----------
this part of the board or did I go over

---------11:03----------
this part of the board and actually not

---------11:04----------
see it cuz if I actually went over this

---------11:06----------
part of the board I could not did

---------11:08----------
somebody just swap the board in front of

---------11:10----------
me on the desk like was there a gremlin

---------11:11----------
here are you kidding me look at

---------11:13----------
this it's still not only does it still

---------11:14----------
have liquid on top of the chip but this

---------11:15----------
is like red and covered in green pubes

---------11:18----------
and red and oh I'm genuinely curious did

---------11:24----------
I miss that

---------11:25----------
did I miss that

---------11:27----------
did I not go over it in the camera or

---------11:28----------
did I actually go over it in the camera

---------11:29----------
and not see either way that's unfuckin

---------11:32----------
excuse that that's unexcusable idiocy

---------11:34----------
right there but that is what you guys

---------11:37----------
have probably come to expect from this

---------11:38----------
channel by now so we're going to go over

---------11:40----------
the area now this is the clock chip

---------11:45----------
this thing's responsibility is to create

---------11:47----------
sis clock the 32 killer it's our TC

---------11:50----------
signal that goes to the PCH platform

---------11:53----------
controller hub a platform controller hub

---------11:55----------
is kind of like a combination between a

---------11:56----------
Northbridge and Southbridge and on here

---------11:58----------
it's integrated into the CPU so that is

---------12:01----------
creating a clock signal for the CPU now

---------12:04----------
the CPU is going to put out a lot of

---------12:06----------
different signals in this machine that's

---------12:08----------
a you know turn on this power rail so

---------12:10----------
for example PP 5 vs 4 in this computer

---------12:12----------
the CPU is going to tell it turn on the

---------12:15----------
5 volt rail for when you're in an S 4

---------12:16----------
state now it's not gonna do that if the

---------12:19----------
clock isn't on without the clock it's

---------12:20----------
not going to initialize any of that and

---------12:22----------
oh look at this look at this so I'm

---------12:26----------
gonna take the assumption though the cab

---------12:28----------
is obvious I don't even care if it's the

---------12:30----------
cap that's bad but the chip is good or

---------12:32----------
the chip is bad but the cap is good they

---------12:33----------
both got to go I mean look at him look

---------12:37----------
at him disgusting yeah / yuck

---------12:53----------
gross

---------13:40----------
this is bad wicking don't do the wicking

---------13:44----------
the way I just did never you don't

---------13:46----------
remove the wick me don't remove the iron

---------13:48----------
while the wick is still on the board

---------13:49----------
that's a big no-no I'm also using the

---------13:52----------
wrong tip for this but I know what I'm

---------13:56----------
doing which is why I'm allowed to do

---------13:58----------
things that make it look like I don't

---------13:59----------
know what I'm doing that's just me not

---------14:02----------
wanting to buy another bevel tip since

---------14:04----------
the other one got destroyed by us all

---------14:08----------
right so now it's time to solder on a

---------14:12----------
replacement chip which is gonna be so

---------14:15----------
what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna

---------14:16----------
tin each one of those pads we're gonna

---------14:18----------
we're gonna it's gonna look like a nice

---------14:21----------
little landscape nice little landscape

---------14:27----------
little valleys and peaks and valleys and

---------14:30----------
Peaks so build your landscape you're

---------14:36----------
just gonna put a little bit of flux

---------14:41----------
this and now see one pad to pad

---------14:55----------
see this is what I like about this tip

---------14:57----------
you get the elbow for when you want to

---------14:59----------
do wicking and heavy stuff like this

---------15:00----------
then when I want to do one at a time I

---------15:02----------
can use this really fine point that's

---------15:05----------
the T 15 J so2 tip I love it I love it

---------15:11----------
so much that I'm putting up with Heco's

---------15:13----------
warranty procedures on the iron that I

---------15:14----------
have that doesn't work I think some

---------15:21----------
people think I'm paid by these companies

---------15:23----------
to say what I like I'm really not know

---------15:25----------
no company in their right mind whatever

---------15:27----------
sponsored me for any of these types of

---------15:28----------
things because I say what I think about

---------15:31----------
the product sometimes what I think is

---------15:33----------
not something that's going to make the

---------15:36----------
product sound like something that

---------15:37----------
they're gonna sell now I also have this

---------15:41----------
strange feeling that ppv RTC the via

---------15:44----------
going into the board maybe half

---------15:45----------
connected so I'm actually going after I

---------15:48----------
put the capacitor down there I'm gonna

---------15:50----------
run a line from there to somewhere else

---------15:52----------
on the board where ppv RTC is present

---------15:54----------
just to make sure that there's no funny

---------15:58----------
business and that it doesn't disconnect

---------16:02----------
it really does look bad yeah we're just

---------16:04----------
gonna get some side on that Center pad

---------16:06----------
and as usual I got too much solder on

---------16:08----------
the center pad but you'll see how we fix

---------16:09----------
that in a moment

---------16:57----------
well you may notice that when I'm zoomed

---------17:00----------
in more that it goes that it goes in and

---------17:02----------
out of focus a lot easier that's why I

---------17:04----------
usually do all my work at 7x because I

---------17:06----------
don't need a lot of zoom but I do want

---------17:09----------
to not get dizzy I mean it's it's it's

---------17:12----------
cool when you're buying needs to see I

---------17:14----------
can pay a hundred dollars more to get

---------17:16----------
the one that has more zoom but is it

---------17:18----------
cool when it's constantly going out of

---------17:20----------
focus and driving you nuts I would argue

---------17:23----------
not so much anyway let's just

---------17:39----------
okay now let's grab a capacitor

---------18:06----------
let's go shopping for a capacitor

---------18:19----------
I think I got one

---------18:25----------
I like this coat hanger microphone I

---------18:28----------
really do it's the fact that it looks

---------18:32----------
like a coat hanger is I like it even

---------18:33----------
more because people think it's cheap and

---------18:35----------
people like oh my god that's so silly

---------18:37----------
why do you use that and then they want

---------18:39----------
and then you like show me another tech

---------18:41----------
video where somebody is like sure well

---------18:43----------
show me this show me another tech video

---------18:45----------
where they have a 35,000 BTU air

---------18:47----------
conditioner a hot-air station with a

---------18:49----------
powerful pump a fume extractor with the

---------18:52----------
hot air station with the powerful pump

---------18:53----------
where you can hear exactly what they're

---------18:55----------
saying doesn't exist it doesn't

---------18:58----------
exist good luck

---------19:00----------
unless they like did the audio over

---------19:02----------
after they were done with it

---------19:16----------
all right so a few things I want to

---------19:18----------
touch up here I believe I accidentally

---------19:22----------
wikked this resistor that's down here I

---------19:25----------
wick to that and second thing is I said

---------19:27----------
again I don't trust that connection

---------19:29----------
there so I am going to attach a wire

---------19:31----------
from there to another point on the board

---------19:33----------
where ppv RTC underscore g3 hottest

---------19:36----------
present well first things first here

---------19:38----------
let's just get tip in there we go make

---------19:44----------
sure that's nice and connected I almost

---------19:51----------
kind of wanna

---------19:54----------
I don't know if that's making a great

---------19:57----------
connection to the capacitor scrape the

---------20:01----------
solder mask off

---------20:08----------
and the solder directly to the board

---------20:10----------
there

---------20:17----------
there we go nice connection directly to

---------20:19----------
the board now I'm gonna wire that to

---------20:21----------
somewhere else that PPV ARTC underscore

---------20:24----------
g3 hot is present and this is where the

---------20:27----------
board view may come in just a little bit

---------20:28----------
handy so if I do this do this where else

---------20:37----------
do you show up well you show up all the

---------20:39----------
way over there you show up on this

---------20:41----------
connector on pin 40 that's hard to find

---------20:48----------
so why are you down here to one of these

---------20:51----------
three caps

---------20:52----------
yeah that's reasonable I can do that

---------20:55----------
I'll do that so now all I need is a

---------20:58----------
little bit of fine wire again I may not

---------21:03----------
need to do that this is just one of

---------21:04----------
those things that I was talking about

---------21:05----------
and a few videos ago on you know you

---------21:08----------
don't really want people to come back

---------21:09----------
with the exact same problem they had

---------21:11----------
before and one of the ways you keep that

---------21:13----------
from happening is by touching up all

---------21:15----------
these little things and anticipating

---------21:16----------
what's going to go wrong before it

---------21:19----------
actually goes wrong

---------21:28----------
and I want to anticipate what goes wrong

---------21:30----------
before it goes wrong

---------21:32----------
speaking of anticipating things going

---------21:34----------
wrong the short wire on this microphone

---------21:37----------
I must say is starting to drive me nuts

---------21:38----------
trying to clip the thing to a belt loop

---------21:41----------
because I can't it won't make it to my

---------21:43----------
pocket and a little belt the Clippy

---------21:45----------
thing came off so here we go we're all

---------21:52----------
clipped on so now what I can do is I can

---------21:55----------
go over to that area with those three

---------21:57----------
there's three vertical capacitors let's

---------22:00----------
just find that section of the

---------22:01----------
motherboard looks like this alright so I

---------22:06----------
can just attach wire from there

---------22:15----------
there we go and hopefully from there it

---------22:19----------
attaches to the CPU and everywhere else

---------22:20----------
on the board that's that's my hope is

---------22:22----------
that if my path is broken that and that

---------22:25----------
I can just I can recreate it like this

---------22:28----------
if so let's say my path you know let's

---------22:32----------
say it goes to the CPU and then it goes

---------22:34----------
here if I attack it through through here

---------22:38----------
so let's say but let's say this goes to

---------22:41----------
the CPU and that path is broken and then

---------22:44----------
from the CPU it goes I guess actually

---------22:46----------
you know that would that would still

---------22:47----------
work yeah well we'll see look let's not

---------22:51----------
Nunchuk and the idea before we we go for

---------22:55----------
it

---------22:55----------
so let's attach to here let's get my

---------23:02----------
little wire keep in mind you don't need

---------23:05----------
you dryer for this and if I was

---------23:06----------
attaching let's say wires for the DC in

---------23:08----------
rail that's gonna be powering the entire

---------23:10----------
computer plus powering the charger yeah

---------23:13----------
I'd have to think about using a really

---------23:14----------
thick wire here I'm using a thin one

---------23:16----------
because we're dealing with very small

---------23:17----------
components so it's gonna be easier to

---------23:19----------
work with but the primary thing primary

---------23:21----------
thing here is that it's also for you

---------23:26----------
know it's a 3 volt line that's not gonna

---------23:28----------
have a lot of power of you going through

---------23:31----------
it so I don't really particularly need

---------23:35----------
to care

---------23:43----------
okay Sutter now let's take a journey to

---------23:47----------
the other side of the motherboard and

---------23:56----------
these tweezers suck these tweezers are a

---------24:00----------
joke

---------24:00----------
why don't I gotta get some new set

---------24:01----------
alright see these two pieces are a bit

---------24:06----------
equal if not bigger joke

---------24:14----------
right

---------24:30----------
okay scrape scrape scrape now it's not

---------24:37----------
great

---------24:37----------
I just wanted to scrape the scrape bowl

---------24:41----------
over the the insulation off the wire so

---------24:44----------
that I could properly solder to it now I

---------24:47----------
can actually do the job of making a nice

---------24:51----------
joint there so I added some flux I

---------24:53----------
scraped away the board

---------25:36----------
yeah it's good okay so now I can break

---------25:39----------
off this wire

---------25:47----------
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful

---------25:51----------
and now you can plug it in and see if it

---------25:54----------
blows up blows up I'm fired all right so

---------26:03----------
take the MagSafe plug you in and Oh lame

---------26:16----------
hmm still dead I was at least creating

---------26:28----------
ppv RTC g3 huh

---------26:31----------
it would suck if the CPU actually got

---------26:33----------
killed because there it sent a spike to

---------26:36----------
it that's the thing with these CPUs they

---------26:39----------
said complete all the Haswell

---------26:42----------
series CPUs as well as a big same

---------26:45----------
with broad well those are early quarter

---------26:49----------
duo's they could take spikes of 12 volts

---------26:51----------
and be fine yeah so it is there sorry

---------26:56----------
all right well let's just continue down

---------27:00----------
the power rails anyway this may wind up

---------27:02----------
getting fixed by the ultrasonic that

---------27:04----------
could be something hiding under the CPU

---------27:05----------
but I have a feeling that at first let's

---------27:08----------
just go over what creates ppv RTC g3 OTT

---------27:10----------
let's go over this for a minute

---------27:20----------
all right so PPV RTC is used to pull up

---------27:24----------
some of these signals like intruder

---------27:27----------
inter vermin s RTC reset RTC reset so

---------27:31----------
you should always check over there to

---------27:32----------
make sure these are being pulled up

---------27:33----------
sometimes these capacitors can be dead

---------27:34----------
and shorting it to ground sometimes the

---------27:36----------
resistors can be screwed up so PPP RTC

---------27:39----------
is used for that it also pulls up this D

---------27:42----------
SWV arm and signal and this over here

---------27:50----------
this creates ppv RTC g3 hot as well as

---------27:55----------
the clock for some other areas another

---------27:57----------
thing is this is powered off of pp3 v4

---------28:00----------
to undersquare g3

---------28:01----------
hot and P P 3 V 3 is 5 so let's say

---------28:03----------
there was water and there was Ripple

---------28:04----------
let's say you know on the P P 3 V 4 2

---------28:08----------
rail there was a spike of 12 volts or a

---------28:11----------
spike of 16 volt since 12 or 16 volts it

---------28:13----------
will create PP three before two so let's

---------28:15----------
say P P 3 before - for a minute just

---------28:17----------
decided to go to 16 volts so the circuit

---------28:19----------
that creates PP 3 V 4 - is gonna be yeah

---------28:22----------
show you how this works

---------28:24----------
gamma yeah this a 3 point 42 volt supply

---------28:30----------
so 3.40 2 volts is on output and on

---------28:33----------
input you have you follow back the

---------28:37----------
direct DC in charger line which is 18

---------28:40----------
volt so if if there's a quick bit of you

---------28:44----------
know this if there's a quick spike on

---------28:45----------
that not only is it going to kill this

---------28:47----------
chip it's also going to kill the PCH

---------28:50----------
which is attached to it because ppv RTC

---------28:52----------
g3 hot it is gonna go up and this goes

---------28:57----------
directly to the CPU and PCH on this

---------28:59----------
board so this chip is powered by three

---------29:02----------
point 42 volts and it creates 3.3 if

---------29:04----------
this chip powered by 3.2 42 creates 3.3

---------29:08----------
what if this chip for a quick moment is

---------29:10----------
powered by 16 volts then ppv RTC is and

---------29:13----------
you see where that just kind of screws

---------29:15----------
screws everything up so now it's stuck

---------29:20----------
come on be fixable be fixable all right

---------29:23----------
well let's just go through the power

---------29:25----------
rails and see what's missing and see if

---------29:27----------
if we're completely screwed so the next

---------29:29----------
one is pp 5vs5 so we're going to check

---------29:32----------
pp 5vs5

---------29:49----------
kind of like the other microphone better

---------29:51----------
now when I had the other microphone the

---------29:54----------
boys I fixed actually worked

---------29:56----------
alright so PP 5vs5

---------29:59----------
is five point one four volts which is

---------30:02----------
good

---------30:04----------
okay next rail on the list is pp 5 v s4

---------30:09----------
and that's the one that's probably gonna

---------30:12----------
be missing like always so we check for

---------30:15----------
PP 5 vs 4 and PP 5 vs 4 is whoa PP 5 vs

---------30:23----------
4 is 5 volts interesting and it's on oh

---------30:28----------
it is actually on it the fan came

---------30:30----------
unplugged whoa

---------30:46----------
oh you idiot

---------30:55----------
no no other way other way do this idiot

---------31:01----------
anyway fixed that's pretty cool I'm

---------31:06----------
liking this mic again it's mic is my

---------31:07----------
good luck Mike

---------31:08----------
fits my character yeah that's my wire

---------31:14----------
you're not gonna see that because the

---------31:16----------
camera is set to focus on my face

---------31:18----------
but I can always turn that off so you

---------31:21----------
can see what it looks like in context so

---------31:23----------
let's turn on auto and then turn off

---------31:27----------
face focus and

---------31:41----------
beautiful isn't it absolutely beautiful

---------31:46----------
this is a pretty pretty motherboard I

---------31:49----------
know it is a beautiful motherboard let's

---------31:53----------
see how much is and that's it for today

---------31:56----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------32:00----------
something
