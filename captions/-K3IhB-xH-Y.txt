---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:02----------
we're going to get started on an a1707

---------00:04----------
that's not charging

---------00:05----------
first thing we're going to do before we

---------00:06----------
get started on this machine is remove

---------00:08----------
the coronavirus from it

---------00:10----------
through alcohol die corona die

---------00:14----------
die die

---------00:17----------
this macbook is going to have its corona

---------00:19----------
removed

---------00:21----------
okay let's open this macbook up and see

---------00:24----------
if we can figure out what's wrong with

---------00:26----------
it

---------00:26----------
and make it work again

---------00:34----------
nasty dusty dusty

---------00:38----------
okay so when i take a look at this

---------00:43----------
macbook the first thing i notice

---------00:46----------
it gives me the battery indicator so it

---------00:48----------
has the capability to make an image

---------00:50----------
but i just don't think it's charging the

---------00:51----------
battery let's see if that's the case

---------00:54----------
see how we can solve it see if we can

---------00:56----------
make this work again

---------00:58----------
make this into a happy happy macbook

---------01:10----------
all right let's unplug this

---------01:20----------
lewis helptronics fixed with cd 32-15

---------01:22----------
and steve bought another smash macbook

---------01:25----------
i don't remember helping tronics fix

---------01:28----------
i've heard of his channel

---------01:30----------
he's the guy that does a lot of the

---------01:31----------
playstations and switches and all that

---------01:33----------
and he's commented on one of my videos

---------01:35----------
but outside of that i don't have a

---------01:36----------
relationship with him can you

---------01:39----------
perhaps something's mistaken here

---------01:41----------
petition for cope has to stop donating a

---------01:42----------
salary

---------01:43----------
yes please james you've given me enough

---------01:46----------
money

---------01:47----------
stop that and kopez

---------02:02----------
oh i did comment whoops

---------02:06----------
what video uh can you link me to the

---------02:08----------
video here

---------02:10----------
if it won't let you post the url can you

---------02:12----------
just put the last few numbers of the url

---------02:14----------
like the you know the youtube video id

---------02:15----------
or whatever

---------02:24----------
i'm curious

---------02:34----------
seems like a nice enough guy he's

---------02:37----------
getting

---------02:38----------
what's cool about what tronix fix is

---------02:39----------
doing is he's getting normal everyday

---------02:42----------
people to find

---------02:43----------
detective repair work fun and worth

---------02:45----------
doing

---------02:46----------
that's the real right to repair the real

---------02:48----------
right to repair is getting people to

---------02:49----------
find what we do

---------02:50----------
fun entertaining worthwhile

---------03:02----------
engaging

---------03:11----------
ew there's a lot of hair inside this

---------03:13----------
machine

---------03:17----------
why is there so much hair inside this

---------03:19----------
computer

---------03:28----------
all right that's

---------03:37----------
all right so here we got the board

---------03:56----------
okay so what's the first thing we

---------03:58----------
usually check if we got a machine that's

---------04:00----------
not charging

---------04:01----------
well that's a great question so the

---------04:03----------
first thing i'm going to do

---------04:04----------
is plug this in and see what it's taking

---------04:06----------
on my usbc amp meter

---------04:12----------
5 volts 27 milliamps and then it turns

---------04:15----------
off

---------04:27----------
22 milliamps 5 volts it's stuck

---------04:31----------
the first thing i like to do is look

---------04:32----------
around the board and see if there's any

---------04:34----------
corrosion because corrosion is going to

---------04:36----------
be something

---------04:37----------
that gives me a very plain immediate

---------04:40----------
obvious idea of what i should spend my

---------04:44----------
time

---------04:44----------
and focus on so let's switch over to the

---------04:47----------
microscope camera

---------04:48----------
and see what's going on on this macbook

---------04:54----------
ready

---------05:00----------
well then here we have a cd3215 chip

---------05:05----------
first thing we're going to do before we

---------05:07----------
get fully started

---------05:08----------
is unplug unscrew this

---------05:13----------
charge port over here because i don't

---------05:14----------
want to actually melt it off of the

---------05:15----------
board with heat

---------05:17----------
i'm just going to unscrew that here

---------05:21----------
now we may have to replace the chip but

---------05:23----------
i'm going to make a bet that we may be

---------05:25----------
able to make this work again with

---------05:26----------
nothing other than a simple reflow

---------05:28----------
using some beautiful amtec flux

---------05:32----------
some beautiful beautiful amtec flux

---------05:48----------
i don't have a stencil for a cd 30-15

---------05:50----------
here i think the other people here do

---------05:52----------
but i don't i don't have a stencil here

---------05:55----------
for that

---------05:59----------
so we're going to use the proper amount

---------06:00----------
of flux james are you watching

---------06:03----------
i just want to make sure if you're

---------06:04----------
getting into the craft that you're using

---------06:05----------
the proper amount of flux

---------06:11----------
yes yes

---------06:49----------
now you see how the picture's kind of

---------06:50----------
dark even though the exposure is all the

---------06:53----------
way up by tomorrow

---------06:55----------
i'm gonna have that new microscope light

---------06:56----------
here

---------06:58----------
i'm excited for that new microscope

---------07:00----------
light 150 watt microscope

---------07:02----------
light that's going to be sweet

---------07:05----------
i'm really curious to see what the image

---------07:06----------
is like when i can lower the iso and the

---------07:08----------
exposure on the camera

---------07:11----------
it's going to be a sweet sweet picture

---------07:33----------
[Music]

---------07:42----------
so

---------08:03----------
now we're going to give the board a

---------08:04----------
moment to cool using rapid cool

---------08:10----------
technology

---------08:13----------
rapidly cool all right let's see if this

---------08:17----------
works

---------08:24----------
oh you pisa

---------08:35----------
let's see 5 volts 80 milliamps

---------08:39----------
so we have some minor change but it's

---------08:41----------
still not solved

---------08:42----------
oh wait it is 19 volts 20 milliamps come

---------08:45----------
on give me an amp

---------08:46----------
give me an amp give me an amp

---------08:51----------
amp oh 800 milliamps is not an

---------08:54----------
amp

---------08:57----------
come on

---------09:15----------
870 milliamps is close to an amp

---------09:19----------
let's see if it boots now

---------09:24----------
so let's see if we get a picture here

---------09:26----------
and if we do

---------09:27----------
this machine will go to the off to the

---------09:29----------
ultrasonic cleaner and then it'll be

---------09:30----------
good to go

---------09:35----------
it'll be a macbook so i've noticed if i

---------09:37----------
keep my desk perfectly clean over here

---------09:40----------
i can i don't have to worry about

---------09:42----------
getting flux or anything on my mat

---------09:45----------
i can just keep the desk clean and free

---------09:48----------
of debris

---------09:53----------
there's dog hair inside the screen

---------09:55----------
connector here

---------10:00----------
show me picture

---------10:05----------
show me sign of life

---------10:08----------
come on little macbook

---------10:15----------
come on little macbook

---------10:36----------
okay low battery

---------10:41----------
it wants to see the battery before it

---------10:42----------
turns on

---------10:44----------
it's being a [ __ ] fine

---------10:49----------
flying we'll plug your battery in you

---------10:50----------
little

---------10:52----------
mofo

---------10:57----------
do i need to slide the board over a

---------10:58----------
little

---------11:01----------
i think i do

---------11:11----------
say uh

---------11:15----------
feel like a freaking dentist

---------11:20----------
say uh

---------11:28----------
these charge ports are annoying how

---------11:29----------
easily they come off

---------11:33----------
1.2 amps let's see what we get

---------11:37----------
all right so it's taking 2.8 amps which

---------11:40----------
i imagine means that it's charging

---------11:43----------
the battery is now plugged in

---------11:46----------
and it does say here on my usbc amp

---------11:49----------
meter

---------11:55----------
2 0.9 amps

---------12:01----------
trying to keep that damn cable from

---------12:02----------
running away

---------12:04----------
see 2.9 amps

---------12:09----------
so it is charging the battery the

---------12:10----------
numbers before was complaining about the

---------12:11----------
battery not being charged

---------12:14----------
now we need to plug the power cable in

---------12:17----------
so that i can tell to turn on

---------12:20----------
yep turn on you piece of [ __ ]

---------12:24----------
let's try this again all right the

---------12:27----------
battery is totally dead so it's probably

---------12:29----------
going to be a little bit before it turns

---------12:30----------
on

---------12:31----------
this is where i decide to see how the

---------12:33----------
camera mounting outside is going and

---------12:34----------
also perhaps

---------12:36----------
treat myself to a burrito

---------12:49----------
yeah keep complaining about the battery

---------12:51----------
piece of [ __ ]

---------12:53----------
i want you to think about that you could

---------12:54----------
have a pc that's at one percent battery

---------12:56----------
you plug it in you could turn it on

---------12:58----------
macbook dead battery can't turn it on

---------13:05----------
so why are you only charging at one amp

---------13:10----------
let's try a charge port on the other

---------13:11----------
side that was not corroded

---------13:30----------
i'm gonna take a look at what's going on

---------13:32----------
outside

---------13:45----------
oh wait look there's an apple logo

---------13:48----------
it's starting so that's about it uh it's

---------13:51----------
charging

---------13:52----------
well all we did is we reflowed the chip

---------13:54----------
responsible for

---------13:55----------
charging we're going to ultrasonic to

---------13:57----------
board and that should be it

---------13:59----------
unfortunately i have to attend to a very

---------14:00----------
unpleasant business matter so i will be

---------14:02----------
on later

---------14:03----------
i'll see you all in the next video
