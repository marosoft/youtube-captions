---------00:11----------
you

---------00:20----------
you

---------00:40----------
all right back mmm

---------00:59----------
so c7 371 so this is a capacitor on P P

---------01:13----------
bus g3 hot to ground right around the

---------01:17----------
CPU buck converter which is going to

---------01:18----------
take eight point six volts and turn it

---------01:21----------
into about 1.8 volts for the CPU so

---------01:24----------
let's get that thing off and out of here

---------01:28----------
so thank you for the person that left

---------01:31----------
the nice comment before I hit stop

---------01:33----------
streaming Tony appreciate the five

---------01:36----------
pounds okay so I forget if it was this

---------01:41----------
one or this one I'm in it let's see I

---------01:44----------
suppose I can just put a little bit of

---------01:46----------
alcohol should be obvious from touching

---------01:54----------
them which one it is but it's not maybe

---------01:56----------
the glove is doing that maybe just a

---------02:01----------
little bit more alcohol it's really hard

---------02:11----------
to tell on this short honestly look is

---------02:13----------
it the one alright nevermind it's the

---------02:15----------
one on the left it's the one on the left

---------02:16----------
the left is is that fault here do not

---------02:24----------
waste too much

---------02:28----------
all right

---------02:39----------
you may say that you could tell because

---------02:40----------
there's solder balls coming out of it

---------02:42----------
but there's also solder balls by the

---------02:43----------
right one what's the best way to get

---------02:46----------
started doing this now the best way to

---------02:49----------
start is to begin I know that sounds

---------02:52----------
like trolling but no really just find

---------02:55----------
something broken watched all the stuff

---------02:58----------
here and get started and you may find it

---------03:01----------
funny you may hate it but one way to get

---------03:03----------
started is to begin

---------03:47----------
nice and wycked

---------03:57----------
this is completely the wrong side of an

---------03:59----------
iron tip for this but I don't feel like

---------04:01----------
replacing it will make this one work

---------04:10----------
fine that's beautiful that's fine that's

---------04:14----------
fine

---------04:15----------
then you get a capacitor

---------04:28----------
mm-hmm

---------04:41----------
I'll be damned settle my camera finally

---------04:44----------
did me some good

---------05:23----------
whoops that was done

---------05:30----------
that was really dumb

---------05:33----------
alright redo redo

---------05:43----------
push it down wait for it to dry

---------05:53----------
and maybe just to be nice will dry off

---------05:55----------
the rest of the board that I poured

---------05:57----------
alcohol and we also got to replace that

---------06:02----------
fuse remember that we did have a fuse

---------06:04----------
that blew due to the short circuit yes

---------06:08----------
I'm just from far away I'll just try and

---------06:12----------
get rid of all this alcohol did you see

---------06:14----------
that Chris long became a dad yesterday I

---------06:16----------
didn't congratulations to Chris long

---------06:20----------
good stuff

---------06:26----------
smart people reproducing I approve great

---------06:31----------
stuff

---------06:32----------
Chris long is a good person I'm sure

---------06:34----------
he's gonna make an excellent father

---------06:37----------
[Music]

---------06:54----------
okay

---------06:58----------
I'm going after this bad fuse

---------07:05----------
smash the like button guys as Apple I

---------07:08----------
don't have it in me to say that smash up

---------07:13----------
the likes folks smash up the likes while

---------07:15----------
I share a bunch of crypto currencies

---------07:18----------
that I purchased before doing this video

---------07:20----------
and recommending them to you smash up

---------07:23----------
the likes smash up though no that's not

---------07:27----------
something I can say with a straight face

---------07:39----------
right II I can't do accents today

---------07:55----------
[Music]

---------08:00----------
okay yeah it's gonna nice new fuse in

---------08:09----------
there

---------08:17----------
you solder with or without built-in flux

---------08:19----------
it has built-in flex you can see the

---------08:22----------
solder I use in a link in the

---------08:24----------
description below

---------08:35----------
yeah I suck at accents today

---------09:46----------
ah my f key is stuck

---------09:58----------
uh-oh I think I got alcohol into my

---------10:00----------
keyboard

---------10:27----------
huh

---------10:35----------
yep I definitely destroyed my keyboard

---------10:39----------
whoops oh well I got to dry that thing

---------10:45----------
out later

---------10:53----------
all right so we'll let this dry out for

---------10:55----------
a moment

---------11:00----------
I like this new YouTube glitch where the

---------11:02----------
chat just stops working for random

---------11:04----------
periods of time great stuff let's see

---------11:18----------
what did I miss the last one that was

---------11:20----------
visible with 636

---------11:37----------
all right so before we turn this back on

---------11:39----------
I'm gonna go use some compressed air on

---------11:42----------
my keyboard because I would like to be

---------11:44----------
able to have a working keyboard for the

---------11:46----------
rest of the stream maybe that'll fix my

---------11:49----------
problem

---------12:28----------
it has a red light that flickers on it

---------12:30----------
now let's see yep I definitely destroyed

---------12:39----------
it fell rest in peace

---------13:00----------
alright so I'm probably gonna end this

---------13:02----------
dream after this since I don't have a

---------13:04----------
keyboard and that kind of really hampers

---------13:07----------
the ability to do anything so I'm gonna

---------13:10----------
put the power supply back up I manually

---------13:13----------
click on to this mic above the desk

---------13:17----------
camera here's the board put the voltage

---------13:25----------
in my power supply back up to 18 and

---------13:32----------
plug this in you can see fans spin fan

---------13:39----------
spin which means we are good except for

---------13:44----------
the fact that there's no keyboard

---------13:46----------
oh so lame that is that so I am gonna be

---------13:56----------
getting out of here and as always I hope

---------13:59----------
you learned something
