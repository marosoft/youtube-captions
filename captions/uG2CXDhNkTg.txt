---------00:00----------
up next is an a 1286 machine that's not

---------00:02----------
seeing the USB ports we're gonna try to

---------00:04----------
figure out why this machine is not

---------00:06----------
seeing the USB ports see if we can make

---------00:08----------
it work see that this is the mark of the

---------00:11----------
beast' that means it's either a 2011 or

---------00:13----------
2012 if it's a 2011 the GPU will be dead

---------00:17----------
by the time I'm done fixing the USB

---------00:19----------
ports if it's a 2012 there's a chance a

---------00:22----------
small teeny tiny chance that this may

---------00:25----------
not be a waste of time but there's only

---------00:27----------
one way to find out

---------00:28----------
so we're can open this thing up and see

---------00:31----------
if it's a waste and then we're going to

---------00:33----------
plug in a nice little USB Drive and see

---------00:36----------
if it sees it

---------00:36----------
you dropped a screw between your

---------00:38----------
keyboard and your mat that's a good eyes

---------00:41----------
man you're kind of making me wonder if I

---------00:44----------
really should get a 4k overhead camera

---------00:46----------
after all a little piece of crap $400

---------00:49----------
camera seems to be doing just fine if

---------00:50----------
you could see my screw-ups to that well

---------00:53----------
can you imagine how many more of my

---------00:55----------
screw-ups you'll be able to see if I get

---------00:56----------
a higher quality camera cuz how much of

---------00:58----------
it is masked right now through the

---------01:00----------
low-quality Ness of it so this is

---------01:02----------
luckily the 2012 model meaning if I fix

---------01:05----------
the issue with the USB I'm not going to

---------01:07----------
have a dead GPU one day later which is

---------01:10----------
somewhat reassuring so the first thing

---------01:12----------
we have to do here is find something

---------01:14----------
that's USB that I could plug in that

---------01:16----------
will make an easy test subject see ad

---------01:21----------
says if US tells people that you can't

---------01:23----------
say Merry Christmas Christmas Sweden

---------01:25----------
will do the exact same it says mobile

---------01:27----------
fix I don't know I think I'm allowed to

---------01:31----------
say Merry Christmas I had a Christmas

---------01:32----------
tree up next year I had a Christmas tree

---------01:34----------
up last year I think that the issue with

---------01:36----------
a lot of these this social issue is

---------01:38----------
that there's like a very small minority

---------01:39----------
of people that do the loudest screaming

---------01:42----------
and then it brings out all the lunatics

---------01:44----------
on both sides and like 99% of the people

---------01:46----------
that you meet when you actually go

---------01:47----------
outside and shake people's hands and

---------01:48----------
talk to them or share a machine at the

---------01:50----------
gym they don't care about any of this

---------01:53----------
stuff they really don't it's not that

---------01:54----------
important somebody says happy holidays

---------01:56----------
and Merry Christmas 99% of the people

---------01:58----------
don't care I have a Christmas tree I'm

---------02:02----------
not Christian but I have a Christmas

---------02:03----------
tree I like Christmas music I say Merry

---------02:05----------
Christmas I put up a Christmas tree

---------02:06----------
nobody cares it's just like you know

---------02:09----------
you're watching too much YouTube you

---------02:11----------
guys are watching too much YouTube

---------02:13----------
go outside there's an entire world out

---------02:19----------
there of people that don't make their

---------02:21----------
living off of making you think the world

---------02:23----------
is worse than it actually is

---------02:24----------
all right so first thing we're gonna do

---------02:26----------
is turn this thing on and see if it sees

---------02:28----------
my USB Drive the problem stems from the

---------02:30----------
loud night from the 99% now Helen

---------02:33----------
allowed 1% to STFU again yeah if you're

---------02:36----------
the person that's like camping outside

---------02:38----------
of Starbucks to say how dare you say

---------02:40----------
happy holidays instead of Merry

---------02:42----------
Christmas or you're the douchebag saying

---------02:45----------
how dare that business say Happy

---------02:47----------
Holidays Merry Christmas instead of

---------02:49----------
speaking about the religions of the

---------02:51----------
oppressed

---------02:51----------
if you're either one of those people

---------02:53----------
that are camping outside of stores going

---------02:55----------
on about this you are in that very

---------02:56----------
minority 1% that just live to make

---------02:59----------
society worse and like again it's not

---------03:02----------
just go outside go to the gym go to the

---------03:04----------
park go to a bookstore talk to some real

---------03:06----------
actual human beings that they have much

---------03:09----------
more important things to give a

---------03:11----------
about than that but anyway as you can

---------03:13----------
see we have confirmed that we don't have

---------03:16----------
this you you usb-drive showing up so it

---------03:20----------
clearly does not see my test OS so we've

---------03:23----------
got a few things here that we have to

---------03:24----------
figure out there's two possibilities for

---------03:27----------
us not having USB it could be either a

---------03:29----------
power problem or a data problem it's

---------03:31----------
supposed to be sending five volts to the

---------03:34----------
USB port if we have five volts then it

---------03:36----------
could be a data problem because there's

---------03:37----------
going to be a MUX typically where the

---------03:40----------
USB port can actually use the talk

---------03:41----------
directly to the SMC or it can be used to

---------03:45----------
talk to the PC agent and the CPU and

---------03:46----------
that could be malfunctioning in which

---------03:48----------
case we're not getting our USB or it

---------03:51----------
could be some sort of issue with the

---------03:52----------
actual USB controller chip if this is

---------03:54----------
one of the newer the older machines that

---------03:56----------
didn't yet integrate the USB C hub into

---------03:59----------
the CPU newer machines the USB signal

---------04:02----------
just goes straight to the CPU it's all

---------04:04----------
in there on some of the older machines

---------04:05----------
it goes through a USB see a USB that USB

---------04:08----------
see a USB hub before it makes its way

---------04:10----------
over to the PCH and then the CPU so what

---------04:14----------
I want to do here is firstly I'm going

---------04:16----------
to unplug the sleep sensor because I

---------04:19----------
want this machine to stay on when I

---------04:21----------
close it to make my measurements and I

---------04:23----------
have my USB thing plugged in we're going

---------04:25----------
to bring up a schematic here for the

---------04:26----------
eight to zero

---------04:27----------
three three three zero board and go from

---------04:30----------
there so here we have a USB port so

---------04:33----------
let's check on the desk camera and see

---------04:35----------
if we have five volts going to the US be

---------04:37----------
loving this this this little stream deck

---------04:40----------
thing is awesome by the way once you get

---------04:43----------
one you never want to go back okay so do

---------04:50----------
we have five volts we don't now that's

---------04:54----------
actually a good thing because I would

---------04:55----------
rather have a power problem than a data

---------04:57----------
problem a data problem can be a bit of a

---------05:00----------
nightmare because there's multiple

---------05:01----------
things that could be at fault so if we

---------05:03----------
go over to the schematic just by itself

---------05:06----------
let's just do the schematic by itself

---------05:08----------
god I'm loving this little button this

---------05:10----------
is so awesome it could be the SMC debug

---------05:12----------
MUX that's bad it could be the inductors

---------05:15----------
in the for the data signal filtering out

---------05:19----------
high frequency crap that are bad it

---------05:21----------
could be any one of a number of things

---------05:25----------
so it could be let's go back to the

---------05:27----------
board view as well so never it's most

---------05:29----------
likely not the inductors fault because

---------05:31----------
we have the same voltage on each side of

---------05:33----------
the inductor when I previously measured

---------05:34----------
so we're gonna take a look at you forty

---------05:36----------
six hundred and see what it looks like

---------05:37----------
on my board so that's you forty six

---------05:39----------
hundred right there it looks pretty fun

---------05:43----------
to me it doesn't look like there's

---------05:45----------
anything wrong with it but just because

---------05:47----------
it doesn't look like there's something

---------05:48----------
wrong with it doesn't mean that's not a

---------05:50----------
reason to cover it in flux and replace

---------05:53----------
it with a new one Paul we're gonna cover

---------05:55----------
that in flux

---------05:56----------
yes yes yes all it is needed is one ball

---------06:06----------
of flux one tetra pole

---------08:04----------
you

---------08:10----------
so that port works now let's see if this

---------08:13----------
port works

---------08:24----------
they seem to have one working port so it

---------08:27----------
appears me now I do have five volts at

---------08:29----------
that USB port okay we did have five

---------08:37----------
volts at that USB port five volts on

---------08:40----------
this side of the inductor five volts on

---------08:43----------
this side of the inductor so five volts

---------08:46----------
is making its way over to that port so

---------08:49----------
why is it that one port is working but

---------08:52----------
the other is not hmm now this would

---------08:57----------
usually be a problem for Paul to solve

---------08:59----------
but we've stopped doing that Paul

---------09:01----------
deserves some easy stuff so let's go

---------09:04----------
back over to the schematic in the board

---------09:05----------
view and take a look look and see what's

---------09:11----------
did it what the difference is between

---------09:12----------
these two ports so the port that's

---------09:13----------
closer to the bottom of the board with

---------09:15----------
the battery is is the one that's not

---------09:16----------
working it's J 4600 so what is the

---------09:19----------
difference between J 4,600 and J 46:40

---------09:23----------
4700 all right so check it out J 4700

---------09:26----------
this is the working port now on the

---------09:29----------
working port that is having no problem

---------09:31----------
on this port it isn't working even

---------09:35----------
though it's getting voltage and the only

---------09:36----------
difference I can see between these two

---------09:38----------
is that this one has this stupid MUX

---------09:40----------
chip let's find you 46 50 and see if by

---------09:43----------
replacing this chip if our board will

---------09:45----------
work again so we've gotten somewhere we

---------09:48----------
got from having zero ports now we have

---------09:51----------
one port but one port is probably not

---------09:53----------
enough for Lewis to make money in order

---------09:56----------
for me to be able to charge money for

---------09:57----------
this I need both ports to work so we're

---------10:03----------
going to take that little debug MUX

---------10:05----------
and replace it where is that okay you're

---------10:12----------
over here that's you

---------10:15----------
so let's unplug the power before we get

---------10:17----------
started let's get that MUX chip out of

---------10:20----------
here

---------10:32----------
2012

---------10:36----------
I'm not doing this a bit there was a

---------10:38----------
chance to do as a GPU now one of those

---------10:42----------
pads under there it looks like it's seen

---------10:43----------
better days yeah

---------11:19----------
let's get rid of all the lead free

---------11:23----------
beautiful

---------13:22----------
see if we have recognition and it seems

---------13:30----------
like it still does not see the USB port

---------13:33----------
but if I plug it into the USB port below

---------13:43----------
instant recognition but if I plug it

---------13:46----------
into this USB port no recognition still

---------13:53----------
dead all right so what else could be

---------13:56----------
wrong with the second USB port this

---------13:59----------
needs to be as high as riffraff so over

---------14:03----------
here I'm expecting this to be three

---------14:04----------
volts diamonds Oh like presents like

---------14:08----------
give him as a gift

---------14:11----------
riff-raff is the best he's a bastion of

---------14:15----------
talent I'll check that in a second Adam

---------14:21----------
here first they need to confirm that

---------14:23----------
this thing is not stuck in debug mode

---------14:34----------
so that's 3.43 volts which means it is

---------14:37----------
it is being told to work as a USB port

---------14:41----------
now let's replace the filters in the

---------14:43----------
line see if that does anything

---------14:51----------
Green medicine green mojo

---------15:19----------
doesn't say the answer and sober

---------15:27----------
yes SNA

---------15:30----------
snag

---------15:56----------
you're going all out on this USB line

---------15:59----------
the diode the filter so we replace to

---------16:12----------
you at the in this round we were playing

---------16:14----------
I replaced the USB to data line filter

---------16:16----------
USB three data line filter and I this

---------16:19----------
little diode to ground the case

---------16:21----------
something gets plugged in the wrong way

---------16:41----------
mr. sorry ten whispers

---------16:54----------
okay

---------17:08----------
okay last try if this doesn't work they

---------17:13----------
get to live with one port because I'm

---------17:17----------
not going to replace the PCH just to get

---------17:21----------
this to have working USB so what I'm

---------17:24----------
guessing is if something they plugged in

---------17:26----------
something that blew up the power thing

---------17:27----------
on that line they might have also sent

---------17:30----------
whatever the voltage that was to the PCH

---------17:33----------
is data line for that USB port oh so it

---------17:43----------
was the it was the filters after all

---------17:45----------
pull the filters the filters and the

---------17:47----------
diet it was the it was the power thing

---------17:52----------
died so everything on this line died so

---------17:56----------
yeah let's fullscreen so first I

---------18:02----------
replaced the power switch because the

---------18:04----------
power switch was putting out zero volts

---------18:06----------
to both ports so we didn't have USB port

---------18:09----------
B J 4700 and we didn't have a USB port a

---------18:13----------
so then after I replaced you 4600 which

---------18:16----------
is going to allow power to go through we

---------18:17----------
got five volts on both ports but only

---------18:19----------
this port worked now the difference

---------18:21----------
between USB port B and USB port a what

---------18:23----------
makes this port unique is that this port

---------18:25----------
can communicate with the SMC rather than

---------18:27----------
with the normal you know USB

---------18:30----------
communicating with the the actual PCH

---------18:33----------
and the CPU of the computer so instead

---------18:35----------
of being the USB port it could

---------18:36----------
communicate with the SMC so first thing

---------18:38----------
we did was made sure that this was being

---------18:43----------
told to enable USB mode so over here it

---------18:45----------
says SMC debug port enable underscore L

---------18:49----------
and that means you know enable it as a

---------18:52----------
debug port when that signal is low

---------18:54----------
meaning zero volts was 3.3 volts we

---------18:56----------
tried replacing the MUX that didn't work

---------18:58----------
at that point I decided screw it we're

---------19:00----------
gonna replace everything along the USB

---------19:02----------
data line so we have two different

---------19:04----------
filters in the USB data line these

---------19:06----------
filters are going to be used to keep

---------19:07----------
noise out of the line like the noise in

---------19:09----------
the next room

---------19:11----------
they're having a party they must not be

---------19:13----------
doing work must fire everybody so this

---------19:16----------
over here is a filter for the USB to

---------19:19----------
section of

---------19:20----------
the data line over here it says USB 3 XT

---------19:23----------
USB 3 this is the extra this is the

---------19:26----------
extra crap I should know this is this

---------19:28----------
means external not extra I was my brain

---------19:31----------
was putting an R where there wasn't what

---------19:33----------
but so this is the extra data line for

---------19:36----------
USB 3 so USB 2 typically only has this

---------19:39----------
positive and negative USB 3 has an

---------19:41----------
additional positive a negative to make

---------19:43----------
it the more faster and the more better

---------19:45----------
so after we replaced that that and these

---------19:47----------
diodes that were on the data line it

---------19:53----------
worked and we had the USB and now USB is

---------19:58----------
fixed and with that we can move on to

---------20:02----------
the next board and as always I hope you

---------20:04----------
learned something by the way in case you

---------20:06----------
haven't heard I did get myself a new

---------20:08----------
computer after five years of using a

---------20:10----------
machine with a dying CPU two drives with

---------20:13----------
bad sectors graphics chip that would

---------20:17----------
randomly flicker cause the machine to

---------20:18----------
crash or stop outputting 60 Hertz to my

---------20:21----------
monitor two SSDs with 78 terabytes of

---------20:23----------
write cycles on them each that were not

---------20:25----------
exactly working their best I finally

---------20:28----------
have a new state of the art machine so

---------20:29----------
I'm gonna do my best to put up one video

---------20:32----------
a day absolute minimum one-minute

---------20:34----------
educational video a day from now until

---------20:36----------
the time that there is no more YouTube

---------20:38----------
so thank you very much for watching and

---------20:40----------
as always I hope you learned something

---------20:41----------
and I hope there's a lot more to learn

---------20:43----------
as I'm able to put out more content into

---------20:44----------
the future

---------20:45----------
now that my machine does not freeze

---------20:47----------
every 30 to 60 seconds so thank you very

---------20:50----------
much and I'll see you in the next one
