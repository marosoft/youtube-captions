---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:01----------
we're gonna get started working on yet

---------00:03----------
another dead macbook this macbook

---------00:05----------
appears to not be turning on it's an 8

---------00:06----------
1707 touch bar 15-inch MacBook Pro let's

---------00:09----------
get started and see if we can figure out

---------00:11----------
what's wrong with it and make it work

---------00:13----------
again the first thing I need to do is

---------00:16----------
get my pentalobe screwdriver which is

---------00:22----------
not here hello it used to be here which

---------00:26----------
means that somebody is going to die

---------00:29----------
nevermind we just found it someone's

---------00:32----------
life has just been saved 5 volts 330ml

---------00:36----------
amps 20 volts 340 MLMs

---------00:39----------
note that the amperage draw is the same

---------00:42----------
regardless of the voltage we're getting

---------00:46----------
330 to 340 milliamp draw it's static

---------00:49----------
it's not moving up and down but above

---------00:51----------
all it stays the same whether it's a 20

---------00:53----------
volts or 5 volts the first thing that

---------00:57----------
I'd like to do here is if we have a

---------00:59----------
short on our pp bus PB bus g3 hop

---------01:02----------
one of the main power rails let's get

---------01:04----------
Paul Daniels is amazing software up on

---------01:06----------
the screen

---------01:07----------
ah a P P bus g3 hot short wonder where

---------01:15----------
that could be let's take the board out

---------01:17----------
of the case and see if we can locate it

---------01:19----------
I don't have another cat6 cable in my

---------01:21----------
office yet so I won't be able to plug in

---------01:23----------
the thermal camera luckily I have a face

---------01:25----------
and I'm gonna use that face to try and

---------01:27----------
find out where my short-circuit is are

---------01:33----------
you all ready to help me locate the

---------01:35----------
cause of the short circuit in this

---------01:36----------
MacBook beautiful beautiful I'm glad to

---------01:45----------
hear that you're all willing to help me

---------01:46----------
as I try and fix this MacBook I'm never

---------01:50----------
gonna have a camera that's mounted

---------01:52----------
properly because that would take time

---------01:54----------
time that I don't have it's always going

---------02:00----------
to be a little shakey camera above my

---------02:01----------
head that's just the way it is here at

---------02:05----------
Rossman repair group

---------02:07----------
it's just the way it is let's say a big

---------02:11----------
thank you to every single one of us here

---------02:13----------
that decided to tune in for the stream

---------02:15----------
thank you to all of you people on

---------02:17----------
YouTube and twitch Wow my screwdriver

---------02:22----------
rolled over and fell on the floor and

---------02:24----------
the screw is still attached to it that's

---------02:27----------
crazy

---------02:28----------
that was one stubborn screw right there

---------02:33----------
have any of you ever had a stubborn

---------02:35----------
screw in the past okay I think I have an

---------02:38----------
idea where my problem may lie with this

---------02:40----------
computer let's see if we can find it and

---------02:47----------
show you all so that maybe you can learn

---------02:50----------
a little bit of board repair okay now

---------02:58----------
one of the things that you may see if

---------03:00----------
you're looking at the screen right on

---------03:02----------
the bottom corner is a huge burn mark

---------03:07----------
see that burn mark this is an apple

---------03:12----------
product so every now and then it's gonna

---------03:14----------
blow up just because how they get you to

---------03:18----------
buy a new one so let's take a look and

---------03:22----------
see what's going on on that section of

---------03:24----------
the board hmm this looks a little funky

---------03:30----------
look at that look at that Apple said

---------03:36----------
this machine was damaged by liquid I

---------03:38----------
don't happen to see any liquid though do

---------03:41----------
you

---------03:42----------
Apple told this customer there was

---------03:44----------
liquid damage but if you take a look

---------03:46----------
around the board there's not a speck of

---------03:49----------
liquid damage on it I don't see any

---------03:51----------
liquid I just see a machine that decided

---------03:53----------
to blow itself up for no good reason

---------03:57----------
let's take a look closer into the

---------03:59----------
microscope mm-hmm yeah see that mmm that

---------04:07----------
does not look like liquid damage that

---------04:10----------
looks like a little capacitor that

---------04:13----------
exploded why did it explode

---------04:18----------
and asked him cook speaking of explosion

---------04:21----------
check out the flickering microscope

---------04:23----------
light I have so a lot of you suggest

---------04:26----------
that I get that little polarizer filter

---------04:27----------
I found one that fits my microscope for

---------04:29----------
about 120 bucks and a dorama but that

---------04:32----------
requires more light on the microscope

---------04:34----------
than what I have so what I did to make

---------04:39----------
it work was I started pumping more

---------04:41----------
voltage through my microscope light i

---------04:42----------
over clocked it and now it flickers it's

---------04:47----------
actually not happy with me trying to put

---------04:49----------
15 volts through a microscope light so

---------04:52----------
it flickers every now and then I think

---------04:59----------
I'm just going to keep it like that I

---------05:01----------
have hit a point of shock with my new

---------05:05----------
space where I am tired of spending money

---------05:08----------
and no new money will be spent for a

---------05:11----------
while on any sort of upgrades of

---------05:13----------
equipment got several new stations lots

---------05:17----------
of new stuff lots of new desks new space

---------05:19----------
all the stuff good stuff but nope I'm

---------05:23----------
gonna let that thing flicker until it

---------05:25----------
dies

---------05:34----------
when their keep using that microscope

---------05:36----------
light until it looks like the inside of

---------05:38----------
this Apple product here now this thing

---------05:41----------
is probably gonna be kind of welded to

---------05:42----------
the board so it's gonna be interesting

---------05:44----------
to get this off I'm gonna there we go

---------05:50----------
BAM

---------05:51----------
came right off a little bit of flux and

---------05:58----------
wick to suck up that old solder will

---------06:02----------
help me out so we've got some flux there

---------06:06----------
the polarizer worked Rob Brown it's not

---------06:09----------
it I think it did its job the problem

---------06:12----------
now is not the polarizer it's the fact

---------06:14----------
that the increased light that I needed

---------06:15----------
to put through this little cheap-ass

---------06:17----------
ring light that I have has caused it to

---------06:22----------
flicker and die there are some nicer

---------06:25----------
ring lights I've seen it's like 100

---------06:27----------
bucks but nope I'm done I bow out

---------06:39----------
okay

---------06:42----------
now we're gonna make this nice and clean

---------06:44----------
before we put a replacement capacitor on

---------06:47----------
this board and remember that capacitor

---------06:50----------
didn't just kill itself it was liquid

---------06:54----------
damage and if you believe that Jeffrey

---------07:00----------
Epstein killed himself in prison

---------07:07----------
all right

---------07:18----------
gonna burn away some of that alcohol

---------07:19----------
before we get started add some nice

---------07:27----------
happy flux do that happy flux right

---------07:32----------
there and add a small amount of solder

---------07:35----------
to each pad not a lot just a small

---------07:39----------
amount a small number they would say

---------07:47----------
now we add a modicum more flux and we're

---------07:50----------
gonna hot air a new capacitor into place

---------07:53----------
and once we put a new cap there

---------07:55----------
we've likely will have solved our

---------07:57----------
problem and the board will work again

---------08:01----------
liquid damage my balls Apple liquid

---------08:04----------
damage my balls the only liquid I see on

---------08:08----------
this board is the liquid that likely

---------08:10----------
squirted out of the capacitor when it

---------08:12----------
blew up inside this innocent customers

---------08:14----------
machine why Apple why do you lie to your

---------08:19----------
customers money all they have to do is

---------08:22----------
tell the truth

---------08:23----------
imagine they'd have a much better

---------08:25----------
reputation but they don't tell the truth

---------08:27----------
and why don't they tell the truth it's

---------08:30----------
not that hard to do

---------08:31----------
wow that light is really strobing now

---------08:34----------
look at that microscope light it's not

---------08:39----------
even that bad it's getting twelve point

---------08:40----------
eight volts

---------08:41----------
calm down ring light calm down

---------08:44----------
chillax but nothing flicker trying to

---------08:48----------
give my viewers a seizure Aaron when you

---------08:52----------
say so we attribute some malice which

---------08:54----------
could be attributed to stupidity now it

---------08:58----------
would be different if this were

---------08:59----------
happening in 2012 13 14 15 16 17 even 18

---------09:03----------
around the time that CBC news piece came

---------09:05----------
out but if you've been made aware of it

---------09:07----------
and you still you make no changes

---------09:10----------
whatsoever for years and years on end

---------09:13----------
afterwards then at some point you're

---------09:15----------
responsible for that stupidity the very

---------09:18----------
allowing that stupidity to continue to

---------09:20----------
exist is in and of itself malice

---------09:35----------
[Music]

---------09:38----------
I have not Teresa I've not seen your

---------09:40----------
formal feral kitten

---------09:50----------
that campus sitter looks different but

---------09:53----------
it's the same value so it'll work just

---------09:56----------
fine gonna clean that up a little bit

---------10:03----------
I'm not gonna hot glue the capacitor

---------10:06----------
that will be the wrong thing to do

---------10:26----------
down down down down down down your ring

---------10:33----------
light is trying to seize your viewers

---------10:35----------
like custom CC fresh batteries that's a

---------10:38----------
good one I like that yeah I don't know

---------10:42----------
why I got the polarizer I tried to make

---------10:44----------
the channel a little bit better I did

---------10:45----------
but I did my best there I over clocked

---------10:50----------
that ring light as much as I could it's

---------10:53----------
not happy with me

---------10:55----------
don't overclock the ring light it makes

---------10:59----------
it mad Jesu sends butcher's his review

---------11:01----------
Titan r-tx if he can get companies to

---------11:05----------
send him a twenty five hundred dollar

---------11:07----------
graphics card to review he's a better

---------11:09----------
influencer than I am the only thing I

---------11:12----------
remember getting sent for free to review

---------11:13----------
was his piece-of-shit Dynalite

---------11:16----------
microscope and I don't even want to call

---------11:18----------
it a $700 microscope camera because what

---------11:21----------
they did is they took some webcam for me

---------11:23----------
it looked like a webcam from 10 or 15

---------11:25----------
years ago that had a VGA output that

---------11:27----------
they had a convert to HDMI with a box

---------11:29----------
that looked like total [ __ ] and they

---------11:32----------
were selling it for 700 bucks and now

---------11:33----------
this was about four years ago that they

---------11:35----------
sent me that thing to review it was

---------11:36----------
awful

---------11:37----------
absolutely awful and Everest I reviewed

---------11:40----------
that thing oh I got a vacuum cleaner I

---------11:43----------
got a piece-of-shit vacuum cleaner that

---------11:44----------
couldn't go over or like the that I

---------11:46----------
swear that thing couldn't go over a

---------11:47----------
speaker wire it was such a piece of [ __ ]

---------11:49----------
supposed to be some sort of smart vacuum

---------11:51----------
but it was there that thing was worth

---------11:53----------
probably like 30 bucks all right let's

---------11:55----------
see if this thing turns on at all

---------13:07----------
it's taking six hundred milliamps 490

---------13:11----------
MLMs 480 mill amps 580 million seven

---------13:15----------
hundred milliamps and now we have an

---------13:17----------
Apple logo the Apple logo lets me know

---------13:19----------
that this machine is turning on this

---------13:21----------
still could use a full suite of tests

---------13:23----------
before we consider it to be done and

---------13:25----------
unfortunately the people that are going

---------13:27----------
to do the full suite of tests are a

---------13:28----------
little backed up right now since they

---------13:31----------
were not doing work during the moving

---------13:33----------
process because they were packing and

---------13:34----------
everything else so but this looks like

---------13:37----------
it is fully set the problem with this

---------13:41----------
machine was not liquid damage that

---------13:43----------
wasn't the problem at all

---------13:44----------
the problem with this computer is that a

---------13:47----------
capacitor and it exploded without any

---------13:50----------
seemingly good reason for it which is

---------13:52----------
fine this happens in electronics

---------13:54----------
sometimes capacitors are just gonna say

---------13:56----------
I don't want to be part of a Macbook

---------13:58----------
anymore and just just off themselves

---------14:00----------
like that the problem is with this is

---------14:02----------
saying that it's water damaged when it's

---------14:05----------
not water damaged that's screwed up the

---------14:07----------
only liquid that was even somewhat here

---------14:10----------
is if you want to call what popped out

---------14:11----------
of that capacitor when it exploded

---------14:13----------
liquid it's kind of like showing up at a

---------14:15----------
health insurance company in getting beat

---------14:17----------
in the head with a baseball bat by the

---------14:18----------
receptionist and then being told by the

---------14:20----------
underwriter you're not going to be able

---------14:23----------
to get health care because you have a

---------14:24----------
pre-existing condition of a concussion

---------14:26----------
yes you do but why maybe I'd be better

---------14:29----------
at analogies if it wasn't 11 o'clock at

---------14:31----------
night

---------14:32----------
who knows either way that's it for today

---------14:35----------
and as always I hope you learned

---------14:37----------
something see you in the next video
