---------00:00----------
okay so today we're gonna be going over

---------00:01----------
an 8 to 0 29:36 that's not turning on so

---------00:05----------
somebody tried to replace their own

---------00:06----------
keyboard and clean their motherboard and

---------00:08----------
it was working just a few of the keys

---------00:09----------
weren't working and after replacing

---------00:11----------
their own keyboard now it is dead so

---------00:14----------
let's see what's going on here so the

---------00:16----------
first thing that I'm gonna do here is

---------00:17----------
plug in the charger with a fresh new DC

---------00:19----------
on board to see what I get and with a

---------00:21----------
different known good DC on board I get

---------00:23----------
no light in the charger no fan spin and

---------00:26----------
no anything so the first thing I'm gonna

---------00:28----------
do here is I'm gonna open up the

---------00:30----------
schematic and the board view for this

---------00:32----------
model machine so that you can kind of

---------00:33----------
get an idea of what it is that that I'm

---------00:36----------
trying to do here and what it is that

---------00:37----------
I'm looking at while I'm trying to

---------00:39----------
diagnose the cause of the problem so

---------00:41----------
let's go over to the schematic over here

---------00:43----------
and look at how this thing is supposed

---------00:44----------
to work that's not the schematic that's

---------00:48----------
the schematic all right so what we're

---------00:50----------
gonna do here is we're gonna go to page

---------00:52----------
3 of the schematic where they give you

---------00:53----------
this whole little idea of how everything

---------00:55----------
works so over here we have the AC

---------00:57----------
adapter in and that's gonna go to this

---------01:00----------
chip which creates PP bus g3 hop it's

---------01:02----------
also going to go through this chip which

---------01:03----------
creates PP 3 V 4 2 2 this chip which

---------01:06----------
sends power to the SMC I mean the reset

---------01:09----------
signal to the SMC which will tell the

---------01:10----------
SMC to turn on so let's get an idea of

---------01:12----------
what it is I get add a few different

---------01:14----------
points so when I go to try and measure

---------01:16----------
around this board I'm gonna put the

---------01:18----------
voltage I'm a multimeter into voltage

---------01:20----------
mode over here and it's really I finally

---------01:22----------
got a kind of camera angle that works

---------01:23----------
for me that is not you know interrupt

---------01:26----------
what I'm doing but also allows you to

---------01:28----------
see the multimeter which is which is

---------01:29----------
nice here then what I'm gonna do is I am

---------01:33----------
actually get better you'll be able to

---------01:35----------
see the meter better if I move this

---------01:36----------
thing over a little and I move it to the

---------01:39----------
side so let's might as well go ahead and

---------01:40----------
do that now yeah a little bit of a

---------01:47----------
better view alrighty so now I'm gonna

---------01:54----------
measure voltage on pp 3 v 4 - now to

---------01:56----------
find pp 3 V 4 - what I would do on this

---------01:58----------
board view software over here is I let's

---------02:01----------
just see if I can get us so you can view

---------02:03----------
there we go so on the board view

---------02:06----------
software what I would do is I would type

---------02:07----------
N for Nets which is going to show me

---------02:09----------
every section on the board that a

---------02:11----------
specific rail comes up

---------02:13----------
a signal and then type EP 3v4 to

---------02:15----------
underscore g3 hot that is needed for the

---------02:17----------
one wire circuit if you don't understand

---------02:19----------
why please watch my one wire circuit

---------02:20----------
videos they're important if you are

---------02:22----------
going to understand this one I have many

---------02:24----------
videos in the one wire circuit they're

---------02:26----------
usually about 10 15 minutes just watch

---------02:28----------
one of them it will save you a lot of

---------02:30----------
heartache in trouble so I have three

---------02:33----------
point 42 volts now the next power rail

---------02:35----------
that I'm gonna check which comes in

---------02:36----------
right after the charger over here is

---------02:37----------
going to be pp bus g3 hot so let's check

---------02:41----------
pp bus underscore g3 hot now I'm not

---------02:45----------
gonna expect to get anything there

---------02:46----------
because I don't have a green light I

---------02:47----------
should have a green light my you know I

---------02:49----------
have three point 42 volts which is the

---------02:51----------
rail that powers the one wire circuit

---------02:53----------
but you know I don't have a green light

---------02:54----------
so we're gonna have to look into why it

---------02:57----------
is that I don't have a green light

---------03:00----------
and of course BP buzz g3 on is at 0.2

---------03:04----------
volts so the way the one wire circuit

---------03:06----------
works is I need to have a power at a

---------03:09----------
certain component and I also need to

---------03:11----------
have a signal at that component so this

---------03:13----------
here is a damper sense this is where the

---------03:15----------
charger is going to speak to the SMC on

---------03:18----------
a data line so the charger is going to

---------03:20----------
come into this chip on external then

---------03:23----------
it's gonna speak to the SMC on the

---------03:24----------
internal pins this one wire goes

---------03:26----------
straight to the SMC in order for this

---------03:28----------
trip to receive the power that it needs

---------03:29----------
at the VCC pin to turn on it needs to

---------03:31----------
have power delivered to it by you 6901

---------03:33----------
and used to clear no one is gonna take

---------03:35----------
PP 3v4 to and pass it over here if SM

---------03:38----------
CBC a CLK is present so let's see if sm

---------03:41----------
c bc AC okay is present so I looked for

---------03:45----------
you 6901 and you 6901 is going to be

---------03:48----------
right over here

---------03:51----------
let's is what I'm looking for that is

---------03:54----------
what I'm looking for right so I am gonna

---------03:57----------
try with the microscope now I'm gonna

---------03:59----------
take a look at that area see what it

---------04:00----------
looks like and give a little measurement

---------04:02----------
so let's get the board under the

---------04:04----------
microscope over here so that you can see

---------04:06----------
it so this is you 6901 and that area

---------04:10----------
looks pretty nice looks pretty far it

---------04:11----------
looks like nothing bad happen there

---------04:12----------
except for my microscope trying to run

---------04:14----------
away so let's just tighten the

---------04:15----------
microscope so it can't run away

---------04:20----------
so let's measure so smc bc AC okay is

---------04:25----------
going to be present right over here

---------04:29----------
I believe let's see so yeah right over

---------04:32----------
here so see it has s MC bc AC okay over

---------04:34----------
there so let's check it out and let's

---------04:38----------
see what I get

---------04:39----------
on my multimeter when I measure that pin

---------04:41----------
so on that pin for smc bc AC okay i get

---------04:47----------
zero point zero zero zero volts i'm

---------04:51----------
closed so i'm not answering the phone

---------04:53----------
right now so we get zero volts there so

---------04:56----------
where does sm c bc AC okay come from so

---------04:58----------
let's see where s MC bc AC okay comes

---------05:01----------
from so is sm c bc AC okay comes from

---------05:04----------
the used 7,000 ship so let's check out

---------05:06----------
the u 7,000 ship and other videos i've

---------05:09----------
said that this ship needs to receive

---------05:10----------
four volts at charger AC n before sm c

---------05:13----------
bc AC okay will occur so this is where

---------05:16----------
PPD c and g three hot which is the power

---------05:18----------
from the adapter comes in the power from

---------05:20----------
the adapter comes in through here and

---------05:22----------
goes to this voltage divider from this

---------05:24----------
voltage divider it's going to go to pin

---------05:26----------
three charger AC n over here so let's

---------05:29----------
see if i have voltage at pin three of

---------05:32----------
you 7000 and please stop opening this on

---------05:35----------
the other monitor

---------05:36----------
alright so use 7000 find this and let's

---------05:41----------
see where is our 70 10 in our 70 11

---------05:44----------
right over here so these two so let's

---------05:46----------
see if i have four volts over there

---------05:48----------
let's also see what that area looks like

---------05:50----------
on the microscope

---------06:05----------
red points over here tell me a sad story

---------06:07----------
for was something that went on in this

---------06:09----------
area so you see that and then you see

---------06:11----------
that well let's take let's go and go

---------06:14----------
ahead and measure anyway let's also get

---------06:16----------
this microscope to a more comfortable

---------06:17----------
position okay yeah swivel for me

---------06:27----------
excellent good stuff okay so

---------06:37----------
focus there we go let's measure

---------06:44----------
interesting zero volts very interesting

---------06:50----------
so we have 16 volts at the top of the

---------06:52----------
voltage divider but at the other side of

---------06:54----------
it I have zero hmm here's where this

---------07:01----------
gets tricky the problem is that we could

---------07:04----------
have a couple of there's a couple of

---------07:05----------
things that could be going on here let's

---------07:07----------
just go over the couple of things that

---------07:08----------
could be going on here so this chip the

---------07:12----------
u 7,000 could be pulling it to ground

---------07:14----------
this resistor R 7010 could be bad

---------07:18----------
our seventy eleven could be open meaning

---------07:21----------
not I don't mean open I mean our seventy

---------07:23----------
eleven could be at zero homes our 70 10

---------07:28----------
could be at infinite ohms or u 7,000

---------07:31----------
could be pulling that signal to ground

---------07:32----------
now let's think a little bit about the

---------07:34----------
basic electronics video series that I

---------07:36----------
did where I said how resistors often

---------07:37----------
fail resistors often fail to where they

---------07:41----------
are working at infinite resistance so we

---------07:43----------
can throw out the idea of our seven the

---------07:45----------
eleven failing and becoming zero ohms

---------07:48----------
pretty quickly our 7010 could very

---------07:50----------
easily have opened and not be providing

---------07:53----------
power or you seven thousand could be

---------07:55----------
dead as a result of a shock to it and it

---------07:57----------
could be shorting charger AC into ground

---------07:59----------
let's take a look now what I'm gonna do

---------08:01----------
here is I'm gonna measure our seventy 10

---------08:03----------
and if our 70 10 manages to be around

---------08:07----------
thirty kilo ohms then I am going to jump

---------08:09----------
to the assumption that you seven

---------08:10----------
thousand is bad just based on the

---------08:12----------
knowledge that I have on how these

---------08:14----------
resistors often die remember capacitors

---------08:17----------
often die where the capacitor itself has

---------08:21----------
the you know it turns into a wire they

---------08:23----------
can very often short but resistors

---------08:26----------
themselves really don't often short so

---------08:28----------
what I see here is that I'm getting

---------08:30----------
twenty six point twenty two kilo ohms

---------08:31----------
which is really close to the value in

---------08:33----------
the schematic so at this point I'm gonna

---------08:34----------
make the assumption that my you seven

---------08:36----------
thousand chip is probably bad and my you

---------08:38----------
seven thousand chip probably needs to be

---------08:40----------
replaced so this is where I'm gonna turn

---------08:41----------
on the rework station and I'm gonna get

---------08:44----------
started with removing that chip and

---------08:46----------
putting on another one so first thing to

---------08:49----------
do here is remove my

---------08:51----------
7,000 chip which is this one so that I

---------08:53----------
can put on a new one now I have the air

---------08:55----------
filter on high and I have it located

---------08:56----------
right next to where I'm working because

---------08:58----------
I don't want to inhale any of this crap

---------09:00----------
and I highly suggest it you do the same

---------09:02----------
remember it doesn't matter what other

---------09:04----------
people tell you because nobody's gonna

---------09:06----------
care about your health the way you

---------09:08----------
should care about your health so if

---------09:10----------
you're doing this stuff use an air

---------09:12----------
filter use a fume extractor and if you

---------09:16----------
can't they're the very least try not to

---------09:18----------
inhale it do this and go every time you

---------09:21----------
get stuck next to a bunch of nasty fumes

---------09:34----------
a hackle fr Adel one has removed it with

---------09:37----------
ease

---------09:46----------
hey're for placing a new chip

---------09:50----------
so I got my nice hack Oh FM 2032 here I

---------09:54----------
love this thing let's get rid of all the

---------10:00----------
old junk and

---------10:24----------
okay too much solder on the center pad

---------10:26----------
is my hallmark

---------10:28----------
I should have whipped that but I didn't

---------10:30----------
today require changing irons and I know

---------10:32----------
I can get away without any of that okay

---------10:38----------
the chip has been removed new chip is

---------10:42----------
about to be applied way too much solder

---------10:47----------
on the center pad is my hallmark I

---------10:51----------
really should stop that habit it's heat

---------10:58----------
get you somewhere on the board here we

---------11:03----------
go nice try

---------11:06----------
see I was trying to spin trying to

---------11:09----------
change orientations on me okay and I

---------11:17----------
push down really hard the most important

---------11:19----------
thing here when soldering the ISL 65:9

---------11:21----------
chip the most important thing is to make

---------11:23----------
sure that you push down hard so that the

---------11:26----------
chip itself actually gets soldered on

---------11:28----------
the board because you may think it's

---------11:29----------
soldered but then when you look up round

---------11:31----------
at an angle you'll realize that it's not

---------11:33----------
soldered that's with this really nice

---------11:39----------
hack OFM 22 is good at is going around

---------11:42----------
and getting every single pin so again it

---------11:44----------
may look like it's solder from the top

---------11:45----------
but then you're gonna look at it from

---------11:46----------
the side and you'll realize that it's

---------11:47----------
not actually soldered it you know it's

---------11:50----------
sitting on top of a mound but one of the

---------11:52----------
two of those pads isn't properly

---------11:54----------
soldered you know a really important

---------11:56----------
thing when soldering these components to

---------11:57----------
have them flat on the board and when you

---------11:59----------
have a center pad it's really easy for

---------12:01----------
it to float on the solder on the center

---------12:03----------
pad instead of lemons that have actually

---------12:06----------
fallen a place so even after I know that

---------12:10----------
I've pushed a flat on the board I go

---------12:11----------
around with this and I want to feel

---------12:13----------
every single pad I want to feel every

---------12:16----------
single pin I want to feel each

---------12:18----------
individual joint with my iron and you

---------12:20----------
can actually and you'll feel it you'll

---------12:21----------
get used to this I assure you you will

---------12:23----------
feel it

---------12:25----------
and you'll know when you soldered it on

---------12:27----------
there properly

---------12:32----------
soldering this chip in properly because

---------12:34----------
of lack of knowledge or a station

---------12:36----------
or very common causes of frustration and

---------12:40----------
failure

---------12:58----------
so what happened here is I plugged it in

---------13:01----------
after replacing that and as you can see

---------13:03----------
I have a green light and my fan is

---------13:06----------
spinning which means that I solved my

---------13:09----------
problem

---------13:09----------
so you 7000 here was most likely pulling

---------13:13----------
down my charger a.cian signal because it

---------13:16----------
was and it most likely got

---------13:18----------
by honestly who the hell knows I really

---------13:23----------
have no idea what people do when they

---------13:24----------
work on their own stuff but it was

---------13:26----------
 and now it's not and now

---------13:28----------
it works and we have a happy eight to

---------13:30----------
zero twenty nine thirty six ready to go

---------13:32----------
back into a customer laptop and that's

---------13:34----------
that and I hope you learned something

---------13:44----------
and the last thing I want to mention

---------13:45----------
before I exit out of this video because

---------13:48----------
this is a common question a lot of

---------13:49----------
people ask me you know one of the things

---------13:50----------
I want to learn from your tutoring class

---------13:52----------
one of those I want to learn is how to

---------13:53----------
measure each individual component I want

---------13:55----------
to know how to measure this that or the

---------13:57----------
other and the reality is you don't sit

---------13:59----------
here measuring logic gates you don't sit

---------14:01----------
here measuring you seven thousands what

---------14:03----------
you do to fix these products is you just

---------14:05----------
use your brain you have regions and you

---------14:07----------
have theories and you have ideas and you

---------14:08----------
you try to turn those ideas into a

---------14:10----------
working solution so I know that sounds

---------14:12----------
silly but let's just look over here at

---------14:15----------
this particular schematic so if I were

---------14:17----------
to measure this resistor right let's say

---------14:19----------
I'm measuring the resistors the u 7000

---------14:21----------
is shorted to ground right this is

---------14:24----------
attached to ground on one end so this

---------14:26----------
resistor R 70 11 over here it's attached

---------14:29----------
to ground on one end so if I measure the

---------14:32----------
resistance of our seventy eleven with

---------14:33----------
the to you seven thousand you seven

---------14:35----------
thousand is and shorted to ground

---------14:36----------
right so that's over here short it's a

---------14:39----------
ground this end over here is also

---------14:41----------
shorted to ground so when I measure that

---------14:43----------
resistor you think I'm gonna get 9.31

---------14:45----------
kilohms

---------14:45----------
know when I measure this resistor I'm

---------14:47----------
going to get zero homes because the use

---------14:50----------
seven thousand which this resistor is

---------14:51----------
attached to is shorted to ground now you

---------14:54----------
may say well you could take the resistor

---------14:56----------
off the board to measure that's the

---------14:57----------
right thing to do when I take a resistor

---------14:59----------
off of a motherboard that is this many

---------15:01----------
components that this small and I

---------15:02----------
put it on the table you know what's

---------15:03----------
gonna happen to that resistor when I go

---------15:05----------
to measure it I'm gonna go like this and

---------15:07----------
I'm gonna go doink

---------15:08----------
it's it's gonna fly it's gonna go into

---------15:10----------
the sixth dimension

---------15:11----------
I will never ever see it again so you

---------15:15----------
know a lot of my my Diagnostics is not

---------15:17----------
measuring every single resistor

---------15:19----------
measuring every single capacitor it's

---------15:22----------
just having a little bit of an

---------15:23----------
understanding of how the circuit works

---------15:24----------
getting an idea of what happened how did

---------15:27----------
this fail why did it fail what are some

---------15:28----------
of the theories as to you know how it

---------15:31----------
failed how does what the board tells me

---------15:33----------
line up with my theories as to why it

---------15:35----------
failed for example having a little red

---------15:37----------
probe points around the chip and then

---------15:39----------
noticing that there are two things that

---------15:40----------
can be shorted to ground that chip of

---------15:41----------
the resistor and then just having an

---------15:43----------
idea of how resistors work or is how

---------15:45----------
resistors fail resistors usually fail

---------15:47----------
open where there is an open line and not

---------15:50----------
where there's you know zero resistance

---------15:51----------
just having all the stuff in the back of

---------15:53----------
my head is what allowed me to fix this

---------15:55----------
it wasn't really measuring every single

---------15:56----------
individual resistor or capacitor on the

---------15:59----------
motherboard

---------15:59----------
using the multimeter so yeah just to get

---------16:02----------
just to get it across you don't think

---------16:04----------
some other boards by measuring every

---------16:05----------
single component on them you'll never

---------16:07----------
get anyway you will lose your mind you

---------16:09----------
measure motherboards through having a

---------16:10----------
bit of an understanding of how that

---------16:12----------
board works how that circuit works

---------16:13----------
asking yourself how you know what do you

---------16:16----------
think the fault was and then just just

---------16:19----------
figuring it out no I don't really know

---------16:21----------
how to explain it much better than that
