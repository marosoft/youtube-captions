---------00:00----------
calling from the law firm of kilpatrick

---------00:01----------
townsend stockton and we represent apple

---------00:03----------
and i'm calling to speak with mr.

---------00:05----------
Rothman here we have an a 1707 that's

---------00:07----------
not turning on this is a 15 inch touch

---------00:10----------
bar Mac Pro from other 2016 or 2017 and

---------00:14----------
it appears to be dead so let's open it

---------00:16----------
up and see what's going on in the inside

---------00:17----------
of this MacBook Pro put it on the mat

---------00:20----------
take the screws out of the bottom of it

---------00:22----------
now there's no more battery attached and

---------00:27----------
we're gonna see how many amps this takes

---------00:28----------
in a USBC amp meter I also want to see

---------00:31----------
if it's stuck at 5 volts

---------00:32----------
or if it makes its way to 20 volts you

---------00:34----------
can get a USBC ammeter on stored out

---------00:36----------
Rossmann groov.com

---------00:37----------
now it's taking 5 volts at a hundred

---------00:41----------
milliamps so 5 volts means that the USBC

---------00:43----------
charger is not being told to put out the

---------00:45----------
right amount of power remember if this

---------00:47----------
is a MacBook it's gonna put out 20 if

---------00:48----------
it's a phone or a GoPro it's gonna put

---------00:50----------
out 5 but the machine needs to speak to

---------00:52----------
the charger and say I am a MacBook I

---------00:54----------
need more power send me more power but

---------00:57----------
it's not doing that and we're gonna try

---------00:58----------
and figure out why that is we got to

---------01:00----------
take the board out of the case in order

---------01:01----------
to do that as a story story going on

---------01:03----------
well I'm waiting to hear back from this

---------01:04----------
one space we'll see if the guy sends me

---------01:06----------
Elise I may have to do a little

---------01:08----------
back-and-forth negotiating he wants me

---------01:10----------
to sign a personal guarantee and have a

---------01:13----------
four month deposit at fit now he first

---------01:15----------
is at three to six months I was hoping

---------01:16----------
it would be three months but when he hit

---------01:18----------
me with that we want you to personally

---------01:19----------
guarantee the lease yourself and sign a

---------01:22----------
personal guarantee

---------01:23----------
oh you're pushing it but fine it's a

---------01:26----------
nice space but then when they hit me

---------01:28----------
with the you know we want a four month

---------01:29----------
deposit and you to personally guarantee

---------01:32----------
it that's a bit of a kick in the nuts AK

---------01:34----------
there you are my opinion you either get

---------01:36----------
your three month deposit and a personal

---------01:38----------
guarantee or you get your four month

---------01:39----------
deposit but no personal guarantee I

---------01:41----------
don't really feel like doing both it's

---------01:43----------
not even a question of whether you can

---------01:45----------
it just kind of feels like getting

---------01:46----------
kicked in the nuts and I'm gonna be

---------01:48----------
putting a good amount of money into the

---------01:51----------
space to make it usable and I don't want

---------01:53----------
to do that if I feel like I'm being

---------01:55----------
kicked in the nuts I don't know if I'm

---------01:57----------
being completely reasonable there or

---------01:59----------
maybe a little unreasonable

---------02:01----------
but you guys decide personal guarantee

---------02:05----------
mean if the landlord has before rent

---------02:06----------
deposits well that means that if I don't

---------02:07----------
pay rents let's say that I say my

---------02:09----------
business is bankrupt by

---------02:11----------
my own rent they can come after me

---------02:13----------
personally I don't plan on going

---------02:14----------
bankrupt any time soon I don't have any

---------02:17----------
plans on doing anything like that but

---------02:20----------
it's just you know I just less

---------02:23----------
comfortable oh we can come after you

---------02:24----------
personally rather than your company and

---------02:26----------
there are landlords that push that and

---------02:27----------
it's it so here the thing is it's okay

---------02:29----------
to push it if it's a good deal like I'll

---------02:31----------
sign that I'll sign something like that

---------02:32----------
if I'm getting a nice deal because you

---------02:35----------
know the risk goes up but if the deal is

---------02:37----------
nice it makes up for it but four months

---------02:40----------
of positive mm-hmm yeah so let's see if

---------02:43----------
when we unplug everything if we are

---------02:45----------
still getting the same thing as before

---------02:47----------
so we were getting five volts instead of

---------02:49----------
twenty volts and let's see what we get

---------02:53----------
now

---------03:00----------
five volts 100 milliamps off

---------03:07----------
I see we get here 5 volts 100 Mille amps

---------03:14----------
on all right here is something that's

---------03:19----------
actually important to learn whichever

---------03:22----------
one is the one that does not loop

---------03:25----------
according to Paul Paul's the one that

---------03:27----------
taught me this

---------03:28----------
so Paul I'll take a bow for the studio

---------03:30----------
audience for this discovery the one

---------03:36----------
that's boot looping is the one that

---------03:38----------
actually is the one that is good the one

---------03:41----------
that does not loop when you're stuck at

---------03:43----------
5 volts that's going to be the one

---------03:44----------
that's causing your problems now let's

---------03:46----------
just go over what I mean by that when I

---------03:47----------
say the one causing your problems what

---------03:49----------
does that mean well there's four charge

---------03:50----------
ports on this machine and for each

---------03:52----------
charge ports that these are not just

---------03:54----------
normal charge ports these are USB

---------03:55----------
seaports there is going to be a brain

---------03:57----------
there's a whole whole ecosystem attached

---------03:59----------
to this so where the P Apple people love

---------04:02----------
ecosystem so we're just going to take a

---------04:05----------
look dive into what that ecosystem is

---------04:07----------
over here so let's take a look at each

---------04:08----------
one of these charge ports so over here

---------04:11----------
you have a charge port one and actually

---------04:14----------
there's two charge ports on that one

---------04:16----------
connector so you got two charge ports

---------04:17----------
over there and the other side you have

---------04:19----------
another connector that the other two

---------04:20----------
charge ports are going to go into over

---------04:21----------
here so see on the desk you have the

---------04:23----------
charge port and each charge for it is on

---------04:27----------
these two charge ports per cable to

---------04:29----------
charge ports here to charge ports there

---------04:31----------
and they go into those connectors now if

---------04:33----------
you click on any one of these charge

---------04:35----------
ports you'll see that there is a bunch

---------04:37----------
of different lines here on the right

---------04:39----------
side and some of these are gonna be data

---------04:42----------
lines that speak to chips on the board

---------04:44----------
so let's just take a look at something

---------04:46----------
like this so what is this for

---------04:48----------
so you have this data line you see c1

---------04:52----------
and that is going to speak to a chip on

---------04:55----------
the bottom of the board let's take a

---------04:57----------
look at what this chip is you 3100 u

---------04:59----------
3100 is going to be a USB C port

---------05:04----------
controller USB C port controller now

---------05:08----------
this chip is going to speak with the

---------05:10----------
charger and say hi hi we're doing USB 2

---------05:13----------
today or hi we're doing USB 3 today or

---------05:16----------
hi we're doing DisplayPort today hi I'm

---------05:18----------
an external graphics card plugged in hi

---------05:20----------
I

---------05:21----------
just wanted I need power from you but no

---------05:23----------
five volts I want 20 so this is more

---------05:26----------
much more involved in your standard

---------05:27----------
laptop charge port when it comes to USB

---------05:29----------
see now the port that wasn't working

---------05:31----------
corresponds to the chip that's on this

---------05:33----------
side of the board so this is this helps

---------05:35----------
me this is a little tool because

---------05:36----------
remember there's four of these USB C

---------05:38----------
port controllers on the board and if

---------05:39----------
even one of them is not working then

---------05:41----------
none of the ports work lowish 2020 yeah

---------05:44----------
like I want my life for him like that

---------05:46----------
haha it's not nothing better than having

---------05:51----------
to walk around for the rest of your life

---------05:53----------
with armed security guards because

---------05:54----------
everybody hates you yeh politics but no

---------05:58----------
the way this is gonna work is a nice one

---------06:01----------
of these chips not working this one this

---------06:04----------
one this one or this one will cause all

---------06:09----------
the USB C ports to not work now the

---------06:11----------
first thing that we need to do before we

---------06:12----------
even start blaming the chips it's see if

---------06:16----------
our main power rail that's required for

---------06:17----------
these chips to work is present now on

---------06:19----------
the older Mac books you need PP 3 before

---------06:20----------
to underscore G 3 hot that has to be

---------06:23----------
present and on these newer machines its

---------06:25----------
PP 3 V 3 underscore g3 hate PP 3 V 3

---------06:29----------
underscore g3 hot that has to be present

---------06:31----------
for anything to work so over here on the

---------06:33----------
top of the chip you're gonna see a lot

---------06:34----------
of different voltage lines one of them

---------06:35----------
here it says VIN voltage in and you

---------06:38----------
follow it back and it goes to people

---------06:40----------
through v3 underscore g3 huh pp 3 b3

---------06:42----------
underscore g3 ha can be measured over

---------06:43----------
here right by the chip so let's see if

---------06:45----------
that's present because that voltage

---------06:46----------
rails needed the turn on my machine so

---------06:48----------
we're gonna plug this in to the charger

---------06:51----------
we're gonna put the multimeter software

---------06:54----------
on the screen 3.3 so the voltage is

---------07:00----------
there it is receiving the voltage that

---------07:02----------
it needs to turn on now the other thing

---------07:04----------
you may notice if you're taking a look

---------07:05----------
at this area is that there's corrosion

---------07:07----------
in that area right by what could be a

---------07:10----------
crucial resistor on the lower left

---------07:12----------
corner so let's take a look on the

---------07:14----------
schematic and see what that resistor is

---------07:16----------
for it seems like that is 1.8 volts

---------07:20----------
going to grant it's just a pulldown

---------07:22----------
resistor for what looks like a data line

---------07:25----------
and that's actually not really even an

---------07:28----------
important data line this is looks like

---------07:30----------
it's for debug

---------07:39----------
yeah nope so that's odd well I'm gonna

---------07:42----------
guess is that we've got some corrosion

---------07:43----------
underneath the chip itself so let's give

---------07:45----------
the chip of a minor reflow we're just

---------07:48----------
gonna put a little bit of authentic

---------07:49----------
Amtech flux over there and if we put a

---------07:51----------
little bit of authentic Ametek flux then

---------07:54----------
we should be good to go

---------07:56----------
regarding reef lowing that ship alright

---------07:59----------
there we go we've got some ham tech flux

---------08:02----------
let's put our fume extractor on so that

---------08:05----------
we don't inhale that

---------08:18----------
eat the board

---------08:21----------
be patient

---------08:34----------
let the flux heal you the flux will heal

---------08:39----------
you if you allow the flux to heal you

---------08:58----------
yeah

---------09:05----------
the Fox is healing

---------09:08----------
alright alright let's see if we get 20

---------09:13----------
volts now

---------09:26----------
now we're getting 20 volts and 1.3 AM is

---------09:29----------
taken it looks like that chip had some

---------09:30----------
corrosion under it and right after

---------09:32----------
giving me a chip a good ol reflow with

---------09:33----------
some happy authentic Amtech NC 5 v 9 v 2

---------09:36----------
TF flux even get on stored on Ross Magoo

---------09:38----------
calm it now works look at that when we

---------09:43----------
were flowed the chip using a quick 861

---------09:45----------
DW also available on store dot Rossman

---------09:47----------
group comm and if you need one of those

---------09:48----------
chips just because yours doesn't work

---------09:50----------
anymore in a reflow wasn't able to fix

---------09:52----------
it we also sell CD 32 15s this c00

---------09:55----------
version of the bo3 version that's not

---------09:57----------
going to work properly on this board on

---------09:58----------
stored out Rossmann group.com shilling

---------10:02----------
that's how we plan on paying for a new

---------10:04----------
store so this board is now working its

---------10:07----------
board is now able to request 20 vaults

---------10:10----------
from the charger rather than five I'm

---------10:15----------
just gonna ultrasonic it to make sure

---------10:16----------
that there's no liquid damage hiding

---------10:17----------
anywhere where I can't see it touch up a

---------10:19----------
couple of those points and we'll be good

---------10:20----------
to go see what we can do around then

---------10:23----------
make that capacitor a happy Kappa sitter

---------10:38----------
let's see is there a pad down there

---------10:40----------
anymore or is that totally ripped in

---------10:42----------
this great job if there's no pad

---------10:46----------
underneath that capacitor anymore it's

---------10:47----------
been loaned so let's see if we can

---------10:50----------
replace that capacitor hmm these buttons

---------10:52----------
don't seem to be working right anymore I

---------10:56----------
got to get fix the buttons on my

---------10:58----------
microscope camera later

---------11:08----------
okay we're just gonna make a new solder

---------11:10----------
pad out of what used to be the trace see

---------11:15----------
that an ambassador dies together as

---------11:19----------
trace there whoa nice catch girl you

---------11:31----------
want another one

---------11:33----------
wait this Duncan

---------11:55----------
Theresa is best moderators Jennifer

---------11:59----------
she is a quality moderator and we highly

---------12:01----------
appreciate her work

---------12:15----------
now we have some places to actually put

---------12:16----------
that capacitor I miss an issue having a

---------12:24----------
dog

---------12:26----------
we told the your logic board is dead she

---------12:29----------
went wrong and then we said it's a

---------12:31----------
retinas so those are more expensive my

---------12:38----------
[ __ ] wire just moved

---------12:52----------
all righty the mother flower

---------13:59----------
all right that's it for today see you in

---------14:02----------
the next one

---------14:03----------
thank you very much for watching
