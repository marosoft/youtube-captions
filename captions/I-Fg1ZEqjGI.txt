---------00:00----------
okay so today I'm gonna be working on a

---------00:01----------
board that is also for mr. Darby so the

---------00:04----------
last video I was after editing and

---------00:07----------
everything it was I think the whole

---------00:09----------
process was about two and a half three

---------00:10----------
hours I edited it down to two and that

---------00:12----------
is with my with my editing style where I

---------00:15----------
don't edit out a lot so this is gonna be

---------00:17----------
the other board that he brought in he

---------00:19----------
asked me again so somebody who's taking

---------00:21----------
the class this summer and he asked if I

---------00:23----------
would do a video of his board repairs so

---------00:26----------
this one has an issue where you plug the

---------00:29----------
charger and I'm gonna show you right now

---------00:30----------
what happens you plug the charger in you

---------00:33----------
don't get a green light and you get this

---------00:34----------
blinking voltage so let me just

---------00:37----------
show you what I mean when I say blinking

---------00:39----------
voltage

---------00:40----------
so it's plugged in the Dragons

---------00:43----------
oscilloscope over here so that you can

---------00:45----------
get an idea what's going on with it I'm

---------00:51----------
not gonna zoom because I still am sick

---------00:54----------
and I want to avoid getting up and

---------00:55----------
seeing myself as often as possible so I

---------01:00----------
do this I do this see that it's oh it's

---------01:04----------
there oh it's not oh it's there oh it's

---------01:06----------
not oh it's there oh it's not all those

---------01:07----------
little spikes that's not supposed to be

---------01:09----------
spiking that's supposed to be a clean 18

---------01:11----------
point 5 volts and when i look and i i've

---------01:15----------
myself a little nuts for a short period

---------01:17----------
of time and then i look by the charging

---------01:20----------
area and let's see what I see you know

---------01:27----------
but do you know oh look the diode is

---------01:31----------
missing see that where's my tweezers so

---------01:36----------
this little here is supposed to be

---------01:40----------
sitting over there now let me show you

---------01:43----------
what that thing is for and what that

---------01:45----------
thing does so that's this

---------01:51----------
d69 10 and d69 10 is this now I'm gonna

---------01:58----------
be honest with you I don't know what

---------02:01----------
that's for

---------02:02----------
and you can laugh and you can say that

---------02:04----------
I'm dumb and that I don't understand

---------02:06----------
electronics theory and the dumbass

---------02:08----------
college dropout is clueless but one of

---------02:11----------
the things that yeah that uh my first

---------02:14----------
boss Sam fields told me was you know I

---------02:19----------
am never afraid to admit to the world

---------02:21----------
just how stupid I am and I asked him

---------02:24----------
because I had asked him how he knew or

---------02:25----------
certain things that he knew because he

---------02:27----------
knew a ridiculous me just had a lot of

---------02:29----------
information in his head you know there

---------02:31----------
was there was a lot of stuff that he was

---------02:32----------
wrong on but there was also a ridiculous

---------02:34----------
amount that he was right on and he just

---------02:36----------
had a really good well-rounded set of

---------02:39----------
information in his head and he said

---------02:42----------
everything I learned in life is because

---------02:44----------
I was never afraid to admit just how

---------02:46----------
stupid I am they got all these people

---------02:49----------
running around saying trying to pretend

---------02:51----------
that they know more than they actually

---------02:52----------
know and here's the thing nobody nobody

---------02:56----------
really wants to teach you something or

---------02:58----------
nobody's gonna try to show you something

---------02:59----------
if you act like you already know the

---------03:01----------
answer

---------03:02----------
because if you already know the answer

---------03:03----------
the one with somebody else give you the

---------03:05----------
answer you understand so I'm always fine

---------03:08----------
I don't care who knows that I don't know

---------03:10----------
something I don't give a crap what other

---------03:11----------
people think of me you can have those

---------03:16----------
people that look I can't believe you

---------03:17----------
make money when you don't even know the

---------03:19----------
purpose that a circuit I don't know what

---------03:22----------
half of this thing is for honestly when

---------03:23----------
I look at this and I know that like a

---------03:25----------
month from now and I really look into

---------03:27----------
this and I try to figure out how it

---------03:28----------
works that I'm gonna laugh I'm gonna

---------03:29----------
laugh at this but when I look at this

---------03:30----------
right here I don't I don't understand I

---------03:35----------
don't get it and it's just it is what it

---------03:38----------
is I'll figure it out eventually and

---------03:40----------
when I do I'll happily explain it here

---------03:42----------
but at this particular point in time I

---------03:45----------
don't know what the hell half of that

---------03:46----------
 is for but what I do know is that

---------03:50----------
it's missing and because it's missing

---------03:53----------
because it's not on the board I'm gonna

---------03:55----------
put it on the board and wants to put it

---------03:57----------
on the board we're gonna see how we're

---------03:59----------
gonna oh god I'm tired of being sick you

---------04:03----------
just see what happens to it

---------04:05----------
so first things first

---------04:14----------
add some solder added some salt they're

---------04:19----------
not solder you know I can't bring myself

---------04:23----------
to say solder and I want you know I

---------04:25----------
don't know how the right way to say it

---------04:27----------
is but I do know that even if it is the

---------04:30----------
right way to say it is with an L that

---------04:32----------
I'd rather just keep saying it the wrong

---------04:34----------
way because that is just I just can't

---------04:40----------
bring myself to say it that way so that

---------04:52----------
little just ran away and is gone so

---------04:57----------
now here's the part where we we go home

---------04:59----------
we find another one and this is our last

---------05:09----------
remaining one so no losing it

---------05:21----------
this is really damn small this is

---------05:37----------
ridiculously small I mean I don't know

---------05:46----------
what the orientation is in the of the

---------05:48----------
other one that's why I'm taking a new

---------05:49----------
one it's stick

---------06:05----------
Euan plays little diode okay now that

---------06:11----------
little diode is in place let's see if we

---------06:14----------
have an improvement in the results when

---------06:16----------
I connect the charger so now when I

---------06:19----------
connect the charger I have a light

---------06:22----------
before I did not have a light you can't

---------06:25----------
see the light because of the crappy

---------06:27----------
lighting in this room but that is what

---------06:30----------
it is so we're gonna reconnect this and

---------06:32----------
let's see how much of it works again I

---------06:35----------
like to do this in stages I don't want

---------06:38----------
to reconnect everything I don't want to

---------06:40----------
drive myself nuts before I see that

---------06:42----------
something actually works so what I'm

---------06:44----------
gonna do here is I'm gonna plug the fan

---------06:45----------
in and see if the fan spins so the fan

---------06:57----------
here spins so now I'm gonna reconnect

---------07:00----------
everything and see if it works now you

---------07:02----------
may be wondering at this point am I

---------07:04----------
gonna be charging my standard board

---------07:06----------
repair rate even though all I did to fix

---------07:08----------
this was replace one component that took

---------07:11----------
me about 20 seconds and the answer to

---------07:14----------
that is yes because the last one

---------07:16----------
over here did the same gentleman sent me

---------07:19----------
very nice guy I spent 3 hours on it and

---------07:22----------
I videotaped every damn second to that

---------07:24----------
misery and I can't bill a single dollar

---------07:27----------
for it not only did I spend two and a

---------07:30----------
half to three hours of my time on it but

---------07:32----------
it also has a $35 chip on it that I'm

---------07:35----------
not gonna take off because the time it's

---------07:37----------
gonna take to put that take that off and

---------07:38----------
reball the old one and put that back on

---------07:40----------
is not even worth the $30 so this

---------07:44----------
hopefully gives you a better idea of how

---------07:46----------
the billing structuring works here again

---------07:48----------
did this board get fixed in no joke 30

---------07:51----------
seconds yes and I'm gonna charge fool

---------07:54----------
for it because when I spent 2 or 3 hours

---------07:56----------
and 30 bucks on parts on something that

---------07:57----------
I cannot build for I do not bill for it

---------08:00----------
and I'm not gonna break this thing out

---------08:02----------
of spite send it back to him like in

---------08:03----------
stabbed and say you because I

---------08:06----------
didn't get to get paid for it I'm just

---------08:08----------
gonna send it back in here whatever it

---------08:09----------
doesn't charge the battery it's better

---------08:11----------
than it was before

---------08:11----------
enjoy

---------08:14----------
so we're gonna put this back together

---------08:15----------
and see if it works what do you want I

---------08:17----------
figure I should give you a little bit

---------08:18----------
more of an idea of what that circuit

---------08:20----------
does even if I'm not totally up on every

---------08:23----------
part of it I know enough to get an idea

---------08:25----------
so the whole idea here is this is

---------08:30----------
voltage from the charger right and this

---------08:33----------
voltage from the charger right over here

---------08:34----------
this firstly you have the one wire

---------08:35----------
circuit here you know what that is we've

---------08:37----------
talked about it a billion times which is

---------08:39----------
powered off pp 3 V 4 2 this is the pp 3

---------08:42----------
V 4 2 power supply in order for the pp 3

---------08:44----------
V 4 to power supply over here to get

---------08:47----------
input from the charger it needs for this

---------08:53----------
transistor to open C so this is the

---------08:55----------
input over here of the pp 3 before to

---------08:58----------
power supply this is the power from the

---------09:00----------
charger and it's gonna open through this

---------09:03----------
transistor based on the power that's

---------09:05----------
present at the gate now if there's no

---------09:08----------
path over here because this diode is

---------09:10----------
missing then you're not going to wind up

---------09:14----------
with the right voltage on the gate and

---------09:17----------
again why a diode is here instead of

---------09:20----------
something else and what this does maybe

---------09:24----------
I'm just an idiot Alette electronics

---------09:25----------
maybe it's the 103 fever maybe it's

---------09:28----------
because I don't work on this board very

---------09:29----------
often I don't know but when I do figure

---------09:33----------
it out or feel better I'll be happy to

---------09:34----------
discuss it in in another video oh right

---------09:43----------
now I'm just about ready to finish up

---------09:46----------
this and something else

---------09:47----------
and head home and pet my cat and sit

---------09:52----------
under a blanket until next week oh by

---------10:06----------
the way

---------10:06----------
another problem there's a screw that is

---------10:09----------
not magnetic on this machine that you

---------10:12----------
need in order for the battery to get

---------10:14----------
grounded to the computer and mr. Darby

---------10:17----------
sir I'm sorry to tell you that you lost

---------10:19----------
that screw it's it's it was noted the

---------10:22----------
first thing is when this machine got

---------10:24----------
checked in and that is that sucks

---------10:27----------
because I don't have spares of that and

---------10:29----------
there is nothing I can do to help you on

---------10:31----------
that matter this is a really really

---------10:33----------
stupidly designed machine so they have

---------10:35----------
this little cube here and this

---------10:39----------
cube allows the battery to attach to the

---------10:42----------
board with these 40 50 30 whatever

---------10:45----------
little stupid contacts and then there's

---------10:47----------
also a large screw that grounds the

---------10:49----------
battery to the board it really is dumb

---------10:51----------
there's no reason to not have a

---------10:52----------
connector that simply latches and clicks

---------10:55----------
on like every other laptop on earth and

---------10:57----------
every other Apple laptop that's been

---------10:58----------
made for the past six years they just

---------11:00----------
decided I guess every now and then they

---------11:02----------
decide to do some stupid for no

---------11:03----------
reason they corrected it with the a 1502

---------11:05----------
remnant but this one does that and it's

---------11:09----------
it's really stupid

---------11:10----------
it makes no sense I know that you

---------11:13----------
probably keep good care of your screws

---------11:15----------
you just lost this one because it's not

---------11:17----------
magnetic that's another thing that's

---------11:18----------
really dumb you know it's like if this

---------11:21----------
is an iphone we have a GPS and

---------11:24----------
you have to worry about the magnet being

---------11:26----------
here the GPS chip or anything like that

---------11:28----------
it's just it's just it's just a dumb

---------11:32----------
thing and it sucks to lose it so it

---------11:42----------
find one I willing that I can spare for

---------11:44----------
you I'll include it in the box if I

---------11:47----------
don't find one that will be your

---------11:48----------
adventure to find a screw yeah this is

---------12:03----------
the eighth to zero 3462 board which is

---------12:06----------
one of the most miserable ones to put

---------12:09----------
back together because of all the little

---------12:10----------
nooks and crannies and especially the

---------12:15----------
stupid battery

---------12:48----------
I would hope that in particular you

---------12:49----------
don't have the problem with this machine

---------12:51----------
of issues running off of the battery

---------12:52----------
since if I can't find you a spare screw

---------12:56----------
there isn't really much I can do in

---------12:58----------
terms of testing that for you I guess I

---------13:06----------
could do something silly like sod or

---------13:08----------
something on the board but there's no

---------13:13----------
reason to do anything silly just yet

---------13:19----------
alrighty so back to showing you what's

---------13:22----------
going on here so as you can see I am

---------13:28----------
booted into an operating system again

---------13:30----------
this guy's trackpad doesn't work so I

---------13:33----------
had to attach this one and you can see

---------13:36----------
the mouse is moving around so this was

---------13:38----------
totally dead not turning on the first

---------13:40----------
issue that we had with it was that

---------13:42----------
little diode was missing so instead of

---------13:44----------
getting a consistent seventeen point

---------13:46----------
four volts in the DC and rail we were

---------13:48----------
getting 17 0 17 0 17 and 0 and the

---------13:51----------
computers not going to turn on and it's

---------13:53----------
not going to do anything if you have 17

---------13:55----------
and 0 nothing and this is gonna turn on

---------13:57----------
no power rails are going to turn on and

---------13:58----------
actually do anything the second problem

---------14:00----------
that we have is this guy's trackpad is

---------14:02----------
keeping it from working at all and that

---------14:05----------
that's gonna be your problem along with

---------14:07----------
finding that little battery screw that

---------14:09----------
you lost I'd even give you 105 I could

---------14:12----------
buy one but you can't buy one so you

---------14:15----------
really have to go back on your desk and

---------14:16----------
find where you left that little screw

---------14:18----------
and I know again I know exactly how you

---------14:20----------
lost it you lost it because it's not

---------14:22----------
magnetic and it sucks but oh well what

---------14:26----------
can i what can I do for you it works
