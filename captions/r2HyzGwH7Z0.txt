---------00:00----------
I just took out my hot Weezer's and he

---------00:02----------
goes it's almost like I'm preparing to

---------00:06----------
stab somebody like there's someone

---------00:12----------
behind me in the office that refuses to

---------00:14----------
go away hey everybody how's it going so

---------00:16----------
today we've got an 8 1502 MacBook Pro

---------00:18----------
from 2015

---------00:19----------
that's not turning on let's see if we

---------00:21----------
can open this thing up and figure out

---------00:22----------
what's wrong with it and make it work

---------00:24----------
again so first thing I'm gonna do here

---------00:26----------
is get the desk camera on here so you

---------00:27----------
can see this MacBook we've cleaned this

---------00:29----------
MacBook off so it is 99.97%

---------00:32----------
coronavirus free that's right with a

---------00:34----------
microfiber cloth and some alcohol we've

---------00:36----------
got some UV bulbs in the way as well so

---------00:38----------
we're gonna UV these things we're gonna

---------00:39----------
alcohol these things above all we're

---------00:42----------
gonna stare at them really mean ly which

---------00:43----------
I'm sure is gonna scare all the bacteria

---------00:45----------
and viruses away now first thing that

---------00:47----------
we're gonna do over here is turn on the

---------00:49----------
multimeter and power supply software so

---------00:51----------
that you can see how much amperage is

---------00:53----------
taking on the screen because when you

---------00:55----------
know how much amperage is taking it'll

---------00:57----------
give you a bit of an idea of what may be

---------00:59----------
wrong with it so first thing to do here

---------01:01----------
is that my power supply to nineteen

---------01:02----------
point five volts plug that thing and

---------01:05----------
turn it on and how much power are we

---------01:08----------
using so it looks like we're using 239

---------01:11----------
milliamps we're getting a light in the

---------01:13----------
charge I mean in the SMC is turning on

---------01:14----------
SMC is communicating with the charger

---------01:17----------
but the 230 milliamp s' is very very

---------01:20----------
strange typically this would be taking

---------01:22----------
something closer to five or six hundred

---------01:24----------
milliamps if it's turning on 23 to 24

---------01:26----------
million if it was an issue with p.m.

---------01:28----------
sleep best 4 L missing 100 200 milliamps

---------01:31----------
if it was an all says power good issue

---------01:32----------
50 to 60 milliamps if there's an issue

---------01:34----------
around the TPS 5 1 9 8 0 this is strange

---------01:38----------
I'm gonna take a guess that is a short 2

---------01:40----------
grounds on PB but g3 huh done one way to

---------01:42----------
find out so let's open this thing up

---------01:44----------
let's see if we can figure out what's

---------01:46----------
wrong with it

---------01:53----------
Massimo says hello from Italy are you

---------01:56----------
the one that left me to figure one star

---------01:57----------
review today on Yelp oh man you got to

---------02:00----------
see the quality of fake reviews that

---------02:02----------
I've been getting ah if there's anything

---------02:04----------
that I love about Yelp it's all the real

---------02:06----------
reviews from actual customers that have

---------02:08----------
invoiced there in my there they are in

---------02:11----------
my merchant services system that got

---------02:13----------
their name all that stuff those reviews

---------02:16----------
filtered then someone says that I

---------02:19----------
literally physically tossed them out of

---------02:21----------
the store for the crime of being Italian

---------02:23----------
then what does he help say to that

---------02:25----------
review that one stays up yep no fact

---------02:30----------
that I'm Italian doesn't really matter

---------02:34----------
what I do do is I have equal opportunity

---------02:37----------
and spraying all the people that show up

---------02:38----------
with alcohol I have been spraying every

---------02:41----------
any time people stay in an area a little

---------02:42----------
too long I spray them with alcohol all

---------02:45----------
the people coming in just pop pop pop

---------02:46----------
pop pop you all get sprayed with alcohol

---------02:53----------
all right so you got a couple of things

---------02:56----------
that are strange here you that's a green

---------03:07----------
hair next to what looks to be Corona all

---------03:18----------
right so let's take the mighty - mighty

---------03:20----------
q-tip alcohol dispenser can you get me a

---------03:28----------
refill alcohol bottle thanks Lois he is

---------03:38----------
a sicko I tried it up years ago all

---------03:44----------
right let's I'm gonna wash the corona

---------03:46----------
off that corona doesn't want to come off

---------03:49----------
though that's some tough Corona

---------04:09----------
now I'm burning for the corona and

---------04:11----------
making it airborne

---------04:32----------
[Applause]

---------04:39----------
mmm can you smell that

---------04:43----------
you smell that rotting Corona yeah

---------04:47----------
nice isn't it

---------05:07----------
keyboard backlight is obviously gonna

---------05:09----------
need to be replaced before we even get

---------05:13----------
to keyboard backlight let's just see if

---------05:14----------
there's any more Corona

---------05:22----------
burn it away that's what I'm trying to

---------05:24----------
do who spilled stuff in their computers

---------05:28----------
you do probably since I've had Simic

---------05:32----------
tooth spill stuff in his computers

---------05:35----------
that's why he is audio I see doesn't

---------05:37----------
work so I couldn't really read that

---------05:39----------
twitchchat nine seconds ago

---------05:48----------
okay next

---------05:50----------
so let's see if removing of that removal

---------05:52----------
of that Corona gets it to turn on

---------06:05----------
all right so now we're down to 119

---------06:07----------
mallams strange a little bit of

---------06:12----------
estimating estimation estimations is is

---------06:18----------
our pp bus presence where is the pp bus

---------06:23----------
12 point 51 volts what do you know we

---------06:26----------
have a pp bus

---------06:27----------
next up the microscope light is

---------06:31----------
flickering I need microscope light is

---------06:35----------
not like what I've been doing to it 5

---------06:38----------
volts on the p25 es5 3 balls in the pp 3

---------06:49----------
v 3s 3

---------06:49----------
I mean Phoebe 3 V 3 is 5 thanks for

---------06:51----------
being online then Rose why Mac books are

---------06:52----------
not waterproof except for Apple Apple is

---------06:55----------
a reason in and of itself mr. Rousillon

---------06:57----------
and thank you as always

---------06:59----------
BP 5 vs 4 5 volts all right so we're in

---------07:03----------
that's for a state we're out of the most

---------07:04----------
difficult part of the race here you have

---------07:07----------
a little bit of corrosion up here but

---------07:09----------
it's barely noticeable and it's for this

---------07:10----------
is for screen stuff I don't care about

---------07:12----------
the screen you don't even turn on yet

---------07:17----------
this is okay you know we're gonna remove

---------07:20----------
that backlight connector

---------07:21----------
Paul Daniels is in the chances Andre

---------07:23----------
how's it going mr. Paul Daniels I'm glad

---------07:26----------
to hear that you're still here and

---------07:27----------
hopefully Corona free I hope you're

---------07:31----------
doing well Paul the best for you and

---------07:33----------
your family

---------07:44----------
everybody say hello to mr. Paul Daniels

---------07:46----------
in the chat today he is an esteemed

---------07:50----------
guest

---------07:56----------
with esteem highest

---------08:01----------
[Music]

---------08:04----------
Paul Daniels provides the software that

---------08:06----------
keeps the repair community go

---------09:26----------
I'm glad to hear that Paul Daniels is

---------09:28----------
essential I find him to be essential

---------09:31----------
myself without someone to blame for my

---------09:35----------
screw-ups

---------09:35----------
I would probably sit in a corner and cry

---------09:37----------
unable to have the confidence to

---------09:39----------
continue moving forward with my work or

---------09:42----------
my day

---------09:48----------
Paul Daniels provides the essential

---------09:50----------
service of being a pinata the roster no

---------09:53----------
parent

---------10:06----------
I don't know what you're talking about

---------10:07----------
goes right

---------10:39----------
all right so what we did here is we

---------10:41----------
removed the backlight connector for the

---------10:44----------
keyboard so most likely he had a short

---------10:46----------
to ground on one of the rails that goes

---------10:48----------
to the keyboard backlight connector so

---------10:50----------
let's take a look at what that rail is

---------10:51----------
and Paul Daniels is amazing software

---------10:53----------
called flex board view that you can

---------10:54----------
purchase over at PL Daniel's com that's

---------10:57----------
PL Daniels com

---------11:09----------
now if you take a look over here you'll

---------11:11----------
notice that the machine likely was

---------11:13----------
shorting ppv out s Oh keyboard backlight

---------11:15----------
to ground as a result of that connector

---------11:18----------
being destroy so we had an SL power line

---------11:19----------
that was shorted to ground this is why

---------11:23----------
we're taking 200 milliamps because we

---------11:24----------
had all the s5s as fours as threes g3

---------11:26----------
hots but we were missing this now if you

---------11:29----------
take a look at where this comes from

---------11:30----------
this is going to come from over here

---------11:44----------
now this chip is powered by PP v ESO so

---------11:48----------
most likely PP v ESO was shorted to

---------11:50----------
ground through the LED driver

---------11:53----------
interesting and that is what most likely

---------11:56----------
caused our fault

---------11:57----------
now the fun part of this is going to be

---------11:59----------
putting a new connector on the board

---------12:01----------
because out that is a nasty looking area

---------12:09----------
that is disgusting that sounded like a

---------12:17----------
sword

---------12:18----------
did you guys hear that let me try that

---------12:19----------
again that just drew my sword I just

---------12:24----------
took out my heart tweezers anything goes

---------12:28----------
it's almost like I'm preparing to stab

---------12:30----------
somebody like there's someone behind me

---------12:35----------
in the office that refuses to go away

---------12:46----------
I wonder what's gonna happen a Corona

---------12:47----------
beer after all of this because there

---------12:49----------
obviously there's no easy way out for

---------12:51----------
them if they keep their name that's a

---------12:53----------
really negative association that some

---------12:54----------
people's heads and branding for a long

---------12:56----------
time if they don't keep their name they

---------12:58----------
lose all the brand recognition so

---------12:59----------
they're gonna have to put in a bunch of

---------13:00----------
money into getting people to like a new

---------13:01----------
brand

---------13:12----------
do you still remember that recent

---------13:15----------
macbook repair you go to hell and you

---------13:18----------
die along with that stream of that

---------13:20----------
terrible MacBook repair no we've

---------13:25----------
forgotten about it

---------13:30----------
it was learned his lesson to not be

---------13:32----------
stupid hey I'm just saying that that

---------13:35----------
works it worked

---------13:39----------
it will likely continue to work into the

---------13:41----------
future

---------13:51----------
now I have to find a board that has that

---------13:53----------
back light connector still on it all

---------13:58----------
right you guys enjoying crotch cam over

---------14:00----------
there

---------14:21----------
where the other 18 Colvin's

---------14:28----------
Apple stock

---------15:35----------
let's see how a hot air would actually

---------15:37----------
settle this into place oh cool I took a

---------15:42----------
resistor off with it

---------15:43----------
isn't that something all right let's see

---------15:46----------
so let's make a bet you guys think hot

---------15:49----------
air at a low enough temperature would

---------15:51----------
settle this in a place without melting

---------15:52----------
the plastic want me to find out right

---------17:12----------
[Applause]

---------17:17----------
you should let the backlight connector

---------17:19----------
off pitch it as a feature to stop people

---------17:20----------
seeing what you write at night

---------17:22----------
yeah like when I

---------17:29----------
like if somebody has tape on their

---------17:31----------
webcam and I accidentally [ __ ] up their

---------17:33----------
assembly or I screw up the webcam cable

---------17:35----------
and I say hey good news I noticed that

---------17:37----------
you had a piece of tape on your webcam

---------17:38----------
well it actually doesn't really look

---------17:40----------
very appealing with the MacBook you know

---------17:42----------
it kind of takes away from the appeal of

---------17:44----------
the nice body that it has so what I did

---------17:46----------
is I actually disabled it in the

---------17:47----------
hardware for you so that nobody can get

---------17:49----------
to it the NSA the FBI the CIA nobody

---------17:53----------
will be able to remove you use your

---------17:54----------
webcam and I can get rid of this little

---------17:55----------
piece of tape what do you think oh

---------17:56----------
really you can do that absolutely and

---------17:59----------
you're not gonna charge me extra and

---------18:01----------
that's the point where I died a little

---------18:02----------
bit inside because somebody's actually

---------18:03----------
expected me to charge them extra for

---------18:05----------
breaking information

---------18:11----------
that's not really a thing anymore but in

---------18:14----------
the days of the there were there were

---------18:16----------
the olden days where you could actually

---------18:17----------
mess up the webcam cable easily removing

---------18:20----------
the screen it's not a thing anymore that

---------18:26----------
was the first thing I actually blew up

---------18:27----------
in a Mac corner my first macbook repair

---------18:29----------
ever was an a 1150 that needed a screen

---------18:31----------
and I actually set the webcam cable on

---------18:34----------
fire that was the first thing I ever

---------18:36----------
fixed

---------18:41----------
I mean that was a machine that I had

---------18:43----------
bought for myself and I thought I'm yep

---------18:46----------
I'm gonna save some money

---------18:56----------
the quality of a webcam has not really

---------18:58----------
gone up in the past ten years

---------19:33----------
Apple is non-essential Luis isn't oh you

---------19:37----------
know I don't want to brag or anything

---------20:18----------
all right I feel good about that this on

---------20:21----------
the other hand what the hell is this

---------20:23----------
piece of [ __ ] doing stuck to this

---------20:26----------
freaking resistor

---------20:37----------
[Applause]

---------20:40----------
that's our backlight connector isn't it

---------20:42----------
pretty

---------20:43----------
it's pretty isn't it

---------20:51----------
and when it's plugged in takes 500

---------20:57----------
milliamps

---------20:59----------
just get this camera off of crotch cam

---------21:02----------
now

---------21:14----------
this is gonna need a new keyboard

---------21:15----------
backlight obviously so we'll have to

---------21:19----------
install a new keyboard backlight for

---------21:21----------
this customer which jumper wire size

---------21:23----------
will do for most jobs

---------21:25----------
yeah 44 gauge is what I use for most of

---------21:30----------
the stuff if it's for a powerline that

---------21:32----------
has to be long then I'll use a 38 around

---------21:36----------
there or you could just double or triple

---------21:38----------
up on the 44 now essential with

---------21:48----------
everybody here today I hope you're all

---------21:51----------
feeling very essential I hope every last

---------21:56----------
one of you understands what it's like to

---------21:57----------
be essential I hope you all understand

---------22:03----------
what what gamestop feels like right now

---------22:05----------
GameStop is essential if gamestop is

---------22:09----------
essential then I'm essential there's

---------22:10----------
there's no way around that

---------22:23----------
dah dah look at that delaminated screen

---------22:26----------
right there so that's about it we were

---------22:33----------
not having this turn on was taking more

---------22:35----------
milliamps than I expected not less for a

---------22:37----------
machine that was dead and that was

---------22:39----------
because we had a short to ground on the

---------22:40----------
backlight and instead of there being a

---------22:42----------
current sensing circuit or a fuse that

---------22:43----------
blows this is an apple if anything

---------22:47----------
happens to your keyboard backlight

---------22:48----------
circuit you don't have a computer

---------22:50----------
anymore ah MacBook so that's it for

---------22:55----------
today and as always I hope you learned

---------22:56----------
something thank you so much for watching

---------22:58----------
thank you so much for taking part in

---------22:59----------
what word is that we're doing stay safe

---------23:01----------
stay healthy clean your face wash your

---------23:03----------
hands clean your PP bus and I'll see you

---------23:04----------
all in the next video bye now
