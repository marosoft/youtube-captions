---------00:00----------
all right next machine moving on to an a

---------00:02----------
50 no 2 MacBook that will not turn on as

---------00:05----------
you can see like many of the other Mac

---------00:07----------
books I work on this one is completely

---------00:09----------
covered and plastered in dirt that has

---------00:11----------
never been cleaned by the end user such

---------00:13----------
as life you don't have a spinning fan

---------00:15----------
and it's drawing no power from my power

---------00:18----------
supply I never understood that wiping

---------00:20----------
down your machine is so easy says Rick

---------00:21----------
Vandermark nope it's not because if you

---------00:23----------
do that the screen will peel off if I

---------00:25----------
told you about stain gate check this out

---------00:27----------
you think that you can simply wipe down

---------00:29----------
your screen nope no that's what happens

---------00:34----------
if you wipe down your screen that yeah

---------00:38----------
you're so silly you think you can just

---------00:40----------
clean your screen if there's dirt on it

---------00:42----------
you're cleaning it wrong you're touching

---------00:46----------
it wrong you're staring at it wrong this

---------00:48----------
is what happens if you clean your Apple

---------00:50----------
product look at that look at that isn't

---------00:54----------
that beautiful that's what we call stain

---------00:56----------
gate and stain gate is why you can't

---------01:00----------
clean your macbook you need to make sure

---------01:03----------
that your MacBook stays ugly you know

---------01:05----------
the one thing I would say is if you're

---------01:06----------
buying this thing you're probably

---------01:07----------
spending your money wrong you're buying

---------01:09----------
it wrong is what Becky says definitely

---------01:11----------
buying it wrong corrosion on webcam

---------01:15----------
connector dust on jtag connector

---------01:31----------
we've completed removing the dust from

---------01:34----------
the MacBook you want to take our

---------01:36----------
connector and take our power and put it

---------01:40----------
there and turn the charger on damn no

---------01:44----------
fan spin that would have been way too

---------01:46----------
easy

---------01:46----------
Oh huh what are you oh I found you

---------01:51----------
corrosion mm-hmm go away corrosion

---------02:13----------
[Music]

---------02:24----------
okay where else did the corrosion go I'm

---------02:27----------
hungry for corrosion show me some more I

---------02:32----------
want to get as much as I can under the

---------02:34----------
microscope before I toss this in the

---------02:35----------
cleaner you want to touch up any joints

---------02:38----------
that are messed up that shouldn't be

---------02:40----------
here that gross crap huh

---------02:57----------
we got no spin I'm gonna give this a go

---------03:02----------
in the ultrasonic and see if that

---------03:04----------
doesn't this is a board for the cleaner

---------03:06----------
I will start troubleshooting it once

---------03:08----------
it's clean god forbid a $1000 product

---------03:10----------
gets any level of dust resistance yeah

---------03:13----------
that's Apple this is the machine that I

---------03:15----------
just took out of the ultrasonic cleaner

---------03:17----------
this is the one where we were that was

---------03:19----------
filled with dust that I removed the jtag

---------03:21----------
connector on and this is what it looks

---------03:25----------
like now so you can see that it looks a

---------03:29----------
lot cleaner this is the webcam this is

---------03:34----------
the webcam over here connector and this

---------03:37----------
is where the JTAG was I had a lot of

---------03:39----------
flux of that area and removed it it

---------03:40----------
cleaned it pretty nicely pretty nicely

---------03:42----------
and if we look at the other side of the

---------03:44----------
board you can see right where I was

---------03:48----------
doing some touch-up soldering the crest

---------03:51----------
managed to clean that off pretty well

---------03:53----------
remember this board did not work when I

---------03:56----------
touched up the soldering in all those

---------03:58----------
areas that had funny looking stuff yeah

---------04:04----------
but the the crest did a really good job

---------04:06----------
of cleaning all the junk off of this

---------04:08----------
board and now we're gonna try to turn it

---------04:11----------
on and I'm really hoping that this

---------04:12----------
doesn't turn on because if this does

---------04:14----------
turn on now that means that you can kill

---------04:16----------
a $1,299 professional product from Apple

---------04:20----------
with dust and lint and that would be

---------04:24----------
painful that would be a hard pill to

---------04:26----------
swallow so we're gonna plug it in and as

---------04:30----------
you can see there is fan spin that fan

---------04:34----------
spin means that you can kill a $1,299

---------04:37----------
professional level machine from Apple

---------04:39----------
with dust that is all it takes ladies

---------04:44----------
and gentlemen that is all it takes

---------04:45----------
that's one of those things to think

---------04:47----------
about before you spend twelve hundred

---------04:48----------
ninety nine dollars on one of their

---------04:49----------
products

---------04:50----------
oh man that's sad that is so sad that is

---------04:54----------
so sad engineered in Cupertino

---------04:57----------
California that was can we even call

---------05:03----------
that corrosion with how small it was and

---------05:05----------
you can see that I removed every bit of

---------05:08----------
corrosion from the board because I know

---------05:09----------
the art

---------05:10----------
one's gonna be well lilies davis

---------05:11----------
corrosion there okay well we went over

---------05:13----------
the board with a microscope 45 x baby 45

---------05:17----------
x microscope we removed every piece of

---------05:19----------
corrosion and ree soldered any

---------05:21----------
connection that had even this much

---------05:23----------
corrosion and in my experience that much

---------05:25----------
corrosion is not going to do it you need

---------05:27----------
like this much corrosion not that much

---------05:29----------
corrosion which means that what was

---------05:32----------
causing this to not work was probably

---------05:34----------
not the corrosion it was the dust yeah

---------05:45----------
i'm gonna be paying my rent here for a

---------05:46----------
long time into the future i can tell
