---------00:00----------
here we ever a 15-hour to retina it

---------00:02----------
doesn't turn off just try and find out

---------00:04----------
why it doesn't turn on now let's take a

---------00:06----------
look at this back let me take a look at

---------00:07----------
this MacBook you're gonna notice a

---------00:09----------
couple of things first thing you're

---------00:11----------
gonna notice is that this corrosion by

---------00:14----------
the trackpad connector second thing

---------00:16----------
you're gonna notice corrosion by the SMC

---------00:20----------
and the SMC reset ship so we're gonna do

---------00:24----------
a couple of measurements here the first

---------00:25----------
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

---------00:27----------
plug in the charger and I'm going to see

---------00:29----------
what our pp bus measures now remember

---------00:31----------
pp bus g3 hot here's a power rail

---------00:34----------
created by the ISL 6259

---------00:36----------
the ISL 65:9 communicates with the SMC

---------00:39----------
in order to set the exact voltage if we

---------00:41----------
have a PP but g3 hot of a point one

---------00:43----------
volts means that SMC communication is

---------00:45----------
not occurring if we have an PP budget

---------00:48----------
III out of eight point five volts it

---------00:49----------
means that SMC communication is

---------00:51----------
occurring the reason it's important to

---------00:52----------
get an idea of whether SMC communication

---------00:54----------
is occurring is because SMC

---------00:55----------
communication is the thing that's going

---------00:58----------
to tell us whether or not the SMC is

---------01:00----------
running and whether or not the SMC is

---------01:01----------
the capability to speak to the charger

---------01:03----------
because getting a green light is a

---------01:04----------
function of the SMC communicating with

---------01:07----------
the charger so we are going to check and

---------01:09----------
see what it is

---------01:10----------
our pp busses on this board and see if

---------01:13----------
we get the low voltage of the high by

---------01:16----------
the way I meant twelve point two verses

---------01:17----------
twelve point five eight point one versus

---------01:19----------
eight point five is for an hour so we're

---------01:20----------
getting twelve point two volts on our pp

---------01:23----------
bus which means that our SMC is not

---------01:24----------
turning on

---------01:25----------
now the SM C could not be turning on or

---------01:28----------
it could be bad and when you look at how

---------01:30----------
much corrosion is by the SMC so the SMC

---------01:33----------
itself could be not turning on or be bad

---------01:36----------
as a result of corrosion or the reset

---------01:38----------
circuit which is supposed to turn the

---------01:40----------
SMC on could not be working now let's

---------01:44----------
take a look at a schematic for an eight

---------01:47----------
to zero 49:24 board and show you what I

---------01:50----------
mean by the SMC reset circuit so this

---------01:52----------
chip over here which seems to be

---------01:54----------
corroded you 5110 by the way available

---------01:57----------
on stored out Rosman group comm is a

---------02:00----------
chip that is going to turn on the SMC

---------02:02----------
there's a signal called SMC reset al

---------02:04----------
this signal is going to tell the SMC

---------02:07----------
that you should turn off when you're low

---------02:10----------
underscore L low

---------02:13----------
at the SMC and turned on when you're

---------02:16----------
high because the envious and the signal

---------02:18----------
will not be present so I present want to

---------02:19----------
flow the purpose of that signal is to

---------02:21----------
ensure that the SMC does not try to turn

---------02:23----------
on until pp3 before two is stable so

---------02:26----------
this chip over here gets PP 3 V 4 2 and

---------02:28----------
as a voltage going into the chip and it

---------02:31----------
tells when that is present once PP 3

---------02:34----------
before 2 has stabilized actually wait

---------02:38----------
does it no it gets PP 3 V 3 s 5 hmm all

---------02:43----------
right so P P 3 V 3 s 5 I believe goes

---------02:45----------
into this now PP 3 before 2 goes in on

---------02:47----------
pin 1 alright nevermind so I'm losing my

---------02:49----------
mind

---------02:50----------
so once PP 3 before - once this voltage

---------02:52----------
here has stabilized then the chip will

---------02:55----------
allow SMC reset l to be released which

---------02:57----------
will allow the SMC to turn on so the

---------02:59----------
whole point is to not turn the SMC on

---------03:01----------
until we arc we have a level in stable p

---------03:05----------
b3 b4 - p b3 b4 - is the power of the

---------03:08----------
SMC runs on and FP p 3 before - is not

---------03:10----------
stable prior to the SMC turning on the

---------03:13----------
SMC will crash with that we're going to

---------03:16----------
see if our pp 3 before - SMC reset all

---------03:20----------
that good stuff is present on this

---------03:22----------
motherboard so the first thing we're

---------03:23----------
gonna do is we're going to check for SMC

---------03:26----------
reset l at the point that we would

---------03:28----------
expect it to be and I'm gonna use paul

---------03:31----------
daniels of software to have it show up

---------03:33----------
on the screen paul daniels is lovely

---------03:36----------
software beautiful software garbage'

---------03:40----------
software then you could find it PL

---------03:42----------
daniels dot-com don't delay

---------03:45----------
check out Paul Daniels software today

---------03:47----------
and it's not present but also this may

---------03:51----------
be all the pads for this resistor are

---------03:52----------
destroyed there I'll see you later

---------03:59----------
Pepa but the bus the bus

---------04:34----------
now the SMC reset chip is been removed

---------04:36----------
from the board hmm now I need to find

---------04:41----------
myself at an SN nine zero three zero

---------04:44----------
four nine

---------04:46----------
that's SN 9 zero three zero four nine

---------04:49----------
where could I find myself an SN nine

---------04:52----------
zero three zero four nine if I needed to

---------04:55----------
purchase one hmm look no further than

---------04:59----------
store dot Rossmann group.com you could

---------05:02----------
find an SMC reset chip for the low low

---------05:04----------
price of 649 free shipping on orders

---------05:07----------
over $30.00 within the continental

---------05:08----------
United States same-day shipping

---------05:10----------
and full knowledge of the products that

---------05:12----------
we sell the description will tell you an

---------05:14----------
idea of when you need that chip the

---------05:17----------
additional information will tell you

---------05:18----------
what boards that's compatible with we

---------05:20----------
have a live chat we have email we have

---------05:22----------
phone support here at store dot Rossman

---------05:24----------
group.com unless you're a please bro

---------05:27----------
don't delay by today so I'm just gonna

---------05:31----------
head over to store down Rossmann grew

---------05:32----------
calm and buy a chip hmm SMC reset

---------05:42----------
hmm much tasty we're gonna put that chip

---------05:47----------
on the board

---------05:57----------
it's just too good to be true that you

---------05:59----------
can go to a sign like store down Rossman

---------06:00----------
Kaoru calm for all your MacBook chip and

---------06:03----------
tool needs I know the excitement is

---------06:09----------
overwhelming you want to go to store

---------06:11----------
down rossmann group calm right now you

---------06:13----------
don't even want to finish this video you

---------06:15----------
want to buy a quick a crest or some

---------06:20----------
chips then more well I know that urge

---------06:22----------
ladies and gentlemen but let me tell you

---------06:24----------
from an unbiased perspective I

---------06:26----------
definitely understand and believe that

---------06:31----------
you should go ahead and fulfill that

---------06:32----------
urge to buy from store dot Rossmann grew

---------06:35----------
calm or to watch our board repair videos

---------06:38----------
on boards dot Rossman group calm

---------08:17----------
appears we still don't have a green

---------08:18----------
light it appears our pp bus is still low

---------08:20----------
in voltage peers are SMC reset signal is

---------08:23----------
actually high now it was low before but

---------08:25----------
a tie now so the next thing it's gonna

---------08:27----------
be wrong with this board that the SMC

---------08:29----------
most likely is not going to be allowing

---------08:31----------
us to get a green light from the charger

---------08:33----------
because it has corrosion under it let's

---------08:34----------
clean that up

---------11:48----------
conservatively between em scopes and

---------11:50----------
other lower end ones then you won't feel

---------11:52----------
sick if you use them ahem scope is the

---------11:55----------
low end honestly at least from what I've

---------11:57----------
seen like the high end or the like is

---------11:59----------
are the vision engineering so well scope

---------12:03----------
is pretty cheap for what you get and

---------12:06----------
yeah hat for me I'm scope it just always

---------12:08----------
appeared to be the low Xcode they I

---------12:11----------
actually have a review that I need to

---------12:13----------
edit and publish for the Leica $1600 one

---------12:15----------
that I really don't understand why

---------12:18----------
somebody would pay for that over in

---------12:19----------
EBSCO

---------12:20----------
[Music]

---------12:32----------
[Music]

---------13:03----------
[Music]

---------13:37----------
yeah and look at that we get a light on

---------13:42----------
the charger

---------13:50----------
you

---------13:58----------
do you have a Macbook that needs to be

---------13:59----------
fixed come by our store which is open to
