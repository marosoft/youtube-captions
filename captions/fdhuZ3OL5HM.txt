---------00:00----------
I said bad cinematography he's a

---------00:01----------
different color than me in video but in

---------00:03----------
real life he's the same color as me this

---------00:07----------
camera actually can ya believe it this

---------00:10----------
camera actually if you do face detection

---------00:11----------
it won't notice black people it's

---------00:14----------
something I feel like bringing up with

---------00:15----------
Saudi focus is when Jake Jake borrowed

---------00:18----------
the camera and we noticed that this

---------00:21----------
camera will not the face detection

---------00:23----------
feature with black people does not work

---------00:25----------
it's so ridiculous yeah so this

---------00:31----------
was turning on a minute ago and since

---------00:33----------
I've touched it it stopped oh boy here

---------00:36----------
we go

---------00:36----------
alright so this is somebody who asked me

---------00:38----------
to replace a screen cable because it

---------00:41----------
does this see well ahem mm well

---------00:51----------
seriously there we go that's a 2850

---------00:54----------
board for you now every time you tap the

---------00:56----------
LVDS much chip it's gonna do something

---------00:58----------
like this oh yeah see and this is one of

---------01:03----------
those can you replace my screen cable

---------01:04----------
can you please replace my screen cable I

---------01:07----------
fix it for I'm set its the screen cable

---------01:09----------
and let me tell you if you read it on I

---------01:11----------
fix it answers it's probably not

---------01:13----------
true so let's go over what the LVDS MUX

---------01:15----------
is its importance and why you should not

---------01:18----------
listen to the internet if you there this

---------01:20----------
is great poster that Bo Dorsey had in

---------01:22----------
his facebook wall a long time ago it

---------01:24----------
said something like you know the

---------01:25----------
internet told you what's wrong with your

---------01:27----------
 that's great good luck in the

---------01:28----------
Internet to fix I love that poster

---------01:30----------
alright so let's go over yeah okay so

---------01:38----------
where is this seriously it doesn't show

---------01:43----------
up in the beginning I think the actual

---------01:46----------
Apple II is the wrong number for in the

---------01:47----------
beginning why that it's not viewable in

---------01:49----------
this command alright here we go so see

---------01:51----------
this this is the LVDS connector so this

---------01:54----------
guy asked me to replace the cable that

---------01:56----------
plugs into the connector now the LVDS

---------01:58----------
connector over here has two separate

---------02:00----------
inputs it can have an input from the PCH

---------02:04----------
which is how see the CPU talks of the

---------02:07----------
PCH PCH then we'll send the CPUs

---------02:10----------
integrated graphics from the HD 3000 in

---------02:13----------
here

---------02:13----------
over to the graphics MUX or the graphics

---------02:17----------
chip which here they spelled as

---------02:18----------
traffic's yeah

---------02:21----------
traffic's yeah fixed insert joke that

---------02:29----------
would get me in trouble on camera here

---------02:31----------
and so we go to the prefix card and that

---------02:34----------
also goes to the graphics MUX so if

---------02:36----------
there's anything wrong with this chip

---------02:37----------
over here in between the LVDS connector

---------02:41----------
and the in the CPU or the graphics chip

---------02:44----------
you'll get what you see on screen and

---------02:47----------
that chip is something you could see in

---------02:49----------
the microscope here using the crappier

---------02:50----------
capture hardware because my I can't

---------02:52----------
reboot my damn computer ok so first

---------02:56----------
thing we have to do is heat this up and

---------02:57----------
most of the time it's in it this is one

---------02:59----------
of those chips that's not flipped chips

---------03:00----------
so very often it is actually the balls I

---------03:02----------
know I shouldn't say that on camera

---------03:04----------
because people are gonna start reflow in

---------03:05----------
graphics chips if I say that on camera

---------03:07----------
so we just to heat this up enough that I

---------03:09----------
can get rid of that silicon let's

---------03:13----------
get this on screen

---------03:22----------
this is an underfill it's edge bonding

---------03:24----------
underfill is when it goes all the way

---------03:25----------
under the chip that I'm not with

---------03:27----------
let's just deal with that this is now if

---------03:31----------
you if you give me like a thousand bucks

---------03:33----------
I'll replace the chip with underfill but

---------03:35----------
this is edge bonding it's supposed to

---------03:37----------
keep the balls from breaking and you can

---------03:39----------
see what a great job it does of that

---------03:44----------
yeah so I have the the hot air station

---------03:48----------
set the 230 Celsius from far away

---------03:50----------
usually it comes off in one piece unless

---------03:52----------
I'm doing a YouTube video so you know of

---------03:56----------
course it's not gonna come off in one

---------03:57----------
piece from doing a YouTube video but

---------03:59----------
usually you

---------04:00----------
usually you can't get this off in one

---------04:02----------
piece okay weird that's good to go oh

---------04:09----------
this sucks

---------04:10----------
none of it actually wants to come off on

---------04:12----------
one piece go figure

---------04:21----------
yeah usually this really is easy to get

---------04:23----------
off in one piece I've done it in other

---------04:24----------
videos it's not going to happen here

---------04:48----------
yeah the whole idea behind getting rid

---------04:51----------
of the edge bonding is that that stuff

---------04:52----------
is gonna melt its solder melting

---------04:54----------
temperatures and combined with the balls

---------04:55----------
and result in nothing working at all

---------04:57----------
which is precisely why I can't tell

---------04:59----------
Steve that I'm doing this because this

---------05:01----------
person only approved a cable replacement

---------05:04----------
but since he's not a dick if this works

---------05:06----------
I'll just charge him for cable play

---------05:07----------
replacement at 150 and not motherboard

---------05:10----------
repair at 325 and I'll get used to that

---------05:12----------
that's not doesn't me I'm gonna do it

---------05:13----------
for everybody I'm just doing that

---------05:15----------
because at this point in time I'd

---------05:17----------
honestly rather reflow this then replace

---------05:19----------
the cable and I also know it's

---------05:21----------
not the cable it's never the cable it's

---------05:25----------
only the LCD cable because it's only the

---------05:27----------
LCD cable because people on I fix it

---------05:30----------
I've been saying for the last 10 years

---------05:32----------
have you checked the LCD cable the LCD

---------05:35----------
cable has never been so you have to

---------05:38----------
clean this crap from the sides

---------05:46----------
greatly silly that stuff always comes

---------05:48----------
off on its own no I look at it from this

---------05:53----------
no that will never come off with

---------05:56----------
isopropyl usually I just shove the board

---------05:58----------
in the oven and then I take it off with

---------06:00----------
with this but this really didn't want to

---------06:02----------
come off I think so if I had to guess I

---------06:07----------
would say yeah all right so look so

---------06:17----------
you're only going to be on YouTube if

---------06:18----------
this works because if this doesn't work

---------06:19----------
and his board goes on fire

---------06:21----------
I might elect to not put this on the

---------06:23----------
Internet so all right usually the things

---------06:29----------
that go on fire go into it they go on a

---------06:31----------
separate channel that is private or

---------06:34----------
unlisted

---------06:39----------
yeah the Rossman bad day group channel

---------06:42----------
okay get this out it is

---------06:52----------
not $1,800 gorgeous but gorgeous yeah

---------06:59----------
this this was a really job I'd to

---------07:01----------
taking that off anyway enough is enough

---------07:04----------
it's gonna work it's gonna work if it's

---------07:06----------
not it's not yeah this is not a flip

---------07:12----------
chip design if like a graphics chip like

---------07:14----------
the old AMD CPUs or something there most

---------07:17----------
of the time if you fix it with heat the

---------07:19----------
issue is inside the chip there are

---------07:20----------
little bumps inside the chip but here

---------07:23----------
this is a single layer chip so it's

---------07:25----------
totally safe to reball amount reball to

---------07:27----------
reflow okay it's just a really annoying

---------07:30----------
chip to reflow okay heat

---------07:44----------
they can I never figured out how to use

---------07:46----------
that the thing has graphs at a saving of

---------07:48----------
graphs it has all sorts of stuff that

---------07:49----------
I've never looked into that I really

---------07:52----------
should the main feature that I like of

---------07:56----------
it is not taking ten minutes to eat up

---------08:01----------
that's just the flux

---------08:03----------
I'm not heating it to melt solder yet

---------08:06----------
I'm just heating it to yeah well I try

---------08:18----------
to preheat the area first so that's why

---------08:19----------
I'm holding the iron further away it's

---------08:22----------
about like an inch and a half two inches

---------08:23----------
from the chip right now what I do is I

---------08:25----------
wait to see that see how there's flux

---------08:26----------
around the chip that's slowly

---------08:28----------
evaporating away and it's slowly moving

---------08:30----------
away and once there's only flux around

---------08:32----------
the direct exterior of the chip I'll

---------08:35----------
know that it's time for me to go in

---------08:37----------
closer on it what's it like see if the

---------08:42----------
board is cold then to get I need to get

---------08:45----------
the balls to like 220 Celsius around

---------08:47----------
there so if the iron is at 350 or 450

---------08:51----------
and the board is at let's say 27 the

---------08:55----------
board is gonna be pulling down the

---------08:56----------
temperature well if T's a higher

---------08:58----------
temperature on the iron but if the board

---------08:59----------
is hot then I can use a lower

---------09:01----------
temperature on the iron on the iron on

---------09:03----------
the hot air and it'll work yeah I have a

---------09:11----------
board that was sent in that was that

---------09:12----------
somebody is the weather he the wild pcs

---------09:16----------
special did you ever go to wild pcs

---------09:18----------
thank God yeah what I said

---------09:21----------
yeah they're scamming pricks I wouldn't

---------09:26----------
give them a remote control to fix okay

---------09:29----------
so the flux is only directly around the

---------09:31----------
chip now not far out so I can go in on

---------09:35----------
it and I'll give it about ten seconds

---------09:39----------
now if I had removed all the edge

---------09:42----------
bonding properly it would be moving

---------09:43----------
around but I didn't because I'm a

---------09:44----------
 so

---------09:48----------
that's mostly flux because the air

---------09:50----------
filters on medium instead of high

---------10:01----------
alright it is still on the board and the

---------10:06----------
board doesn't look roasted and the

---------10:09----------
capture card is flickering okay yeah the

---------10:19----------
anti-static paper towels go up here

---------10:29----------
this is Mike yeah half of the stuff that

---------10:34----------
people bring up I don't remember until

---------10:36----------
they say it and I have a lot of

---------10:40----------
anti-static controlling yeah I mean yeah

---------10:50----------
it's also about how your hands are like

---------10:51----------
do you touch the side of the board at

---------10:52----------
the top of the board do you

---------10:54----------
you know re if you're walking on a

---------10:56----------
carpet are you going to touch the jb

---------10:58----------
cease the side of it do am I gonna touch

---------11:00----------
the amp or this so this power supply

---------11:02----------
right next to me is always plugged in

---------11:03----------
usually turned on so if I touch this I

---------11:04----------
ground myself so I'm constantly

---------11:06----------
grounding myself with what's around me

---------11:07----------
okay now let's see if this well firstly

---------11:10----------
the first thing to do is see if we are

---------11:12----------
worse off than we were before

---------11:13----------
so there's actually a cellar there's

---------11:15----------
actually a celebration and literally

---------11:17----------
being where you were before you started

---------11:19----------
 with stuff so I am right back

---------11:22----------
where I started the day that's the first

---------11:24----------
thing I celebrate after that we

---------11:26----------
celebrate if it actually works alright

---------11:28----------
so if I hit the power button yeah okay

---------11:39----------
Wow hmm batter am I using a 65 water an

---------11:46----------
80 watt

---------11:56----------
okay

---------11:57----------
shitty charger dong give me a nice long

---------12:06----------
dong as sunny would say or a light hello

---------12:23----------
let's turn you on and reset spirit high

---------12:28----------
power button okay this is dirty most the

---------12:35----------
things that touch your disgusting you

---------12:41----------
better work whoa

---------12:44----------
okay how about the image on the screen a

---------12:49----------
lot actually no I'm not gonna get an

---------12:57----------
image at all yeah okay so what's the

---------13:01----------
chip that chip was dead well it was semi

---------13:04----------
dead no a semi dead now it's a hundred

---------13:06----------
percent did

---------13:07----------
welcome to the videos that never go on

---------13:10----------
YouTube I have to reball that later what

---------13:14----------
a nightmare let's see if I push on you

---------13:16----------
what do I get

---------13:16----------
oh you won't get anything you won't even

---------13:24----------
get screen recognition let's see didn't

---------13:29----------
knock anything off and these are the

---------13:39----------
videos that don't make their way to the

---------13:41----------
internet they're actually somewhere I've

---------13:44----------
set stuff on fire that I have to edit

---------13:47----------
alright so what I did is I actually

---------13:49----------
turned off the camera just to show that

---------13:51----------
the fact that the camera does break half

---------13:52----------
of my repairs we went to go we went

---------13:55----------
another go over the chip Andry flowing

---------13:56----------
it and I noticed that what didn't drive

---------13:59----------
properly the first time you've got to be

---------14:02----------
 kidding me watch I'm gonna smash

---------14:03----------
the board cuz remember before what it

---------14:05----------
was doing works this is

---------14:12----------
I decided not to record it because I

---------14:14----------
figured I wasn't gonna work but yes look

---------14:21----------
I'm gonna say same computer and

---------14:23----------
trust me if I replace the chip the area

---------14:25----------
would not look like lo look at this look

---------14:27----------
you can see that these little pieces of

---------14:28----------
edge bonding I haven't removed that's

---------14:30----------
the same piece of hair that was there

---------14:31----------
originally that is burned off edge

---------14:35----------
bonding from first

---------14:37----------
go on our very professional repair and

---------14:40----------
on one hand I can't really warranty this

---------14:43----------
because it was a up ass repair on

---------14:45----------
the other hand I'm giving it to somebody

---------14:46----------
who couldn't afford to pay for the

---------14:48----------
repair anyway who came in with some

---------14:49----------
broken so they'll leave with

---------14:51----------
something that's not broken which is

---------14:53----------
really yeah kind of evens everything out

---------14:55----------
my charity for the for the year yeah

---------15:01----------
okay
