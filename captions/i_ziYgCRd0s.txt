---------00:00----------
hi so today we're going to start off

---------00:03----------
with an 8 to 0 2879 board that only

---------00:08----------
charges the battery when it is off or

---------00:10----------
asleep which is annoying now this board

---------00:13----------
honestly was an embarrassment for me for

---------00:16----------
the amount of time that it took to

---------00:17----------
figure this out firstly while I've

---------00:20----------
solved many note charging or not turning

---------00:23----------
on issues I've never ever ever ever had

---------00:27----------
only charges when it's asleep or off and

---------00:29----------
does not charge when it's on that is

---------00:31----------
that that is that is just absurd to me

---------00:33----------
confusing and secondly it wasn't obvious

---------00:36----------
liquid or physical damage so let me show

---------00:38----------
you what I mean by obvious liquid a

---------00:40----------
physical damage this one does not have

---------00:41----------
any obvious liquid damage so I'm going

---------00:44----------
to show you one replacing just to give

---------00:45----------
you an idea here was this resistor here

---------00:50----------
okay and this resistor above it which is

---------00:52----------
actually really up looking and I

---------00:54----------
should replace that if to actually prove

---------00:56----------
the job but anyway it works and as you

---------00:59----------
can see the probe points around this

---------01:01----------
look totally fine there's nothing funny

---------01:03----------
about now let me see if I can show you

---------01:05----------
on a dead board what I mean by probe

---------01:07----------
points looking up the board

---------01:09----------
actually has a way of telling you what

---------01:12----------
where to start looking when something

---------01:16----------
doesn't work so before I use my brain I

---------01:18----------
can get a hint we find a board here that

---------01:21----------
I can use as an example these are all

---------01:25----------
dead and like I've used these two

---------01:28----------
second

---------01:29----------
set up profiles on the BGA machine so

---------01:32----------
they don't even have most I don't even

---------01:33----------
have CPUs or gpus the totally so if

---------01:36----------
I drop them I don't

---------01:37----------
okay so you see how some of these Pro

---------01:40----------
points right by this connector or red

---------01:42----------
really brown like can I reach my hand

---------01:46----------
here like that they're and you

---------01:51----------
can see that they're or like this

---------01:52----------
little red probe points here

---------02:00----------
oh come on focus you

---------02:06----------
there we go okay now that's not a water

---------02:08----------
damage indicator those are actual probes

---------02:10----------
on the motherboard so that instead of

---------02:12----------
having to measure at a component lead

---------02:14----------
when these component leads are really

---------02:15----------
small it allows you to just measure at

---------02:18----------
those points it makes life a lot easier

---------02:21----------
when you're measuring around anyway a

---------02:23----------
lot of the times those points will be

---------02:24----------
bright red or really or F

---------02:26----------
corrosion on them or even be missing and

---------02:28----------
that will give me an idea hey start here

---------02:31----------
here's a hint so when the board is not

---------02:33----------
physically or liquid damaged and you

---------02:34----------
have no probe points like that that are

---------02:37----------
off and the board itself has an issue

---------02:39----------
that I've never experienced before

---------02:41----------
I wind up looking like the jacket is

---------02:44----------
trying to figure it out and that's what

---------02:45----------
I was here so the board charges the

---------02:48----------
battery just fine when it's asleep or

---------02:51----------
off but when you take it out of sleep it

---------02:53----------
doesn't it doesn't do it and I looked

---------02:55----------
around this for quite a bit and I simply

---------02:58----------
couldn't figure it out because at first

---------02:59----------
I didn't even notice the pattern I just

---------03:01----------
thought that it wasn't charging I didn't

---------03:03----------
notice that when I I closed it that it

---------03:05----------
would start charging because most of the

---------03:06----------
times I would close the computer to

---------03:08----------
start working on and remove the board

---------03:09----------
the first thing that I was doing was

---------03:11----------
ripping out the charger because I'm not

---------03:13----------
going to take all the screws out of this

---------03:14----------
of all the things on so it took me at

---------03:16----------
least a day to figure the

---------03:18----------
pattern out that it's not charging the

---------03:20----------
battery unless it's in sleep mode which

---------03:23----------
I just feel [ __ ] for but I guess you

---------03:26----------
know didn't learn so onto the on so what

---------03:31----------
actually fixed it so there are these two

---------03:33----------
resistors over here and their job is to

---------03:36----------
sense the current that's coming through

---------03:38----------
from the adapter and there's also a

---------03:40----------
similar circuit for the battery that's

---------03:41----------
meant to measure the voltage coming from

---------03:43----------
the battery now this is something that I

---------03:45----------
didn't know was here before and

---------03:48----------
again I'm totally open to people going

---------03:53----------
I've always been open to saying what it

---------03:56----------
is I don't know because as one of my

---------03:59----------
great mentors and first employer said

---------04:01----------
everything that I've learned in life

---------04:03----------
worthwhile was from not being afraid to

---------04:05----------
show just how stupid I am

---------04:06----------
if you don't tell people that you don't

---------04:08----------
know something they'll never have an

---------04:09----------
opportunity to tell you what it is and

---------04:10----------
don't know anyway so there are two

---------04:14----------
resistors here that's in their job is to

---------04:16----------
sense the current coming from the

---------04:17----------
adapter now with those two resistors do

---------04:21----------
there's one on each side of a resistor

---------04:24----------
from the from the charger so you have

---------04:26----------
the charger the charger itself is going

---------04:28----------
through a bunch of transistors to tell

---------04:29----------
that tell it whether or not it should

---------04:30----------
come on send voltage or not send voltage

---------04:32----------
and at the end of that there's a

---------04:33----------
resistive at 0.02 ohm something like

---------04:36----------
zero points or look at it schematic here

---------04:40----------
can you see how bright this table is

---------04:42----------
I've always dreamed having a work

---------04:44----------
environment this right so by the way

---------04:46----------
that's since I didn't get enough shelves

---------04:48----------
at IKEA I have a wire coming from the

---------04:52----------
PCI Express with my data recovery

---------04:54----------
machine that is going over this monitor

---------04:57----------
which is being used as a pulley to keep

---------04:59----------
the lights up on this side of the table

---------05:00----------
until IKEA gets the shelves in

---------05:03----------
stock that I need and then it goes over

---------05:05----------
here that's five LED strips that is just

---------05:09----------
ridiculously bright and three of them

---------05:11----------
are actually different brands and

---------05:13----------
different color tones so you get almost

---------05:15----------
a full spectrum of lighting so let's

---------05:18----------
back to

---------05:20----------
like to work in okay where are we here

---------05:28----------
okay so yeah the charger is coming

---------05:30----------
through here here here so right here are

---------05:34----------
71 so this is a 0.02 ohm resistor

---------05:37----------
there's going to be a voltage drop

---------05:38----------
across this but it's going to be so

---------05:40----------
 small and inconsequential that

---------05:42----------
it's not gonna actually affect the

---------05:43----------
functionality of the computer because

---------05:45----------
again it's 0.02 ohms so you have this

---------05:50----------
here whoops

---------05:52----------
pointing to where I'm supposed to be let

---------05:54----------
me zoom out okay see them so this is the

---------05:57----------
resistor this is the charger now over

---------05:59----------
here you have a resistor that's going to

---------06:03----------
the ISL and on the other side of this

---------06:05----------
you got a resistant that's going to the

---------06:06----------
ISO point of this is to measure the

---------06:08----------
current that's being used so debate now

---------06:11----------
the thing is the currents that is being

---------06:13----------
used is going to affect the voltage drop

---------06:16----------
here the voltage drop is going to be

---------06:17----------
affected by the current that is actually

---------06:20----------
being pulled by the computer so by

---------06:21----------
measuring the voltage drop which is

---------06:23----------
something this can do this chip cannot

---------06:25----------
measure current but it will measure a

---------06:26----------
voltage drop across two different points

---------06:28----------
if you give it those two different

---------06:30----------
points you can actually deduce what

---------06:32----------
amount of currents the computer is using

---------06:34----------
now this is supposed to be 10 ohms and

---------06:36----------
this is supposed to be 10 ohms so that

---------06:37----------
on each side of this you get an even

---------06:39----------
measurement now one of these is 500 kilo

---------06:41----------
ohms and the other one was 2.8 million

---------06:44----------
ohms so this was getting a completely

---------06:48----------
 up reading not only was the power

---------06:50----------
going to this chip so low that it

---------06:51----------
probably couldn't even detect or

---------06:53----------
read anything at all but this was so out

---------06:57----------
of whack that it would have thought

---------06:59----------
either that there is a huge and rush of

---------07:01----------
current so that there's no current being

---------07:03----------
used there's some sort of stupid silly

---------07:04----------
 because these were off by a

---------07:06----------
magnitude of about 5 times res here

---------07:09----------
they're equal now what I don't

---------07:11----------
understand and what you're not I'd love

---------07:14----------
for somebody to tell me is if it noticed

---------07:16----------
that there was a ridiculous amount of

---------07:18----------
volt of current being used why doesn't

---------07:21----------
it just turn the Machine off altogether

---------07:22----------
because again the only thing that I can

---------07:24----------
deduce here is that when the machine is

---------07:26----------
on it's using more power and since the

---------07:28----------
circuit that detects how much power the

---------07:30----------
charge how much power is coming from the

---------07:31----------
charger is that when they can

---------07:34----------
pewter is on it probably thought oh my

---------07:36----------
god it's using way too much power let me

---------07:37----------
turn off charging to the battery why

---------07:40----------
wouldn't just why wouldn't it in

---------07:41----------
addition to that also turn off power to

---------07:43----------
the machine itself because it thinks

---------07:45----------
it's grabbing too much

---------07:46----------
am I wrong am i right and then is there

---------07:49----------
something I'm missing again I would

---------07:51----------
absolutely love to be educated because I

---------07:53----------
enjoy learning anyway so we'll replace

---------07:56----------
these two as you can see it's charging

---------07:59----------
and when I turn the computer on I got

---------08:06----------
the fan spinning and just see you can

---------08:12----------
see the reflections of all those LEDs

---------08:13----------
which is total overkill but I love it

---------08:15----------
and we got the Apple on it is still

---------08:18----------
charging and I'm up to 73% and before I

---------08:22----------
started making this video I was at

---------08:23----------
something like 14 so I'm winning but

---------08:26----------
yeah my question is if it thought that

---------08:29----------
there was so much current coming through

---------08:30----------
when it was on that it's wanted to stop

---------08:32----------
charging the battery why not just stop

---------08:34----------
turning the computer on isn't turning

---------08:36----------
the computer on if it is if this adapter

---------08:39----------
is getting skull-fuck so bad that it

---------08:40----------
doesn't have the ability to charge the

---------08:42----------
battery if the computer thinks that's

---------08:43----------
true

---------08:44----------
wouldn't that adapt to be going on fire

---------08:45----------
just from powering the computer on again

---------08:48----------
maybe I'm missing something and and I'd

---------08:50----------
land again I would absolutely love to

---------08:52----------
learn so by all means if you know more

---------08:54----------
than me I would love to hear from you

---------08:56----------
either way it does work and that's you

---------09:00----------
know as much as I'd like to know more

---------09:02----------
I'm happy that I solve the problem

---------09:04----------
because that means that I can

---------09:06----------
get the money now another thing I wanted

---------09:09----------
to make a little point I want to make

---------09:10----------
you as I get a lot of live chat requests

---------09:13----------
or phone calls from people saying my

---------09:14----------
battery doesn't charge what chip

---------09:16----------
controls the charging I can tell you

---------09:19----------
what chip controls the charging you zoom

---------09:21----------
in on it right here but frankly having

---------09:24----------
that information is not going to help

---------09:26----------
you here we go so it's that but what's

---------09:29----------
the point of knowing what trip controls

---------09:30----------
the charging if there are many different

---------09:32----------
reasons that it it could not be working

---------09:35----------
now if somebody for example if somebody

---------09:37----------
comes in says their screen is cracked

---------09:39----------
you know okay I have to replace the

---------09:41----------
screen but if somebody comes in and says

---------09:42----------
my computer is slow well it could be

---------09:45----------
slow because their home internet sucks

---------09:46----------
it could be slow because they have a

---------09:48----------
virus it could be slow because their

---------09:49----------
drive is dying it could be slow because

---------09:51----------
their fan died and you know the machines

---------09:55----------
is running really hot and throttling

---------09:57----------
itself there are many different reasons

---------09:58----------
so I can't really help you without

---------10:01----------
having an idea of what's going on and

---------10:03----------
sometimes I'll say you know there could

---------10:05----------
be many different things can you measure

---------10:06----------
this that or the other and people just

---------10:08----------
think I'm being rude or a dick or you

---------10:10----------
know I'm trying to hold this information

---------10:11----------
hostage from them and some people have

---------10:14----------
ego you know gone so far as to say

---------10:16----------
you on live chat over this ridiculous

---------10:18----------
 when I'll state this and honestly

---------10:22----------
if you have to use your brain I mean

---------10:25----------
again I don't even understand some of

---------10:27----------
what it is I did but I did have to use

---------10:30----------
my brain in order to deduce it so if I

---------10:33----------
you don't even know what I'm doing some

---------10:34----------
of the time and I've been doing this for

---------10:35----------
many years don't think that you're just

---------10:38----------
going to replace one thing and that's

---------10:40----------
going to fix all of your problems

---------10:41----------
another example people will also often

---------10:44----------
asked about this chip over here because

---------10:46----------
it'll get corroded the 71 49 and on the

---------10:50----------
older 2530 and 23 27 boards that is a

---------10:53----------
hat 11 27 now this is a transistor and

---------10:57----------
it has three legs that are redundant and

---------10:59----------
oftentimes with liquid damage one of

---------11:00----------
those legs will be completely corroded

---------11:02----------
to and people will ask me what is

---------11:03----------
the name of that so I can replace it you

---------11:06----------
can go ahead and replace it but that

---------11:07----------
chip is used to taking 18 19 volts and

---------11:09----------
it is a

---------11:10----------
so you know it's a transistor with a

---------11:12----------
huge heat it's it's not going to die if

---------11:14----------
you're bored if this thing actually

---------11:18----------
managed to blow if you managed to blow

---------11:21----------
this up you would not have a

---------11:23----------
motherboard anymore this would be

---------11:24----------
 vaporized beyond any repair

---------11:27----------
I have not replaced this thing once in

---------11:29----------
many many years

---------11:30----------
it's an but people will just see this

---------11:32----------
one thing is burned how do I replace it

---------11:33----------
I want a new charger I see and again

---------11:35----------
unfortunately it is not that easy there

---------11:38----------
is really no shortcut around using your

---------11:40----------
brain don't replace the backlight I see

---------11:43----------
because you have no backlight don't

---------11:44----------
replace the charger I see because it's

---------11:45----------
not charging and if you go ahead and do

---------11:48----------
it I encourage you to go ahead and do it

---------11:49----------
because I don't want you to take my word

---------11:51----------
for you're not going to believe me I

---------11:52----------
want you to actually do it to figure out

---------11:54----------
that it doesn't work for yourself and

---------11:56----------
that there is no shortcut to using your

---------11:58----------
brain
