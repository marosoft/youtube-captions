---------00:00----------
all right and here we have another

---------00:02----------
MacBook we're going to open the bottom

---------00:04----------
of this MacBook and see what it looks

---------00:06----------
like on the inside and look oh boy this

---------00:10----------
MacBook gives me lots of hope and

---------00:12----------
happiness there's a screw just sitting

---------00:15----------
over here great job that screw belongs

---------00:17----------
in the fan over here and it's just

---------00:20----------
chilling no Jesus okay first thing to do

---------00:30----------
is put that screw back where it belongs

---------00:32----------
inside its fan oh okay screen doesn't

---------00:39----------
turn on all right let's take a look at

---------00:40----------
what's going on there first thing for he

---------00:42----------
do is check to see what the resistance

---------00:45----------
to ground is 24 ohms

---------00:47----------
that's no good so now we unplug the

---------00:50----------
screen and the resistance the ground

---------00:54----------
it's actually still rather low that's no

---------00:57----------
good

---------00:59----------
all right this is definitely an issue

---------01:00----------
with the screen but there's also an

---------01:02----------
issue regardless of the screen so we're

---------01:04----------
gonna take this board out of the case

---------01:06----------
because we that resistance the ground on

---------01:08----------
backlight is way too low we yeah still

---------01:12----------
274 ohms so let's look at everything

---------01:14----------
that's involved in the backlight circuit

---------01:16----------
now I'm going to start with the LCD

---------01:17----------
connector the reason I'm gonna start

---------01:19----------
with the LCD connector is because when I

---------01:20----------
unplug the screen there is a change in

---------01:23----------
the in there resistance it goes to down

---------01:25----------
to 27 ohms so the LCD cable is probably

---------01:27----------
burned and what I'm guessing is that

---------01:29----------
when the LCD cable burned it may have

---------01:31----------
burned something inside the LCD

---------01:32----------
connector as well and that's what could

---------01:35----------
be causing my issues so let's take a

---------01:37----------
look over here it doesn't look too

---------01:42----------
terrible but still I'm probably just

---------01:43----------
gonna remove that all right so let's get

---------01:46----------
my hot air here

---------01:58----------
I'm I'm sick - Douglas no fun okay

---------02:24----------
all right so we've removed the LCD

---------02:27----------
connector

---------02:41----------
so it seems that we have 165 kilohms to

---------02:44----------
ground here which means that there was

---------02:46----------
some sort of short inside the LCD

---------02:48----------
connector so yeah we went from 300 ohms

---------02:52----------
to 166 thousand ohms so we have made

---------02:56----------
some progress now we have to get ready

---------02:58----------
to solder a new LCD connector there as

---------03:00----------
well

---------03:36----------
okay I could use a little bit of

---------03:37----------
cleaning now with a q-tip and some

---------03:39----------
alcohol let's go for it

---------04:09----------
cleaning stuff is so satisfying

---------04:11----------
instantly cleaning and evaporates in a

---------04:13----------
cooled way yep I love a 99% alcohol for

---------04:17----------
that

---------04:29----------
all right so you've got our nice happy

---------04:32----------
new connector

---------04:35----------
[Music]

---------05:05----------
make sure this thing is pushed down

---------05:07----------
nicely Sam didn't have enough solder on

---------05:14----------
my tip need a bigger glob and my tip

---------05:19----------
this time it's not gonna work properly

---------05:24----------
if you have a tiny glob on your tip

---------05:53----------
you

---------06:01----------
you

---------06:53----------
I used way too big a glob here that was

---------07:00----------
dumb

---------07:07----------
how many years will it take Louis to

---------07:08----------
learn how to properly solder a damn LCD

---------07:11----------
connector

---------07:24----------
mid von league hustling all right now

---------07:30----------
let's see if this thing works met van

---------07:33----------
League hustling I'm learning new

---------07:35----------
languages see if we get a light on the

---------07:37----------
screen all right let's see if we get a

---------07:39----------
light

---------07:51----------
forty six point five volts that is a

---------07:55----------
light bizarre so this definitely needs a

---------07:59----------
new LCD cable and also an ultrasonic

---------08:01----------
cleaning but that is that this macbook

---------08:07----------
appears to be fixed
