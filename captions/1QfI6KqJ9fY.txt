---------00:00----------
all right here we have a missing p.m.

---------00:01----------
sleep s4l bored given to me by Camille

---------00:03----------
and we're gonna try and figure out why

---------00:05----------
this board has a missing p.m. sleep best

---------00:07----------
for I'll confirm that it's a PM sleep

---------00:08----------
best for all problem and then throw it

---------00:10----------
at Steve who decided put it in my cute

---------00:12----------
by the way by the end of the week you're

---------00:13----------
gonna see hi hi again thing is you may

---------00:15----------
think that he may not show up this time

---------00:17----------
because he didn't show up the last two

---------00:18----------
or three times but that's not true

---------00:20----------
because last night I did a little bit of

---------00:22----------
research and I found out where he lives

---------00:24----------
that's right hi hi you don't come to

---------00:27----------
work work is gonna come to you it's the

---------00:31----------
first thing we're gonna do I'm just

---------00:32----------
gonna troubleshoot this from scratch and

---------00:34----------
just pretend that I don't know that it's

---------00:35----------
a PM sleep s4l now we have a light in

---------00:37----------
the charger so pp3 before 2 has to be

---------00:39----------
there so you have 12.6 SMC is doing its

---------00:41----------
job and we're gonna check the pit the

---------00:43----------
5vs5 I'm in the pit of 5 es 4 area over

---------00:45----------
here we have a very heavily pro at the 5

---------00:48----------
es 5 area 5 as present VP 3 V 3 s 5 is

---------00:57----------
present clock chip that's present ok now

---------01:03----------
what's this okay what's this what is

---------01:09----------
this effort over here alright so the

---------01:11----------
first thing I want to do is figure out

---------01:12----------
what this FS is up going on up here

---------01:16----------
making an effort to curse a little bit

---------01:18----------
less it's probably not gonna go all

---------01:22----------
right so it looks like P P 1 V 3 5 cam

---------01:25----------
why are there rip traces around here and

---------01:27----------
furthermore why would we care and this

---------01:31----------
is for a camera I don't care about a

---------01:33----------
camera doesn't turn on we can't care

---------01:36----------
about a camera yep I kind of want to see

---------01:39----------
what's going on under that and I may

---------01:40----------
actually remove this man ship if that

---------01:42----------
man didn't leave this is a buffer I

---------01:44----------
think there's a 512 megabyte buffer chip

---------01:47----------
for memory does it also keep in mind if

---------01:51----------
there's a hole in this section of the

---------01:52----------
board what is this tell me this tells me

---------01:55----------
that damage occurred here it also tells

---------01:57----------
me that this board was likely cleaned

---------01:59----------
before it got to me if that tells me

---------02:01----------
that the thing next to it probably got

---------02:02----------
damaged the thing right next to it is a

---------02:03----------
clock ship that creates a 32 kilohertz

---------02:05----------
clock that is going to talk to the CPU

---------02:07----------
in the PCH and get the CPU and the PCH

---------02:09----------
running the CPU in the PCH is what's

---------02:10----------
gonna create p.m. sleep as 4 L which is

---------02:12----------
missing

---------02:12----------
Glock chip so let's see if we can

---------02:16----------
replace this with one that works because

---------02:18----------
that clock chip doesn't need happen to

---------02:19----------
be messed up see I am putting an effort

---------02:25----------
to curse less so if we go back over here

---------02:28----------
the camera chip is where we have all

---------02:29----------
this nastiness now I'm going to assume

---------02:31----------
if nastiness struck here that stuff next

---------02:32----------
to it as a cousin been damaged I don't

---------02:35----------
think that a camera buffer chip like

---------02:37----------
what we see over here is going to have

---------02:39----------
any sort of serious that this is not

---------02:41----------
gonna cause any sort of serious problem

---------02:43----------
I'm kind of curious if I could sector

---------02:45----------
map that you could use I don't think out

---------02:47----------
of the 400 people watching right now

---------02:50----------
that there's no more than one person in

---------02:51----------
my chat that knows what that means but

---------02:54----------
let's take a look and see what you 1900

---------02:58----------
was for you 1900 is what's going to

---------03:01----------
create a clock I really love it if you

---------03:04----------
left video goes up longer live videos up

---------03:07----------
longer I love watching the live shows

---------03:09----------
alright I'll leave it up for maybe a few

---------03:11----------
nights but we are we do live in a world

---------03:13----------
now where people will go through

---------03:15----------
everything that you've ever said over

---------03:18----------
the past 30 years find the one thing

---------03:20----------
that you've said that may be slightly

---------03:21----------
offensive to completely rip it out of

---------03:23----------
context and use it to destroy you as

---------03:24----------
human beings so I figured that leaving

---------03:26----------
up unedited livestreams or I'm

---------03:28----------
interacting with the audience and joking

---------03:30----------
back and forth might not be the best

---------03:32----------
idea until we move culture past that

---------03:34----------
culturally and as decide but anyway back

---------03:37----------
to you 1900s so it creates this is

---------03:39----------
responsible for a twenty five megahertz

---------03:41----------
 and at 32 kilohertz clock that 32

---------03:44----------
kilohertz clock as you can see goes to

---------03:46----------
the CPU the CPUs was proposed to be

---------03:48----------
creating my PM sleeve s4l which is

---------03:50----------
missing on the board so I am going to

---------03:53----------
take a guess that I should start here

---------03:55----------
and hopefully you kind of understand why

---------03:57----------
I've taken that bit leap

---------04:00----------
and how I came to this conclusion

---------04:10----------
by the way people everybody

---------04:13----------
congratulated high higher on his new job

---------04:14----------
high high in the chad has been a

---------04:16----------
moderator for two years and he is just

---------04:19----------
about hired assuming he shows up this

---------04:21----------
time

---------04:22----------
he also helped me fix my buffing bike

---------04:24----------
yesterday I think it's gonna be pretty

---------04:31----------
cool to have somebody who can finally

---------04:33----------
help me with stuff like video editing

---------04:35----------
and not just that but like all the

---------04:37----------
little things that I say I want to get

---------04:39----------
around to put that I don't do it's also

---------04:41----------
gonna be nice to be able to have a

---------04:42----------
little bit more free time new things

---------04:43----------
like sleep travel well mostly sleep it

---------04:51----------
would be nice to be able to sleep every

---------04:52----------
now and then

---------04:55----------
so there's a lot of things that this

---------04:57----------
business that could be better that I

---------04:59----------
haven't really put the time and that I

---------05:00----------
should have to make it better and I'd

---------05:03----------
like to start

---------05:05----------
again good staff here we got people like

---------05:07----------
Camille you've got people like Paul dear

---------05:12----------
maybe Kevin

---------05:16----------
nothing

---------05:18----------
but

---------05:23----------
nothing at all

---------06:04----------
hi I can come up with things like a live

---------06:07----------
stream bought that and automatically

---------06:08----------
answers questions that I've answered

---------06:09----------
millions of times before

---------06:11----------
I bet hi hi Kokoda Bach

---------06:15----------
I can't code but I bet hi hi can code ok

---------06:19----------
let's see what we get here all right

---------06:23----------
as you can see fan spin fan spin do you

---------06:33----------
understand what we're doing here you

---------06:34----------
understand we got it do you understand

---------06:36----------
why we did what we did so this board was

---------06:39----------
having an issue where it was missing

---------06:42----------
p.m. sleep s4l we took if we did a

---------06:44----------
physical inspection of the board and

---------06:45----------
there was a mess right around this area

---------06:49----------
now this area if this area is a mess I'm

---------06:51----------
going to assume that would ever happen

---------06:52----------
if whatever is liquid or any sort of

---------06:55----------
junk may have affected things that are

---------06:57----------
in the surrounding area that are

---------06:58----------
sensitive like let's say a chip whose

---------07:00----------
sole job it is to create a 32 kilohertz

---------07:02----------
and manage a 25 megahertz clock crystal

---------07:04----------
that's the type of thing or even the

---------07:06----------
teeny tiniest bit of water is going to

---------07:07----------
hurt it it's not like an ISL 6 2 5 9

---------07:09----------
we're gonna see a hole punched through

---------07:11----------
it it's the type of thing where even the

---------07:12----------
teeny tiniest bit of messing with it and

---------07:17----------
this is new for me no cursing little

---------07:20----------
tiny bit of water will mess it up now if

---------07:23----------
you look at the schematic and the board

---------07:25----------
view that's the only thing in the

---------07:27----------
surrounding area that's gonna have a

---------07:28----------
relation to the PC age you have the SMC

---------07:30----------
that's not really responsible for PM

---------07:32----------
sleep s4l stuff it is responsible for

---------07:34----------
deciding that you're ready to enter a

---------07:37----------
state of getting PM sleep s4l at all so

---------07:39----------
for example a PM DSW power good is

---------07:41----------
missing a bit of a flat PM sleep bus for

---------07:43----------
all but here we didn't have a flat PM

---------07:44----------
sleep best for all we had a pulsing PM

---------07:45----------
sleep best for l if you look under it

---------07:47----------
you have camera stuff that's not

---------07:49----------
important camera stuff here not

---------07:51----------
important BAM

---------07:52----------
this is important because that goes

---------07:54----------
straight to the PC Asian if we want to

---------07:56----------
really trace back where PM sleep best

---------07:58----------
for all comes from over here you see

---------07:59----------
that PM sleep Sol it's p5 ves for RS 3

---------08:03----------
enable if you go back to this resistor

---------08:06----------
you'll see that comes from p5 es for our

---------08:09----------
3 enable D and that comes from PM sleep

---------08:12----------
s4 well PM sleep best for ell comes from

---------08:15----------
the PCH and the system management

---------08:16----------
controller chip

---------08:17----------
see right up here so you need the ends

---------08:20----------
on the left and you get the outs on the

---------08:22----------
right ends and left

---------08:23----------
gives you the outs on the right and once

---------08:24----------
you're done with that you're gonna get

---------08:25----------
fan spin fan spin so that's it for that

---------08:29----------
board and as always I hope you learned

---------08:31----------
something all this board needed was one

---------08:33----------
little chip and it was picked at random

---------08:36----------
when random but that we're gonna move on

---------08:40----------

---------08:42----------
