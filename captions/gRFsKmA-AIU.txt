---------00:00----------
I see it Apple of the screen but I don't

---------00:02----------
see a backlight so nothing here looks

---------00:04----------
that bad the first thing that I want to

---------00:07----------
do is check out the backlight voltage

---------00:09----------
because different backlight voltages

---------00:10----------
will mean different things

---------00:11----------
backlight is legit zero volts alright so

---------00:14----------
there's a couple of things that we're

---------00:15----------
going to be searching for and checking

---------00:18----------
for here we have these data lines over

---------00:21----------
here that go between the screen and the

---------00:23----------
LED driver odd pits 15 and 16

---------00:26----------
respectively on pins 15 and 16 that is

---------00:29----------
going to go to pins 3 and 4 of the LCD

---------00:34----------
connector these are data lines and these

---------00:36----------
are pulled up by our 775 2 and our 7 7 5

---------00:41----------
3 they are pulled up to PP 5 ESO which

---------00:45----------
is 5 volts so I should be seeing about 5

---------00:47----------
volts on each of those data lines so

---------00:51----------
what I'm gonna double check and see what

---------00:53----------
I'm getting there on those two data

---------00:54----------
lines the fan is blowing air at me and

---------00:57----------
it's cold

---------00:58----------
maybe 4 point 6 volts there and 4 point

---------01:03----------
6 volts there some guys think that's

---------01:07----------
good if it is communicating with the

---------01:11----------
screen now what I'm interested in seeing

---------01:13----------
is what happens if I unplug the screen

---------01:16----------
so I just unplug the screen and those

---------01:19----------
should be pulled up all the way to 5

---------01:20----------
because there's nothing there that could

---------01:22----------
be pulling it down and I get five point

---------01:25----------
two and five point two alright so the

---------01:29----------
screen is indeed able to communicate

---------01:32----------
with the system is is you 7700 receiving

---------01:36----------
the power it needs to turn on

---------01:43----------
that's supposed to be on pins 5 and 18

---------01:45----------
so in pin 5

---------01:46----------
I should be getting 5 volts which I am

---------01:53----------
and then on pin 18 so chip is getting

---------02:02----------
the power it needs to turn on next up I

---------02:05----------
want to see if it's being told to turn

---------02:06----------
on so it's getting the power needs to

---------02:08----------
turn on but let's see what we get a

---------02:09----------
backlight enable we're gonna check over

---------02:12----------
here

---------02:13----------
backlight enable is 3 point 4 volts all

---------02:16----------
right so it's being told to turn off

---------02:18----------
next up we're going to check and see if

---------02:20----------
this transistor is opening Q 7700 is a

---------02:24----------
p-channel MOSFET meaning that it's only

---------02:25----------
got open to voltage in the gate pin 3 is

---------02:27----------
lower than the voltage at the source pin

---------02:29----------
4 so let's look for a Q 7700 and check

---------02:33----------
for the voltage up it's three dead pins

---------02:36----------
for AHA and three is twelve point five

---------02:39----------
the LED driver is not telling this to

---------02:42----------
open now there is a couple of reasons

---------02:44----------
that can be happening could be a bad LED

---------02:47----------
driver could be an issue with current

---------02:49----------
sensing so there is a current sensing

---------02:52----------
resistor here are 77 HUD REE and it's

---------02:57----------
going to sound as this system over here

---------02:59----------
with this LED driver is going a sense

---------03:03----------
how much current is going through the

---------03:05----------
system after the fuse and if it thinks

---------03:06----------
too much is going through because

---------03:08----------
there's too much of a difference in the

---------03:09----------
voltage from this side of the resistor

---------03:10----------
that side of the resistor it's gonna

---------03:11----------
turn off let's just make sure all those

---------03:13----------
pathways are good here and that's going

---------03:15----------
to be on pins 11 and 10 of the chip 11

---------03:22----------
in 10 so obviously if I'm going to

---------03:24----------
measure it resistance I got to turn the

---------03:25----------
power off let's see what are we out here

---------03:29----------
between pins 11 and 10 damn this is not

---------03:32----------
easy to measure the resistance here

---------03:38----------
Oh point five so current sensing circuit

---------03:43----------
is doing its job

---------03:44----------
nothing is corroded here at all yet this

---------03:50----------
is not opening

---------04:09----------
hmm what could be wrong here

---------04:28----------
nope here we are at three point four

---------04:30----------
volts in SMC lids so it's not a Hall

---------04:32----------
sensor

---------05:16----------
now imagine that this is something we

---------05:19----------
would have never seen if we didn't

---------05:21----------
remove the LED driver now let's see if

---------05:24----------
as somebody watching is paying attention

---------05:27----------
and can tell me what it is that's wrong

---------05:32----------
with this MacBooks backlight ugly pad

---------05:35----------
thing very good now what is that pad

---------05:37----------
going to be for one way to find out

---------05:40----------
we're gonna check the schematic in the

---------05:41----------
board view and this is this is a really

---------05:43----------
trolling board because we would have

---------05:44----------
never seen that there was no sign of

---------05:46----------
corrosion to let us know that that was

---------05:48----------
there now if we look this is for LCD

---------05:51----------
backlight feedback following the very

---------05:53----------
same failures that occur in many other

---------05:55----------
Mac books the feedback pad of the chip

---------05:58----------
is burned over here and if we look at

---------06:01----------
where at what LCD feedback is that is

---------06:04----------
going to be going to this voltage

---------06:05----------
divider over here which takes the

---------06:08----------
voltage from the output and sends it

---------06:11----------
back to the chip so that it could see

---------06:12----------
what it's creating this is a DC to DC

---------06:14----------
booster it's going to be switching

---------06:15----------
constantly in order to take a low

---------06:18----------
voltage like 12.5 and turn it into a

---------06:20----------
high voltage like 36 to 50 however if it

---------06:23----------
doesn't know what it's creating it's

---------06:25----------
going to want to stop out of safety

---------06:27----------
reasons so let's say you're driving in

---------06:29----------
your car and somebody throws a towel

---------06:30----------
over your face you're gonna smash on the

---------06:32----------
brakes because if you can't see where

---------06:33----------
you're going while you're speeding

---------06:36----------
yourself up you're gonna want to stop

---------06:37----------
and the same is true for this it's not

---------06:39----------
gonna produce a backlight if it can't

---------06:40----------
see what it's creating that's why we got

---------06:42----------
a pulse in the beginning instead of

---------06:43----------
nothing we got that quick pulse and then

---------06:46----------
it would decrease the voltage because it

---------06:48----------
couldn't see what it was creating and

---------06:49----------
that was because this pad over here is

---------06:52----------
burned because it's a MacBook now why

---------06:54----------
did this pad go burning why did this pad

---------06:57----------
burn why did this circuit die when there

---------06:59----------
are no signs of corrosion

---------07:01----------
no signs of liquid damage no signs of

---------07:03----------
physical damage no sign of anything that

---------07:06----------
had ever been abused in this MacBook

---------07:07----------
whatsoever why did that pageant

---------07:09----------
magically burn because it's a MacBook

---------07:12----------
it's a MacBook course it's going to

---------07:15----------
randomly break for no reason Mac - Mac -

---------07:18----------
Mac so let's fix this little MacBook and

---------07:22----------
make it all better again and do a little

---------07:24----------
bit of scrapy scraping

---------07:27----------
a little bit of scraping scraping and

---------07:30----------
we're gonna reveal the copper below the

---------07:32----------
corrosion look at that nice copper now

---------07:37----------
we're going to add some flux

---------07:47----------
it thought different it sure did it

---------07:53----------
dared to think different and then it

---------07:55----------
died

---------08:04----------
so something I've been thinking about

---------08:06----------
doing for the 1 million subscriber

---------08:07----------
special I'm not sure if this is a good

---------08:09----------
idea but I've been thinking of taking

---------08:11----------
the show on the road

---------08:13----------
what do you think of let's say we had a

---------08:16----------
huge projector and a table and a bunch

---------08:20----------
of broken MacBooks and we had a and some

---------08:25----------
sort of bleachers where we could have

---------08:26----------
like in a thousand person audience watch

---------08:29----------
the show and have something like that at

---------08:35----------
some venue in Manhattan for the thousand

---------08:37----------
I mean the 1 million subscriber special

---------08:44----------
so when I say what is the problem with

---------08:47----------
this board everybody could actually yell

---------08:49----------
out or we could have specific guesses

---------08:51----------
where different people have microphones

---------08:52----------
or something like that

---------08:55----------
I'm just gonna reinforce that pad with a

---------08:57----------
wire because we have about six months to

---------09:07----------
go until we are at a million and that's

---------09:10----------
gonna be quite a that's quite the number

---------09:12----------
I always thought that I would have about

---------09:15----------
two to three hundred subscribers at most

---------09:17----------
like the max I ever thought would be

---------09:20----------
that of the repair shops that will exist

---------09:22----------
like if all 300 repair shops that do

---------09:25----------
this stuff worldwide that do you know

---------09:28----------
component level stuff on macbook

---------09:29----------
swatched maybe I would get 300 that's if

---------09:32----------
I got every single one of them to watch

---------09:33----------
so that was my that was actually my high

---------09:36----------
estimate when I started doing this my

---------09:38----------
highest iment was maybe if I become

---------09:41----------
explosively popular I'll have 3,000

---------09:43----------
subscribers I mean 300 subscribers like

---------09:46----------
a Rossman convention perhaps.perhaps

---------09:52----------
Ross Khan yeah Ross Khan but people

---------09:58----------
named Ross van con you out of their

---------09:59----------
money

---------09:59----------
Ross huh

---------10:02----------
the Rossman foundation what if I named

---------10:06----------
it after my cat I'll name the meetup

---------10:10----------
after my cat we could call it the

---------10:12----------
Clinton Foundation great idea

---------10:14----------
Clinton calm

---------10:27----------
dammit keep losing the damn diet

---------10:39----------
I'm kind of curious who would actually

---------10:41----------
show up to this if anybody would at all

---------10:45----------
how many people watching this stream

---------10:48----------
would show up to a series of live shows

---------10:51----------
for a live show in person like where we

---------10:55----------
had a stage we'd have all the MacBooks

---------10:58----------
there we'd have a book we'd have a set

---------11:00----------
up we have all the donor boards and we'd

---------11:04----------
have maybe one or two thousand people in

---------11:06----------
an audience I'm kind of curious if this

---------11:09----------
is a good idea or a complete and utter

---------11:11----------
waste of time Paul Daniels would be the

---------11:13----------
guest of honor Paul Daniels would

---------11:15----------
definitely be a guest of honor I would

---------11:17----------
pay for Paul Daniels his hotel in flight

---------11:19----------
from Australia and for his food and all

---------11:22----------
of his stuff for being one of the people

---------11:26----------
to like really get involved in the

---------11:28----------
industry and put a lot of effort into

---------11:29----------
making things better with his software

---------11:31----------
so I'd love to I would be I would be

---------11:34----------
above thrilled to have Paul Daniels have

---------11:36----------
his own booth as a guest of honor

---------11:50----------
nasarah would be able to have her own

---------11:52----------
booth talking about how she was able to

---------11:54----------
put mobile fix out of business in just

---------11:57----------
six months

---------12:04----------
Paul would definitely be there

---------12:21----------
Paul Daniels would be showing off his

---------12:23----------
new software onstage hopefully it would

---------12:26----------
go better than Windows 98 and the BSOD

---------12:28----------
thing maybe it would maybe it wouldn't

---------12:40----------
and there goes my jumper oh well we'll

---------12:45----------
fix that in a moment I would definitely

---------12:48----------
try to fly out Duke as a guest of honor

---------12:51----------
Duke would definitely be a guest of

---------12:53----------
honor

---------12:54----------
[Applause]

---------13:01----------
Duke was an inspiration to me in this

---------13:03----------
field so I would absolutely have Duke

---------13:05----------
out as a guest of honor Paul will have a

---------13:10----------
booth that everybody can bring they're

---------13:11----------
missing their PM sleeve s4l missing

---------13:13----------
boards - I'm thinking Paul would

---------13:15----------
actually have a booth with his Alma so

---------13:17----------
that Tim and everybody could bring their

---------13:19----------
boards that have dead CPUs and Paul

---------13:20----------
could just replace them all do the event

---------13:22----------
in front of an apple store so when

---------13:23----------
customers buy a MacBook they could give

---------13:24----------
it to you to fix whoa that know what

---------13:29----------
Central Park what if we do the show live

---------13:31----------
in Central Park what if we do it right

---------13:33----------
across the street from the 59th Street

---------13:35----------
Apple store could I set up a little gas

---------13:37----------
powered or a battery powered soldering

---------13:40----------
set up right across the street from an

---------13:42----------
Apple store has anybody ever tried to

---------13:44----------
get a street permit for this that would

---------13:46----------
totally be worth getting a street permit

---------13:48----------
for let's see if this board works now

---------13:50----------
that we fixed our feedback let's see

---------13:52----------
there a street vendor inside here

---------13:53----------
because if there's a street vendor

---------13:55----------
inside here then that means that

---------13:56----------
somebody was allowed to get a permit so

---------13:59----------
I'm looking for like a hot dog vendor or

---------14:00----------
something wait here we go hot dog hot

---------14:02----------
dog okay how far is this dude from Apple

---------14:05----------
Store this guy was able to legally get a

---------14:07----------
permit BAM here we go here we go folks

---------14:11----------
that guy was able to legally get a

---------14:13----------
permit we got like a good six months for

---------14:15----------
this idea do it as a charity yeah you

---------14:17----------
know that would actually probably that

---------14:18----------
would make it easier to do that would

---------14:20----------
make it easier to do if we did it as a

---------14:21----------
charity okay so I need to get a street

---------14:24----------
permit to have Mike little cart my

---------14:27----------
little cart will be my macbook repair

---------14:29----------
cart

---------14:29----------
I'd have to invite Jessa I would need

---------14:31----------
Jessa to help me with the phone side of

---------14:33----------
things this could be good I think what

---------14:34----------
we could do is we could do a mobile cart

---------14:36----------
repair event and then we could also have

---------14:39----------
some sort of instead of doing a live

---------14:42----------
show we could have a little cart for the

---------14:44----------
repair event and then we could have some

---------14:46----------
sort of party nearby and then a party

---------14:48----------
would be the celebration of the 1

---------14:49----------
million and this now the funds from the

---------14:54----------
party let's say we charge 20 or 30 bucks

---------14:57----------
tit for the tickets for the party that

---------14:59----------
could fund the permit to have my little

---------15:03----------
live truck this is gonna be great

---------15:05----------
all right first let's see if we got a

---------15:06----------
backlight on here as you can see we have

---------15:08----------
a light on the screen meaning that our

---------15:10----------
little jumper wire has fixed this so the

---------15:13----------
feedback happened to blow up why the

---------15:15----------
blew up and there's no liquid damage or

---------15:17----------
no physical damage it's a Mac I can't

---------15:20----------
tell you that

---------15:20----------
but what I can do is run a jumper wire

---------15:22----------
and fix it for you take your money or if

---------15:26----------
you don't want to give me your money

---------15:27----------
because I'm a New York City jackass with

---------15:30----------
a douche bag accent you could follow the

---------15:32----------
instructions in my video and all the

---------15:33----------
other videos just like it that you'll

---------15:35----------
find down below and fix it yourself and

---------15:37----------
that's it for this one and I hope you

---------15:40----------
learned something

---------15:40----------
but Dad let's move on to the next

---------15:43----------
MacBook
