---------00:03----------
so let's figure out why this 11 inch

---------00:06----------
MacBook Air is not turning on we are

---------00:08----------
drawing seven milliamp that's no good

---------00:12----------
let's check on our pp bus looks like our

---------00:16----------
pp bus is 8 point 5 volts somebody said

---------00:22----------
I should do what label the stream ASMR

---------00:24----------
and talk like this do you think that's a

---------00:28----------
good idea or do you think that that's

---------00:29----------
just going to attract a bunch of a bunch

---------00:31----------
of yeah thank you

---------00:34----------
hi it's me Paul could you do it ASMR

---------00:43----------
chela I don't think so I think I'm gonna

---------00:50----------
do a you know I think we're gonna try

---------00:52----------
that for the next stream ASMR I will put

---------00:55----------
this microphone in the ultra start and

---------00:59----------
turn it on that's kind of bean all right

---------01:06----------
let's see what's wrong with this board

---------01:26----------
let's see if there's any corrosion on

---------01:28----------
this MacBook Airs we got to get the

---------01:31----------
microscope in focus under the CPU looks

---------01:36----------
to be good

---------01:40----------
RTC areas good DBS five one nine eight

---------01:44----------
zero areas good all right

---------01:52----------
let's go over to the upper right corner

---------01:55----------
SMC area looks fine

---------02:08----------
here we go I see something liquid it is

---------02:14----------
a liquid damage cap the hats a Texas

---------02:19----------
Instruments chip cd32 11 now the CD 32

---------02:23----------
15 is what they use for a thunderbolt

---------02:25----------
moxie it's almost likely this was an old

---------02:28----------
version of what they use for Thunderbolt

---------02:30----------
moxie

---------02:36----------
let's confirm that by opening up the

---------02:40----------
schematic

---------02:46----------
it is going to send your 15 volts for

---------02:50----------
thunderbolt into your 15 volts for

---------02:53----------
thunderbolt

---------02:56----------
thank you Tony tingles know what I think

---------03:02----------
so I don't get a short-circuit on PP 3 B

---------03:05----------
3 S 5 but I still feel the need to

---------03:07----------
remove something that looks like that

---------03:09----------
from the board

---------03:09----------
this sucks because if it didn't look

---------03:11----------
like that I'd never know that this is

---------03:13----------
where I should look see this is what I

---------03:16----------
say this is not this is janitorial work

---------03:19----------
this is not require some sort of genius

---------03:22----------
level intellect

---------03:24----------
this is pure janitor work I see

---------03:28----------
corrosion me remove corrosion me beat

---------03:32----------
chest and collect money

---------04:17----------
Thunderball can eat it

---------04:53----------
happy little solder joints yeah

---------04:59----------
beautiful happy little solder joints

---------05:02----------
okay we're gonna flow that into place as

---------05:05----------
we put the new capacitor on there it'll

---------05:07----------
be just fine

---------05:42----------
okay not only am I going to show you

---------05:44----------
that this bad boy turns on but we're

---------05:46----------
even if I can find a mini DisplayPort to

---------05:48----------
HDMI adapter I'll even be able to show

---------05:51----------
you that there's output on the screen

---------05:57----------
Paul I'll trade you this CD 32 11 for

---------06:00----------
that HDMI adapter fair trade

---------06:16----------
you've met spit that out you say I

---------06:23----------
up the plumbing you enjoyed the

---------06:36----------
wonderful Christmas music that is heard

---------06:37----------
everywhere can I ask why beautiful I'm

---------06:41----------
happy not only does it work it also

---------06:45----------
appears to have Thunderbolt so it looks

---------06:48----------
like our Thunderbolt MUX was messing

---------06:51----------
with our 3.3 volt rails and keeping the

---------06:53----------
machine from working as opposed was

---------06:55----------
supposed to but now it works is it

---------06:57----------
supposed to all we had to do is best

---------07:02----------
with the Thunderbolt circuit and that is

---------07:06----------
why this channel gets more live viewers

---------07:08----------
than Eli the computer guy
