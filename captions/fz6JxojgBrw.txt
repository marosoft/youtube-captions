---------00:00----------
koogler any oh yeah two gigs already

---------00:04----------
it's recording raw video because I can't

---------00:06----------
figure out how to make this program

---------00:07----------
compress properly so here we have an e

---------00:09----------
to zero 3437 motherboard from sunny here

---------00:13----------
and we have to see what's wrong with it

---------00:15----------
so well what have you measured so far

---------00:17----------
sunny so what have you noticed so what

---------00:26----------
what creates the s3's

---------00:32----------
what signal from the PCH creates the s

---------00:35----------
thérèse okay which which has three did

---------00:39----------
you measure that was missing p p3 p4 -

---------00:46----------
that's not an s3 p p3 v3 something

---------00:54----------
you're thinking maybe of p p3 v 3s 3p p3

---------01:00----------
v 3 s 3 maybe that was what you were

---------01:01----------
thinking about then let's try and find

---------01:03----------
that that's open board view that

---------01:09----------
actually works get this I can see what's

---------01:15----------
there

---------01:17----------
okay now P P 3 V 3 s 3 what creates this

---------01:28----------
let's see

---------01:36----------
P P 3 P 3 s 3 comes from P P 3 B 3 s 5

---------01:40----------
over here hmm alright so you said P P 3

---------01:44----------
B 3 as 5 as present yes okay so what's

---------01:49----------
going to turn this on P 3 V 3 s 3

---------01:51----------
underscore enable did you check for that

---------01:55----------
this company you don't have that on your

---------01:58----------
schematic you should go to your

---------01:59----------
schematic provider and complain about

---------02:01----------
that

---------02:01----------
all right so P P 3 P 3 B 3 s 3 and they

---------02:04----------
enable comes from p.m. sleep best for L

---------02:06----------
let's see if we have pm sleep s4l all

---------02:16----------
right so we have a bunch of different

---------02:17----------
places here that we can measure pm sleep

---------02:20----------
s4l all right

---------02:29----------
PM sleep s4l I'm paying back my debt to

---------02:35----------
sunny from the iPhone screens and we

---------02:38----------
have 0 so p.m. sleep best for all comes

---------02:40----------
from what sunny yeah actually

---------02:48----------
so what are we charge a day we can

---------02:52----------
prorated for a two hours yeah so how

---------02:55----------
about we just leave it even instead of

---------02:56----------
me owing you 4 iPhone screens you owe me

---------02:58----------
like 200 bucks yeah that's yeah steven

---------03:13----------
steve' is the reason my credit score is

---------03:15----------
what it is okay so p.m. sleeve s for all

---------03:19----------
comes from the PCH and what tells the

---------03:22----------
PCH what to do what tells the PCH what

---------03:30----------
to do

---------03:36----------
boy okay when you have a PC computer and

---------03:43----------
you want to overclock it or do something

---------03:44----------
with it

---------03:44----------
whoa what what else huh the BIOS tells

---------03:48----------
all what to do okay so here let's let's

---------03:51----------
let's see what

---------04:02----------
what does your BIOS area look like sunny

---------04:12----------
doesn't look too bad

---------04:18----------
 and balls all right so let's see

---------04:21----------
what are those two supposed to measure

---------04:23----------
here those four so the two on the top of

---------04:26----------
the ones that are really nasty nice we

---------04:28----------
have our 6126 and i 6125 so let's go to

---------04:32----------
our 6126 our six one two six and our six

---------04:39----------
one two five those are supposed to both

---------04:40----------
be forty three ohms let's see if we get

---------04:43----------
forty three ohms

---------04:48----------
Who am I kidding you're not gonna see

---------04:51----------
that on the camera anyway so let's see

---------04:53----------
ooo

---------04:59----------
forty three arms and forty three arms

---------05:05----------
imagine that Oh

---------05:35----------
now look at the chip that's responsible

---------05:37----------
for P P 3 B 3 s 5 look at that nasty

---------05:40----------
capacitor and the bottom left and also

---------05:44----------
look at that little corroded point over

---------05:47----------
there let's see what that's for p5 vp 3

---------05:58----------
V 3 V reg 3 that's C 7503 that looks

---------06:03----------
like so and also above it so this

---------06:11----------
that resistor P 3 B 3 s 5 en are B's

---------06:16----------
that's that's PP 3 V 3 is 5 is that

---------06:18----------
actually here yes Adobe I know your PDF

---------06:23----------
reader is useless as PDF reader is

---------06:25----------
available and I don't care alright so

---------06:28----------
let's see this PP 3 V 3 s 5 actually

---------06:31----------
here this is starting to be look a

---------06:35----------
little hard to believe

---------06:48----------
and it's not there something you lied

---------06:53----------
sorry you lied you lied look at

---------06:58----------
the what do you mean it's there mofo hey

---------07:04----------
that is five is not there what's this

---------07:09----------
your multimeter measures voltage when

---------07:11----------
you have the probes in the air

---------07:13----------
okay mofo zing it's time to erase some

---------07:22----------
nasty all right

---------07:24----------
P P 3 P 3 s 5 is needed for the PC H to

---------07:27----------
send out anything because that all

---------07:28----------
rubber work some 3.3 volt logic and 3.3

---------07:30----------
volts is provided by P P 3 P 3 is 5 your

---------07:35----------
multimeter measures voltage in the air

---------07:36----------
son okay that stuff looks like I'm

---------07:46----------
not really gonna bother looking into it

---------07:48----------
what a lot of that stuff does when I can

---------07:49----------
just it'll take more brainpower to

---------07:51----------
figure out what that does then the brain

---------07:53----------
power required you just simply take it

---------07:54----------
off I need to conserve my brain

---------08:13----------
give it another second heat up doner

---------08:22----------
pile this thing is a monster it's a

---------08:36----------
monster what

---------08:47----------
I don't think it is but I don't care I

---------08:51----------
don't feel like replacing that stuff and

---------08:53----------
plugging it back in just to realize that

---------08:54----------
a two-cent component that I didn't

---------08:57----------
replace is also bet so these two can go

---------09:03----------
see yeah let's see how this is nasty on

---------09:05----------
the screen sunny but I'm tweezing if

---------09:09----------
that exploded what do you think happens

---------09:11----------
to the chip that that it's going to

---------09:15----------
probably something nasty all right look

---------09:18----------
at it go Weller all righty I love father

---------09:23----------
didn't give me a plunger with this flux

---------09:26----------
yeah since I've wanted to review it and

---------09:32----------
I kind of liked it so I didn't return it

---------09:35----------
there's no need to return it I think

---------09:37----------
it's really cool and as this this this

---------09:40----------
is the the awesome tip I don't want to

---------09:42----------
ruin your shoes sunny they look really

---------09:43----------
cool okay all right look at this thing

---------09:45----------
this blade this blade is awesome so

---------09:52----------
we're just gonna revitalize pads that

---------09:55----------
look nasty

---------10:02----------
see we create a little bridge over that

---------10:04----------
section that's destroyed angry iPhone

---------10:15----------
customers oh well 2005 it does it have

---------10:33----------
colors on it

---------10:33----------
I mean is it though is the iMac that has

---------10:40----------
the coloring like with the TV looking

---------10:42----------


---------10:55----------
this will scrape away the trace a little

---------10:57----------
here

---------11:24----------
let's get the dirt to get sucked up onto

---------11:26----------
the iron and away from the board

---------11:31----------
all right

---------11:35----------
this thing is a monster man

---------11:37----------
well er WH a 900 monster

---------12:04----------
well sure foot

---------13:16----------
I love this little jagged edge tip it's

---------13:18----------
my new favorite tip if you want to do

---------13:21----------
point and do something really fine you

---------13:23----------
can just use the edge of it like this

---------13:24----------
but then if you want a lot of thermal

---------13:26----------
meant you know you have some with a lot

---------13:27----------
of thermal mass and you just want to get

---------13:29----------
rid of a bridge you can just hold it on

---------13:30----------
the side so you don't have to keep

---------13:32----------
changing your tips for the application

---------13:33----------
that does everything all in one yeah

---------13:39----------
look I mean it removed the huge bridge

---------13:41----------
and it's a it's a micro pencil a little

---------13:44----------
45 watt 48 wide actually tiny little 65

---------13:50----------
there well look micro pencil is 65 and

---------13:53----------
then the regular one is 80

---------13:54----------
this one is 65 for the big iron and 48

---------13:57----------
for the tiny one but it doesn't matter

---------13:59----------
it still does like it works this like

---------14:01----------
here

---------14:08----------
moving the tiny components with the

---------14:09----------
larger nozzle is harder it still doesn't

---------14:38----------
I don't want any of them though those

---------14:40----------
screens that you got that Tony doesn't

---------14:42----------
like we Wade you buy those screens that

---------14:46----------
Tony doesn't like again why doesn't he

---------14:50----------
like them

---------15:13----------
that sounds very e-tec of them you know

---------15:19----------
I hear they took on somebody from e-tec

---------15:21----------
recently maybe the quality maybe the

---------15:26----------
quality came over huh oh yeah by other

---------15:30----------
one broke I had somebody asked

---------15:32----------
water use that pee that funny though

---------15:33----------
coat hanger one so I did a video

---------15:35----------
comparing the microphones and I said the

---------15:36----------
DPA is the best and I'm always going to

---------15:38----------
be using this and it literally died

---------15:39----------
after the video there was some

---------15:54----------
outsourcing that Bertha that almost

---------15:56----------
caused sunny store to get broken into

---------16:08----------
yeah

---------16:12----------
and now this one over here doesn't look

---------16:13----------
very nice that has to get covered in

---------16:16----------
cider aesthetic all right we still

---------16:22----------
probably have more work to go but at

---------16:25----------
least let's see if PP 3v3 es5 is back

---------16:28----------
that would be nice but yeah PP 3 B 3 s 5

---------16:32----------
of course we do because we have a fan

---------16:35----------
spin a fan spin Steve what are you

---------16:39----------
invoicing sunny for this

---------16:41----------
how many iPhone 6 screens do we take and

---------16:44----------
like prorate it let's see what does open

---------16:46----------
broadcaster say for board repair lesson

---------16:48----------
a 25 minutes of sunny yes sudden death

---------16:59----------
syndrome sudden death by liquid

---------17:01----------
that yeah it's crazy how when you spill

---------17:10----------
liquid on and they just stop working why

---------17:15----------
doesn't make the chip even on the board

---------17:17----------
since you're gonna be paying whatever is

---------17:19----------
ridiculous rate Steve has for you on the

---------17:21----------
invoice let's make the chip straight

---------17:33----------
this thing goes really hot

---------17:38----------
look at how high that goes in here Sonny

---------17:47----------
you know what me trying to move this

---------17:49----------
over and make it straighter just gonna

---------17:50----------
wind up killing it so that's a bad idea

---------17:53----------
that thing's a beast alright so

---------18:01----------
what was even wrong I didn't even bother

---------18:02----------
looking on the schematic to see what was

---------18:03----------
actually wrong with it let's see

---------18:06----------
so the caps that were look nasty looking

---------18:09----------
were what are they for you know how much

---------18:12----------
time I could have saved if you just told

---------18:13----------
me PB 3 B 3 X 5 was it there so let's

---------18:16----------
see C 75 okay so this over here C 7 503

---------18:23----------
this is for the LDO inside the chip then

---------18:28----------
that capacitors going between that and

---------18:34----------
ground hmm that's odd why that should

---------18:39----------
not be critical well I guess if the hmm

---------18:47----------
let's look in context here

---------18:53----------
yeah I'm really not sure why that would

---------18:55----------
be critical let's see maybe it just

---------19:01----------
means that chip itself has it had

---------19:03----------
exploded our so in fine I almost want to

---------19:06----------
go back in time and unfix it and see but

---------19:08----------
yeah our seven five five to as five

---------19:11----------
power enable so that resistor being

---------19:13----------
burned definitely would have done

---------19:14----------
something here are seven five five to

---------19:16----------
via the chip would have been told to

---------19:18----------
turn on the chip itself is probably bad

---------19:19----------
so yeah that's that you go to Steve to

---------19:24----------
pay your invoice
