---------00:00----------
hi so today we're working on an 820 3115

---------00:03----------
board and the problem with this board is

---------00:04----------
that it is dead so i plug the charger in

---------00:07----------
and when i plug the charger in i get a

---------00:09----------
green light but I get no fan spinning

---------00:11----------
and it should be pretty obvious why if

---------00:13----------
you take a look under the microscope

---------00:14----------
here and you get a night a little bit of

---------00:16----------
an idea of what's going on so just to

---------00:19----------
give you some context of what I'm

---------00:21----------
looking at here that is that's gross I

---------00:25----------
mean there's really no other way to put

---------00:27----------
it that is just nasty and this is around

---------00:30----------
the current sensing area for the ISL

---------00:32----------
6259 so that is for the area if you are

---------00:36----------
interested in learning i would suggest

---------00:37----------
looking up previous video that i've done

---------00:39----------
on what current sensing is and what that

---------00:42----------
has to do in a circuit because i just

---------00:44----------
not going to go through the schematic

---------00:46----------
right now i do have a lot of things to

---------00:48----------
catch up on since just getting back from

---------00:49----------
a class from practical board repair

---------00:51----------
school I have done videos on current

---------00:53----------
sensing issues before so if you do want

---------00:55----------
to learn go back and see what is current

---------00:59----------
sensing and why does it stop my battery

---------01:01----------
from charging in this case it's not just

---------01:03----------
stopping the battery from charging it's

---------01:04----------
keeping the machine from turning on all

---------01:06----------
together so current sensing is going to

---------01:08----------
be something that allows the machine to

---------01:09----------
tell how much amperage the charger or

---------01:13----------
the battery is using in this case the

---------01:14----------
battery and forced when it's really

---------01:17----------
really messed up it's actually going to

---------01:18----------
keep the computer from turning on even

---------01:20----------
using the charger so this obviously was

---------01:22----------
never ultrasonic and here's the thing

---------01:25----------
with the machines that have never been

---------01:26----------
ultra sonic usually I don't work on them

---------01:28----------
but since this is lem limited corrosion

---------01:30----------
in a limited area I will work on it and

---------01:32----------
then I will ultrasonic afterwards just

---------01:35----------
to save myself a trip to the ultrasonic

---------01:37----------
so what I do here is I actually

---------01:38----------
ultrasonic these machines after I'm done

---------01:41----------
working on them so that the customer

---------01:42----------
doesn't see a complete flux mess if 1501

---------01:45----------
time permits and when somebody li can

---------01:48----------
when it's practical to do so so first

---------01:52----------
thing I'm going to do here is just put

---------01:53----------
some flux get the hot air station revved

---------01:55----------
up and we're just going to do what I

---------01:57----------
like to do in these cases which is what

---------01:59----------
i like to call it hitting delete so this

---------02:02----------
is a mess and i fully intend to just hit

---------02:04----------
the lead on it which means i'm not going

---------02:06----------
to measure components i'm just going to

---------02:08----------
go ahead and start erasing them so i'm

---------02:11----------
going to

---------02:12----------
put some flux on there get the hot air

---------02:15----------
going and remove remove remove remove

---------02:28----------
move goodbye goodbye goodbye

---------02:44----------
like the end of Pink Floyd's the wall

---------02:45----------
yes goodbye goodbye goodbye

---------03:05----------
okay let's move that little cat back in

---------03:07----------
a place

---------03:59----------
you'll see the magic secret to getting

---------04:01----------
this to look finished at the end so my

---------04:08----------
ability to play small components is

---------04:09----------
about as good as my art projects were in

---------04:13----------
fourth grade my dioramas anybody

---------04:25----------
remember dioramas you have to tell the

---------04:26----------
story inside of a shoebox and build

---------04:28----------
and draw things and yeah something like

---------04:32----------
I don't think that I'm not a creative

---------04:34----------
person when it comes to ideas I just

---------04:36----------
suck at building dioramas and there's

---------04:38----------
really nothing you can do to make me

---------04:40----------
better at it so it'd just be nice if you

---------04:44----------
would stop being cruel and if you could

---------04:47----------
not force me to make a diorama

---------05:06----------
so I just take off of the spare boards

---------05:09----------
and you'll see what i'm going to do with

---------05:10----------
the flux in a minute it's going to allow

---------05:12----------
all those components to flow in a place

---------05:14----------
very nicely it all starts with finding a

---------05:17----------
few boards that have not been completely

---------05:19----------
robbed most of the boards that I have in

---------05:21----------
my collection here have been completely

---------05:23----------
robbed so

---------05:39----------
no am I kidding hi I

---------06:14----------
that's awful

---------06:35----------
you're going to see in a second how I

---------06:37----------
make awful work for me magic

---------06:58----------
except for that one that needs some

---------07:00----------
solder on the pad look at past but that

---------07:03----------
just tried to fly away

---------07:17----------
whole idea here is to get all this stuff

---------07:19----------
flowed into place

---------07:26----------
no star from far away and move in

---------07:44----------
now that's looking pretty good i think

---------07:46----------
it's looking a lot better than it looked

---------07:49----------
a second ago and i think from what it

---------07:52----------
looks like that there's a chance that

---------07:53----------
this actually may work this is monkey

---------08:02----------
see monkey do kind of board repair this

---------08:06----------
is where a lot of people are going to be

---------08:07----------
starting so you're not gonna actually

---------08:09----------
know what the problem is but you'll just

---------08:11----------
see something that looks messed up and

---------08:13----------
you'll think whom I probably shouldn't

---------08:15----------
keep that thing on there because it

---------08:16----------
looks messed up let me see what I can do

---------08:17----------
about it and that's how you're gonna fix

---------08:22----------
the board it's not and this isn't always

---------08:24----------
going to work but you learn something

---------08:29----------
along the way maybe you'll look at the

---------08:31----------
areas that are commonly affected and you

---------08:34----------
know you'll look up what they are and

---------08:35----------
then you'll see whom I don't know what

---------08:36----------
that is let me look up what this is I

---------08:38----------
see a series of these resistors in this

---------08:40----------
configuration and another one that looks

---------08:42----------
like this you know maybe you'll find a

---------08:45----------
website that's explained it to you or a

---------08:46----------
book that explains it to you and then

---------08:47----------
then you'll kind of a natural organic

---------08:50----------
way of learning I'm just tidying up a

---------08:53----------
little bit to my office so it doesn't

---------08:54----------
become a mess as I work never mind that

---------08:56----------
so let's see so I'm going to plug the

---------08:58----------
charger and we'll see if we have any

---------08:59----------
difference from what we had just a

---------09:00----------
second ago so I have a green light and

---------09:04----------
the fan is spinning man that's

---------09:09----------
that's a beautiful beautiful thing still

---------09:12----------
spinning actually so this definitely has

---------09:13----------
to go into the ultrasonic cleaner

---------09:14----------
because it had liquid on it and also now

---------09:17----------
ahead flux on it so just to show you a

---------09:19----------
little bit on the schematic because I

---------09:21----------
feel bad not showing you a current

---------09:22----------
sensing is again I'm not going to

---------09:23----------
explain it in detail here but I will

---------09:25----------
explain just a little bit of it so that

---------09:28----------
you can get an idea of what it is I'm

---------09:30----------
talking about ok so let's go to

---------09:33----------
broadcast or have to plug the open

---------09:35----------
broadcaster dedicated monitoring so

---------09:37----------
these are the resistors right are 7051

---------09:40----------
and are 7052 so you have Q 7055 to and

---------09:43----------
from the battery this is a current

---------09:45----------
sensing resistor before the battery goes

---------09:46----------
to the computer there's a resistor right

---------09:48----------
over here there'll be a small voltage

---------09:49----------
drop across the resistor and the voltage

---------09:51----------
drop across the resistor is going to be

---------09:52----------
dependent on how much

---------09:54----------
ambridge how much power the system is

---------09:55----------
using now the ISL 6259 is in the circuit

---------09:58----------
so it can't read you know we can it

---------10:00----------
doesn't have its hand in the circuit it

---------10:02----------
can't see how much current is flowing

---------10:03----------
through the circuit think of it like a

---------10:04----------
stream you know you're you're in a

---------10:06----------
street you want to know how much current

---------10:08----------
is flowing through the stream and how

---------10:10----------
fast it's flowing you can't play from

---------10:12----------
the mountaintop you can't just look at

---------10:14----------
it and tell how much it is you need to

---------10:15----------
have a friend that's down there and that

---------10:17----------
friend can then report to you how fast

---------10:19----------
the current is moving through the stream

---------10:20----------
when he has his hand in it think of this

---------10:21----------
current sensing resistor so our 7050 is

---------10:24----------
the hand right are 70 50 here is your

---------10:27----------
friend with the hand there and these two

---------10:30----------
resistors are 70 51 and r7 250 to that

---------10:32----------
were that's going between the

---------10:34----------
hand and this so think of those like the

---------10:36----------
cell phone that your friend is using to

---------10:38----------
call you on the mountain and say here's

---------10:39----------
how fast the water is going so that's

---------10:41----------
reporting back to the ISL 6259 that

---------10:43----------
controls the charging circuit in the

---------10:44----------
computer you know should I turn on and

---------10:47----------
that's that
