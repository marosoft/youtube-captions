---------00:00----------
look at look at it look at it what the

---------00:03----------
[ __ ] did they do holy [ __ ] what what the

---------00:09----------
[ __ ] hell is this pull the [ __ ]

---------00:11----------
what the [ __ ] why the [ __ ] [ __ ] oh I'm

---------00:16----------
live hi probably so what do I have here

---------00:23----------
for today I get all the easy ones so

---------00:26----------
give a 15:30 for the bane of our

---------00:31----------
existence this this machine is just

---------00:33----------
trashed and what does it do plug it in

---------00:39----------
you get nothing now something you should

---------00:44----------
always do with these with all of the

---------00:45----------
ones that take the USBC reverse your

---------00:48----------
charging port

---------00:50----------
so what's plugged in like that just turn

---------00:51----------
it around cuz there's two data lines on

---------00:53----------
there CC 1 CC 2 so you'll want to see if

---------00:56----------
it works the opposite direction and

---------00:58----------
nothing absolutely nothing so that

---------01:03----------
that's different because it it should be

---------01:05----------
giving it 5 volts how does anything know

---------01:07----------
to turn on unless it gets 5 volts so it

---------01:10----------
should have some kind of grounding or

---------01:12----------
something or to just give us at least 5

---------01:15----------
volts so we have nothing so let's see

---------01:18----------
what we have going on inside here then

---------01:20----------
[Applause]

---------01:21----------
so opening these is very tricky if you

---------01:25----------
haven't done it before when you open it

---------01:27----------
you got to be very careful of the

---------01:29----------
keyboard and trackpad cable that's stuck

---------01:31----------
in here let's see

---------01:34----------
get my fat hand in here to pop the lock

---------01:38----------
and there you go so now we have the

---------01:44----------
awful tiny iPhone size board everything

---------01:47----------
on this desk has a place and everything

---------01:50----------
is in its place that's just how my mind

---------01:53----------
works I know where everything is

---------01:55----------
say again rubber pieces we have rubber

---------02:01----------
pieces everywhere rubber pieces are very

---------02:03----------
important I find these on the floor

---------02:04----------
sometimes oh my god it drives me nuts

---------02:06----------
[Applause]

---------02:08----------
okay so we have this tiny little board

---------02:11----------
here so first thing to do is let's

---------02:13----------
disconnect all the peripherals and

---------02:15----------
everything off of here so let's

---------02:17----------
disconnect the battery I had I have no

---------02:19----------
battery light there's a little tiny LED

---------02:21----------
here and it's gonna glow just a tiny

---------02:22----------
little bit if the battery was charged

---------02:25----------
and working so that's either the battery

---------02:27----------
is dead or we have a problem with that

---------02:29----------
power line on the board itself so that

---------02:32----------
is to be determined later the easiest

---------02:36----------
way to disconnect peripherals off of

---------02:38----------
this is just take the whole board out

---------02:41----------
it's only a couple screws be careful

---------02:45----------
when lifting the LCD connector cap you

---------02:50----------
might pop off on in one of these little

---------02:51----------
resistors let's disconnect the audio

---------02:54----------
board and headphone cord speakers

---------03:00----------
the audio board can cause problems on

---------03:02----------
the board itself short powerlines out

---------03:06----------
let's just take the board right out of

---------03:08----------
here now we have our tiny little board

---------03:11----------
[Applause]

---------03:13----------
our sad little metal board

---------03:19----------
so now I have a known good test charge

---------03:23----------
port so now we've taken everything out

---------03:25----------
of the machine all the peripherals that

---------03:27----------
could be just easily changed out of the

---------03:28----------
equation and let's see if we have

---------03:32----------
anything going on here I get nothing

---------03:38----------
let's turn the charge port around I

---------03:42----------
still get nothing okay so let's go

---------03:50----------
straight to a visual inspection okay so

---------03:57----------
uh I see something a little wrong here

---------04:00----------
something some doesn't look good here

---------04:10----------
so yeah that this this stuff should not

---------04:17----------
look like that that is remnants of magic

---------04:22----------
smoke let's see if we could see

---------04:25----------
underneath it

---------04:30----------
can I get an angle

---------04:43----------
can't really see underneath it but that

---------04:47----------
greasiness right there that is the

---------04:51----------
remnants of magic smoke being led let

---------04:53----------
out of this poor sad cd32 15 beyond so I

---------05:03----------
think we should just start there and

---------05:05----------
remove this little CD 3215 these two

---------05:09----------
lines right here that you're seeing

---------05:11----------
coming in here with the two caps the the

---------05:14----------
resistors are no stuff they're not

---------05:15----------
supposed to be there but the this is the

---------05:17----------
CC 1 CC 2 that's the data lines that the

---------05:21----------
CD 32:15 uses to talk to the charger so

---------05:24----------
CC 1 is enacted if it's you know right

---------05:28----------
side up CC 2 is enacted if it's upside

---------05:30----------
down so you you can have if one of these

---------05:34----------
capacitors shorts to ground you can have

---------05:36----------
the charger work one way and not the

---------05:37----------
other way let's take this guy over here

---------05:46----------
unfortunately there's no good way to

---------05:47----------
save this stuff this this fabric if you

---------05:51----------
try just putting some captain tape on it

---------05:53----------
it just comes off with the captain tape

---------05:55----------
when you try to pull it off maybe I've

---------05:57----------
never tried removing it before I solder

---------06:00----------
and then trying to put it back let's see

---------06:03----------
if that works

---------06:03----------
I always feel bad burning this stuff up

---------06:10----------
if Lois was watching this he would yell

---------06:12----------
at me for trying to even save it

---------06:20----------
okay well it's coming up

---------06:30----------
did I can put that back later

---------06:34----------
but then someplace safe

---------06:38----------
okay turn on my fume extractor

---------06:40----------
[Applause]

---------06:44----------
let's get a little bit of folks the

---------06:48----------
right amount of flux removing a chip

---------06:56----------
and my wider tweezers to fit a CD 3215

---------06:59----------
between them

---------07:01----------
let's go a heat

---------07:13----------
so this board even though it's so small

---------07:16----------
it's very tricky to work on with heat

---------07:19----------
the whole board is a heat sink

---------07:39----------
ooh that looks like a burnt-up board on

---------07:41----------
right there

---------07:42----------
[Applause]

---------07:47----------
okay we might have to do some rebuilding

---------07:49----------
here clean it all off and see what we

---------07:52----------
got

---------08:21----------
[Applause]

---------09:04----------
Oh God

---------09:08----------
Oh God

---------09:13----------
pathetic management oh god that's a lot

---------09:19----------
of carbon in there okay so we have to

---------09:23----------
get rid of the carbon a burnt-up bored

---------09:25----------
carbonized layers turned into resistors

---------09:27----------
and they short things out so I'm gonna

---------09:30----------
take a tiny dental tool here and just

---------09:33----------
start digging away so we don't need all

---------09:37----------
of this does this this can all just go

---------09:39----------
because this is just ground

---------09:52----------
let me get an exacto I'm gonna need a

---------09:54----------
fresh exacto blade

---------09:56----------
[Applause]

---------10:15----------
[Applause]

---------10:18----------
I'm just gonna cut away all this ground

---------10:21----------
plane here

---------10:25----------
clean out all underneath it

---------10:50----------
so we didn't go into any layers it looks

---------10:52----------
like

---------11:04----------
what I could also do is ultrasonic it

---------11:07----------
for a little while because the the

---------11:09----------
carbonized stuff tends to melt away in

---------11:12----------
the ultrasonic sometimes

---------11:35----------
now I want to go to the schematic and I

---------11:37----------
want to find out what this ball here is

---------11:39----------
these just connect it here here here

---------11:42----------
here so that's going to be easy to

---------11:43----------
rebuild this one right here I want to

---------11:48----------
know what it is and where it goes to

---------11:51----------
I want to omit out to ground and other

---------11:53----------
things and make sure that there's no

---------11:54----------
carbon in here along side of it going

---------11:57----------
all the way down

---------12:11----------
Oh open up Paul Daniels bored view

---------12:14----------
software

---------12:20----------
open up my board view for the eight two

---------12:23----------
zero zero zero two four four 1534 board

---------12:42----------
say that's three down and their peepee

---------12:47----------
bus left I oh okay that's shared with a

---------12:52----------
bunch of them right there okay

---------12:59----------
I don't know why they didn't do it on

---------13:01----------
top but this this this this you could

---------13:04----------
see that these are connected and then

---------13:07----------
this is also connected that's all the

---------13:08----------
same thing about the one below it

---------13:17----------
DP v es 4

---------13:21----------
okay let me all check them

---------13:25----------
[Applause]

---------13:35----------
than wine it's good

---------13:44----------
twenty-one Killa homes that sounds right

---------13:46----------
for AP by ps4

---------13:52----------
so I think we're gonna be good here I

---------13:54----------
just need to rebuild those to get rid of

---------13:58----------
this little

---------14:05----------
let's get rebuilding so I'm gonna attach

---------14:09----------
a wire to this little bit that's left I

---------14:12----------
want to leave the other pad alone so

---------14:17----------
let's clean this up get all the solder

---------14:21----------
mask off of each one of these

---------14:39----------
[Applause]

---------14:44----------
a little bit of flux

---------14:46----------
take my micro pencil and get some solder

---------14:49----------
on that

---------15:09----------
okay

---------15:11----------
[Applause]

---------15:16----------
I need some jumper wire

---------15:23----------
to melt it away yeah took some bored

---------15:32----------
with it it's only one layer

---------15:42----------
oh sure just want to make some make the

---------15:50----------
stream more interesting

---------15:59----------
before I took the chip off I dug

---------16:01----------
underneath it and then I put the chip

---------16:04----------
back on so that it would be like that

---------16:18----------
[Applause]

---------16:19----------
and I'll give that a little bit of space

---------16:22----------
cut it off

---------16:30----------
[Applause]

---------16:55----------
[Applause]

---------17:07----------
[Applause]

---------17:57----------
and I turned my jumper wire into a

---------17:59----------
little hoop and that's gonna make sure

---------18:03----------
that it captures the ball on the chip

---------18:06----------
and the ball doesn't leak over anywhere

---------18:08----------
else if you just put a straight wire

---------18:10----------
here the ball when it when the chip

---------18:12----------
settles down the ball might roll over

---------18:14----------
and short out to here or short out to

---------18:16----------
here so I'd like to turn it into a

---------18:18----------
little loop so the ball is gonna sit

---------18:20----------
right in the center and nothing else is

---------18:21----------
gonna happen to it

---------18:22----------
I'll stay right there

---------18:30----------
just give the wire a little scrape to

---------18:32----------
get the coating off of it

---------18:43----------
there's a new pod there

---------18:49----------
do the same thing for this one

---------19:50----------
now I will dunk it in the ultrasonic

---------19:52----------
cleaner to get rid of all the flux I

---------19:55----------
don't want to hit this with a q-tip with

---------20:00----------
alcohol because that that's just gonna

---------20:02----------
ruin our wires there oh wait let me do a

---------20:04----------
little bit of scraping on that first

---------20:15----------
so now although you see one moment

---------20:18----------
please

---------20:24----------
talk about too tired I spent all day

---------20:26----------
yesterday rebuilding the brakes on my

---------20:27----------
truck I had my brake system fail out on

---------20:30----------
route 22 when somebody pulled out in

---------20:32----------
front of me and I panicked stopped the

---------20:35----------
whole developed in the brake line and it

---------20:37----------
just popped out and I lost my brakes I

---------20:40----------
got a tow truck i downshift it to avoid

---------20:45----------
smacking into him no no I can't put my

---------20:50----------
foot down on the ground not not for a

---------20:52----------
6,000 pound pickup truck

---------21:03----------
and put a dot of conformal coating over

---------21:07----------
here to work with and I could

---------21:14----------
cook this stuff up protect all of us

---------21:31----------
go over the soldering point so make sure

---------21:35----------
that it stays in place go all around the

---------21:41----------
bottom of it

---------21:45----------
doesn't matter if you get some on it

---------21:50----------
there's no mistakes just happy accidents

---------22:07----------
so flux doesn't like to I mean I'm

---------22:09----------
solder doesn't like to touch this

---------22:11----------
conformal coating it kind of like just

---------22:13----------
rolls right off of it so I like to any

---------22:16----------
any damaged balls any work that I've

---------22:18----------
done I like to put it in between it and

---------22:20----------
it just makes absolutely certain that it

---------22:23----------
the ball isn't going to slide over and

---------22:25----------
try to combine with the stuff next to it

---------22:35----------
you have to worry about getting getting

---------22:37----------
it on here we could scrape it off before

---------22:39----------
we put the chip now

---------22:45----------
okay now we take our near UV laser just

---------22:53----------
give it a couple seconds

---------23:35----------
[Applause]

---------23:47----------
just a little bit of scraping scrape on

---------23:49----------
here

---------23:54----------
take your knife nice gentle strokes

---------24:06----------
we have happy little paths

---------24:11----------
a happy little padlet right there

---------24:19----------
now I want to turn them

---------24:22----------
a little bit of flux just the right

---------24:25----------
amount of flux you want too much

---------24:34----------
the micro pencil and

---------24:37----------
happy little amount of solder right

---------24:41----------
there there you go

---------24:54----------
[Applause]

---------25:02----------
[Applause]

---------25:20----------
I want to build up a little bit more

---------25:23----------
conformal coating between these two

---------25:26----------
damaged along the sphere this is a low

---------25:32----------
spot right here

---------25:37----------
I just want to pull that

---------25:49----------
alligator clips are by the flux

---------25:53----------
alligator clips have been moved to by

---------25:55----------
the flux that's like an emergency stash

---------25:59----------
that's an emergency stash

---------26:03----------
[Applause]

---------26:12----------
like our happy blue light

---------26:16----------
just cure that painter

---------26:27----------
[Applause]

---------26:37----------
so there

---------26:38----------
I think we're ready for a chip I don't

---------26:41----------
know if I need to flatten some more

---------26:42----------
stuff out we'll see how the chip lays

---------26:44----------
when I put it down

---------26:52----------
so let me find my happy little CD 32:15

---------26:58----------
[Applause]

---------27:05----------
[Applause]

---------27:12----------
here a happy CD 3215

---------27:16----------
the bo3

---------27:46----------
I happy cd32 15

---------27:51----------
and I like when Apple uses these these

---------27:54----------
type of chips they refuse to put any

---------27:56----------
markings on the boards for even where

---------27:58----------
pin one is or anything but they can't

---------28:00----------
help it with this one because it has a

---------28:02----------
missing pin a missing ball there so you

---------28:08----------
can always know which way to put it

---------28:14----------
let's see how this fits here

---------28:17----------
it seemed like it's staying on the bed

---------28:19----------
oh that's perfect see that the the two

---------28:21----------
little hoops I made is capturing those

---------28:23----------
two balls and just everything is staying

---------28:25----------
perfectly so now I'll add some flux

---------28:45----------
there it is

---------28:51----------
it seems too close over here

---------29:12----------
I'll just heat this right on

---------29:36----------
I got ship dance a little bit

---------29:42----------
then go happy cd32 15 on a happy little

---------29:46----------
MacBook Ford

---------29:52----------
that's my microscope once every time

---------29:55----------
somebody walks through the room

---------30:04----------
[Applause]

---------30:10----------
just give a test on CC 1 CC to make sure

---------30:13----------
that those balls didn't connect

---------30:17----------
[Applause]

---------30:19----------
why is it telling me that connected I

---------30:21----------
don't like that

---------30:30----------
[Applause]

---------30:51----------
and you really cannot see in this one

---------30:55----------
[Applause]

---------31:14----------
[Applause]

---------31:21----------
the multimeters telling you that they're

---------31:23----------
shorted together I don't think they're

---------31:24----------
supposed to be

---------31:29----------
should have checked that before I even

---------31:31----------
put the chip on

---------31:36----------
well let's try it

---------31:41----------
if that didn't work I'll have to pull it

---------31:43----------
up and put more conformal coating on it

---------31:52----------
yeah that did not work

---------32:00----------
CC 1 CC 2 are shorted together so the

---------32:03----------
jumpers that I put on there shorted

---------32:06----------
themselves together I didn't pile up

---------32:07----------
enough conformal coating between the two

---------32:11----------
[Applause]

---------32:13----------
so off with your chip

---------32:50----------
let's test that

---------32:53----------
without the chip on

---------32:56----------
they are not shorted they're not

---------32:58----------
supposed to be short of what the chip on

---------33:00----------
either so these two balls that's why one

---------33:04----------
ball is huge because they connect it

---------33:06----------
together

---------33:13----------
so I need to build up a wall of

---------33:15----------
conformal coating between the two

---------33:28----------
[Applause]

---------34:04----------
turn this

---------34:14----------
[Applause]

---------34:16----------
take her happy gugak

---------34:19----------
clean up all of this solder Charlotte

---------34:23----------
ads are nice and flat

---------34:38----------
what are you working on

---------34:44----------
he's recovered an iPhone X awesome

---------34:50----------
Camile over here is just crushing the

---------34:52----------
iPhones

---------35:18----------
[Applause]

---------35:20----------
I got to be careful now this one is

---------35:23----------
starting only lift a little bit it's

---------35:25----------
loose

---------35:30----------
so I don't want to rub on this I'm going

---------35:31----------
to put this in the ultrasonic cleaner

---------35:40----------
this is one thing about wyck and castor

---------35:45----------
sada is that the flux that is inside the

---------35:49----------
gugak inside the castor solder this

---------35:52----------
turns into a bit of a hard rock when you

---------35:56----------
use it so sometimes it the ultrasonic

---------35:59----------
won't quickly wash it away

---------36:01----------
so here I'm going to just mix it with a

---------36:04----------
little bit of the mTEC some nc5 5/9 heat

---------36:14----------
it up

---------36:17----------
and I'm gonna put it back through the

---------36:18----------
old ultrasonic and all of this will come

---------36:20----------
right off this will be really nice and

---------36:22----------
clean

---------36:27----------
the antics actually going to like

---------36:29----------
dissolve away the hard flux from the to

---------36:36----------
wick

---------36:37----------
[Applause]

---------37:04----------
this is a common problem to happen is

---------37:08----------
that when you rebuild these pads the

---------37:11----------
balls the chip combined and short things

---------37:14----------
out so we need to just surround

---------37:17----------
everything with conformal coating so

---------37:19----------
they can't do that you see one of my one

---------37:24----------
of my things moved I have to move that

---------37:27----------
back

---------37:34----------
[Applause]

---------38:04----------
yes

---------38:08----------
yes yes

---------38:11----------
[Music]

---------38:15----------
I already explained why in this video

---------38:17----------
you need to watch the video you have to

---------38:22----------
coil the wire into a circle or you wind

---------38:24----------
up shorting things

---------38:32----------
it's never going to slip into the wrong

---------38:34----------
patter hole

---------38:38----------
never he says never never

---------38:45----------
I'm sure this is flat

---------39:07----------
okay

---------39:10----------
I know you can't see it on the screen it

---------39:13----------
comes out better in the microscope with

---------39:15----------
your eyes because it's because it's a 3d

---------39:19----------
view but right here is like a little

---------39:22----------
gully between these two we want to build

---------39:24----------
that up so it's a little wall between

---------39:26----------
everything

---------41:23----------
dangerous has God bless your heart

---------41:27----------
Pedro was the operator is Elmo at Mac

---------41:29----------
support still God knows all moan Oh

---------41:36----------
Psalm Oh

---------41:44----------
no zamo

---------42:13----------
battery

---------42:20----------
and also does a version that stop the

---------42:22----------
time controller where they wired it up

---------42:23----------
so we're working

---------42:29----------
with watch LCD you've got to get theirs

---------43:57----------
alright then that looks much better

---------44:02----------
so now it's a little mountain between

---------44:04----------
the two let's try this again

---------44:14----------
[Applause]

---------44:21----------
[Applause]

---------44:31----------
you keep changing white balance

---------44:44----------
that's the right amount of flux that is

---------44:47----------
the right amount of flux that is the

---------44:54----------
right amount of flux

---------45:02----------
more flux

---------45:19----------
yeah definitely

---------45:36----------
look at that nice pool of flux right

---------45:39----------
underneath that chip nice happy polar

---------45:42----------
flux

---------45:51----------
