---------00:00----------
hello so today we're going to be looking

---------00:01----------
at an 8 to 0 2530 board that does not

---------00:04----------
turn on and yet no green light on the

---------00:07----------
charger I'm going to have to keep this

---------00:09----------
quick because as I said my lead

---------00:11----------
technician is still out on surgical

---------00:13----------
leave which means I have to do his job

---------00:14----------
plus mine and I'm also taking this class

---------00:17----------
on the weekends which means that I had

---------00:21----------
no free time I have no rest times as you

---------00:24----------
can see I plug it in is no green light

---------00:27----------
and I'm just going to go through the

---------00:28----------
troubleshooting process with you here a

---------00:31----------
little quickly because again no free

---------00:33----------
time so not going to go through opening

---------00:37----------
up the schematics I've done this a

---------00:38----------
million times already if you want to see

---------00:40----------
troubleshooting from beginning to end

---------00:41----------
you're welcome to view videos that I've

---------00:44----------
done in the past or I use the schematics

---------00:46----------
and I show you what I'm doing so I have

---------00:49----------
pp bus g3 hot which is a twelve point

---------00:51----------
six volt rail let's see if we have the 5

---------00:55----------
and the 3 volt rails here

---------01:00----------
you

---------01:07----------
you

---------01:13----------
you

---------01:16----------
you

---------01:19----------
so all right

---------01:21----------
three volt or

---------01:26----------
but no green light now I've talked about

---------01:28----------
the one wire circa 50 million times so I

---------01:30----------
am NOT going to get into how that works

---------01:32----------
I'm not going to explain how it works or

---------01:34----------
how it keeps the machine from turning on

---------01:36----------
what I will do very very quickly is show

---------01:39----------
you what it is that's 99 percent

---------01:41----------
likelihood wrong with this motherboard

---------01:43----------
let me just open up the screen capture

---------01:45----------
software so that I can show you exactly

---------01:46----------
what that is here so what I'm going to

---------01:49----------
be showing you here as soon as I open up

---------01:51----------
this is a chip that is very often the

---------01:55----------
problem or not a chip but a power line

---------01:57----------
to a chip that goes bad very often in

---------01:59----------
the cases of liquid damage now I'm not

---------02:01----------
going to explain everything here because

---------02:03----------
I have videos on the one wire circuit

---------02:05----------
you can freely search for the one wire

---------02:06----------
circuit and you'll see where I've

---------02:08----------
discussed it in these videos you it

---------02:09----------
doesn't need to be discussed 50 million

---------02:11----------
times as if it's from scratch every

---------02:13----------
single time I decide to go ahead and do

---------02:16----------
a video but her eyelids so we shrink me

---------02:20----------
because who the hell wants to see me

---------02:22----------
when you can see the beautiful

---------02:23----------
schematics okay so long story short once

---------02:27----------
my PDF reader decides to read something

---------02:30----------
we go long story short so the adapt this

---------02:33----------
is the DCN board right mag saved DC

---------02:35----------
power jack adapter sense talks to this

---------02:38----------
chip this then allows the adapter to

---------02:41----------
communicate with the SMC via the system

---------02:43----------
animator controller via this one wire

---------02:45----------
line this chip see the VCC tap VCC or

---------02:49----------
VDD anything like that that is the power

---------02:51----------
that the chip is using so that's the

---------02:53----------
power that the chip is using to actually

---------02:54----------
turn on so that you can you know so you

---------02:56----------
can so can work so when you see VCC or

---------02:58----------
VDD that's going to be the main power

---------03:00----------
line for a chip that is powering it and

---------03:02----------
allowing it to turn on so this is

---------03:04----------
turning on off of what comes from here

---------03:06----------
this over here is a logic gate this is

---------03:08----------
not going to turn on and send PP 3 V 4 2

---------03:11----------
G 3 hot through here if SM CBC a [ __ ] is

---------03:14----------
not here now

---------03:15----------
what happens all the time is that this

---------03:17----------
is a very very small very very small vo

---------03:21----------
right by the edge of the board it always

---------03:23----------
always dies so I will show you that here

---------03:26----------
and when I say always dies because it's

---------03:28----------
close to the it's close to is this thing

---------03:33----------
this is in Reverse isn't orange you're

---------03:36----------
upside down

---------03:37----------
come on mofo come on there we go

---------03:41----------
alright so what I mean is since it's

---------03:43----------
close to the edge of the board that's

---------03:44----------
where the water damage occurs and that's

---------03:46----------
where the problems arise so I showed you

---------03:50----------
that I have PP 3 V 4 to underscore g3

---------03:53----------
hot right but over here where I'm

---------03:55----------
supposed to so this over here is pin 5

---------03:58----------
of you 6901 so let's just switch back

---------04:01----------
real quick so you 6901 over here where

---------04:06----------
come on PDF reader this PDF reader is

---------04:09----------
not acting like it as to SSDs and raid 0

---------04:11----------
all right so this over here p b3 b4 to

---------04:13----------
underscore g3 hot is supposed to be on

---------04:15----------
pin 5 so watch what happens if I try to

---------04:18----------
measure for pin 5 let's see what I get

---------04:21----------
so if I try to measure that I'm probably

---------04:24----------
going to get something like 0 even

---------04:26----------
though my PB 3 V 4 to underscore g3

---------04:27----------
haunt our supply is just fine so when I

---------04:30----------
measure over there I get zero instead of

---------04:33----------
3.42 volts so I have to do now is I have

---------04:36----------
to find where I can get 3.42 volts on

---------04:39----------
this board and then steel 3.42 volts so

---------04:43----------
I can send it over to that leg of the

---------04:45----------
chip and that's going to be the fun part

---------04:48----------
so right next to it I have a leg from

---------04:50----------
this other chip which is

---------04:54----------
let's see what I get here

---------04:58----------
multi-meter because I faced it towards

---------05:00----------
you ad to put the camera up so I can see

---------05:03----------
that

---------05:07----------
I have nothing there because I actually

---------05:08----------
unplugged the board from the charger

---------05:10----------
this is what happens when you rush

---------05:13----------
because you have a bunch of stuff to do

---------05:15----------
and somebody is out sick so any I'll

---------05:17----------
just measure this here again just for

---------05:19----------
the hell of it because I okay so it's

---------05:20----------
zero point zero nine volts needless to

---------05:22----------
say that ain't what we need so if I go

---------05:24----------
over next door I can steal PP 3 V 4 -

---------05:28----------
from this which is cool yeah so that is

---------05:32----------
three point P P 3 P 3 on there and P P 3

---------05:35----------
V 4 - so I'm going to do is I'm going to

---------05:37----------
run a little wire from one to the other

---------05:39----------
and that is why Apple calls this the 1

---------05:43----------
wire circuit because when it [ __ ] up

---------05:45----------
you can always fix it using just one

---------05:47----------
wire so now I taught somebody had to do

---------05:51----------
border pair from scratch from not ever

---------05:54----------
having done it and he is much better

---------05:57----------
than I am at doing a better trick so

---------06:01----------
what he does I'll show you into the

---------06:02----------
microscope let me just turn the light a

---------06:04----------
little down so that you can see so let

---------06:08----------
me show you what he usually does which I

---------06:10----------
always fail at so this is where the 3

---------06:12----------
point 42 volts is supposed to come in

---------06:14----------
right it comes in through here and this

---------06:15----------
actually goes through the board right

---------06:17----------
there so what he will do is he will

---------06:18----------
simply grab it from the other side by

---------06:20----------
making a hole in the board so that hole

---------06:23----------
will go yeah like right over here

---------06:29----------
so he will simply make a hole on the

---------06:31----------
board and have that hole go all the way

---------06:33----------
through the board you can see where I I

---------06:35----------
tried to make a hole so that I could put

---------06:37----------
a wire through there and I failed

---------06:39----------
miserably so and he's always able to do

---------06:42----------
that he's much better at much better at

---------06:43----------
the arts and crafts kind of [ __ ] than I

---------06:44----------
am I suck at it so since I suck at it

---------06:47----------
what I'm going to do is I'm going to be

---------06:48----------
running a wire from here to here again

---------06:54----------
the right thing to do would just be to

---------06:56----------
make the hole and recreate the the blown

---------06:59----------
via that would be the right thing to do

---------07:01----------
but since I suck at that and you all can

---------07:04----------
laugh and make fun and say I can't

---------07:06----------
believe you're teaching the class on

---------07:07----------
these Emily you want to teach mother bow

---------07:09----------
to bear when you can't even fix a beer

---------07:11----------
oh yeah so that's what you're thinking

---------07:14----------
you you can all go [ __ ] yourself so this

---------07:16----------
over here I'm going to take a wire and

---------07:18----------
run it from there to there and this is

---------07:21----------
all probably going to work happily ever

---------07:23----------
after so let's turn on my soldering iron

---------07:24----------
and let's put the proper tip to do this

---------07:26----------
on my soldering iron and yeah shut the

---------07:31----------
[ __ ] up I have this hack o FX minus mu

---------07:36----------
change the tip whoever it hack o decided

---------07:38----------
to make it make that a loud annoying

---------07:40----------
beep when you change tips like I really

---------07:42----------
I would I would love to meet that person

---------07:44----------
I would love to I would love to give

---------07:48----------
them a piece of my mind

---------07:48----------
but so we're gonna put a little bit of

---------07:50----------
flux over here a little bit of flux over

---------07:53----------
here okay we're going to take my air

---------07:58----------
filter and put it over here because as

---------08:00----------
I've said many times I don't want to get

---------08:02----------
cancer subsided

---------08:19----------
all righty hit it nice and get this here

---------08:26----------
nice and juiced up

---------08:39----------
you

---------08:49----------
all righty now we get the cutters and

---------08:57----------
little piece of wire

---------09:05----------
your little piece of wire where'd you go

---------09:15----------
you

---------09:18----------
you

---------09:20----------
you

---------09:29----------
then the tweezers that I just put down

---------09:31----------
here we go wire that I

---------09:42----------
two short getting like a bigger wah-wah

---------09:44----------
they grow on

---------09:50----------
you can always make a long wire shorter

---------09:54----------
but you can't make a shorter wire longer

---------09:56----------
which is why it's good to just cut a

---------09:58----------
bigger piece and then shorten it to the

---------10:00----------
length that you would like it to be just

---------10:04----------
by twisting it that's what I like to do

---------10:06----------
I never put the nasty liquid in there

---------10:15----------
venire the ultrasonic cleaning stuff no

---------10:18----------
I forgot

---------10:19----------
that's just plain water right now I'm

---------10:21----------
sorry I hate this part of the job this

---------10:41----------
is the worst running jumpers is the

---------10:43----------
worst this is maddening

---------10:57----------
I'm not pulling on this directly I'm

---------10:59----------
moving it back and forth I'm not pulling

---------11:01----------
on the joint but right in front of the

---------11:02----------
joint you're going to see where it's

---------11:03----------
really becoming unstable because I'm

---------11:05----------
pulling it back and forth back and forth

---------11:07----------
back and forth and eventually it's going

---------11:10----------
to cut itself to the perfect length so

---------11:13----------
that is my 100% professional method form

---------11:18----------
for shortening my wire and there we go

---------11:23----------
obviously I have to coat that I'm not

---------11:26----------
going to leave that wire exposed that

---------11:27----------
would be that would that would seriously

---------11:29----------
be unprofessional so that I'm not going

---------11:31----------
to do what I'm going to do is I'm going

---------11:33----------
to plug it in to show you that the green

---------11:34----------
light works

---------11:59----------
fan spins yep so this is a common

---------12:04----------
problem with these boards with the older

---------12:06----------
2009-2010 ones because they have that

---------12:08----------
they have that one wire circuitry right

---------12:11----------
on the edge there and the other thing to

---------12:13----------
think about here is on the newer boards

---------12:15----------
that's not on the edge the one wire

---------12:16----------
circuit is not on that specific edge but

---------12:19----------
what is is current sensing circuitry and

---------12:21----------
also voltage sense circuitry for the

---------12:23----------
machine so if you have liquid in that

---------12:25----------
area on the newer machines it's going to

---------12:26----------
be very common is that it's running very

---------12:28----------
slow and then it's you know just when

---------12:30----------
it's running off of the battery it's

---------12:31----------
unbearably slow so that is an area to

---------12:34----------
check that's a common issue on the eight

---------12:36----------
to zero twenty five thirty eight to zero

---------12:38----------
2879 board which honestly is so old at

---------12:41----------
this point that they kind of belong in

---------12:44----------
the trash can I mean this this is Core 2

---------12:47----------
Duo I mean you know this has a video

---------12:49----------
chip on it that gets boiling hot and the

---------12:52----------
very nice cool CPU in the two-year-old

---------12:54----------
laptop that I have has a better video on

---------12:58----------
it than this boiling discrete video chip

---------13:01----------
just because it's so old but it was

---------13:03----------
decent when it came out but now like

---------13:05----------
this this kind of really belongs you

---------13:08----------
know but somebody wanted to fix it

---------13:10----------
and somebody wanted to pay so I'll fix

---------13:13----------
it so that's a common one wire circuit

---------13:15----------
issue it's called the one wire circuit

---------13:17----------
by Apple because you can always fix it

---------13:19----------
by just using one wire and that's that
