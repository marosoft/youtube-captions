---------00:00----------
until I know the scope of what's going

---------00:02----------
on the details and until I just hear

---------00:05----------
back from my attorney with everything

---------00:06----------
that I'm with all of my questions

---------00:07----------
answered the way that I'd like them to

---------00:10----------
be answered I'm going to change a little

---------00:12----------
bit of the way that I do the videos so

---------00:13----------
do forgive me if you find the format to

---------00:15----------
be not as appealing as the old ones so

---------00:17----------
let's see if we can tell what's going on

---------00:18----------
with this MacBook Air board over here

---------00:22----------
remember no spill no spill never spill

---------00:27----------
okay we have this crap over here oh no

---------00:37----------
spill right all right if that and then

---------00:42----------
Oh God and we have this that's on a TPS

---------00:46----------
five one nine one six okay so the first

---------00:49----------
thing that I would want to do here is I

---------00:50----------
would want to open the schematic and the

---------00:52----------
schematic I'd like to see how that works

---------00:55----------
so let's just open up a schematic over

---------00:58----------
here so I can show you what's going on

---------01:00----------
okay so it seems like that chip is you

---------01:03----------
7400 it's 1.2 volts for the RAM and it's

---------01:08----------
important and I don't like water sad

---------01:13----------
brownie face what what do you guys want

---------01:19----------
from me I can't I'm not a visual artist

---------01:21----------
I can't draw this is the this this is

---------01:24----------
what you're going to have to put up with

---------01:25----------
until I'm fully informed and up-to-date

---------01:28----------
on what and on what the lovely people at

---------01:33----------
Kilpatrick and Townsend have in store

---------01:34----------
for me now anyway so let's let's

---------01:38----------
continue oh I tried man I tried I tried

---------01:45----------
but you you all you want me to just give

---------01:47----------
up no I know exactly so what I would do

---------01:50----------
here so one thing you may notice is that

---------01:53----------
the chip says ti on it which indicates

---------01:55----------
that it's probably made by Texas

---------01:56----------
Instruments and then it says 501 six now

---------01:59----------
with this indicate now most of the Texas

---------02:01----------
Instruments chipsets that you're going

---------02:03----------
to find they start with TPS so what I

---------02:05----------
would do here is I would google TPS 509

---------02:08----------
one six and see what I find and

---------02:10----------
hopefully I find a schematic that's

---------02:12----------
better than the last one

---------02:13----------
that schematic was sad nine to five five

---------02:18----------
one nine to five no it was a different

---------02:20----------
number five one nine one six dad a sheet

---------02:23----------
and we're gonna just I want to get an

---------02:24----------
idea of how this is put together so

---------02:28----------
let's see here we go so this is what I'm

---------02:30----------
interested in all right so this looks

---------02:31----------
like a buck regulator with an L do so

---------02:37----------
the whole idea here is a buck regulator

---------02:39----------
is something that's going to take a

---------02:40----------
higher power and to a higher voltage and

---------02:42----------
turn into a lower voltage and an L do is

---------02:44----------
something that's gonna take a low

---------02:46----------
voltage and turn it into a slightly

---------02:48----------
lower voltage so for example like you

---------02:49----------
might turn if you want to turn 12 volts

---------02:52----------
in a one buck converter if you want to

---------02:55----------
turn like three volts in a one and a

---------02:57----------
half L do if that makes any sense I've

---------03:00----------
really oversimplified something that

---------03:02----------
deserves much more explanation but just

---------03:04----------
to get to the point there so let's go

---------03:06----------
back to our screen over here now the

---------03:08----------
main thing that I'm interested in when

---------03:09----------
it comes to this type of circuit is the

---------03:11----------
input output what I'm expecting so it

---------03:13----------
says over here V in V in on pin 12 which

---------03:17----------
is going to be 5 volts so 5 V in let me

---------03:21----------
just zoom in in case you can't really

---------03:22----------
see that too well 5 volts in on pin 12

---------03:26----------
and I should get well according to the

---------03:31----------
schematic over here the schematic says

---------03:33----------
that it's 1.2 v volts for ram so I'm

---------03:36----------
expecting 1.2 volts on output so on pin

---------03:39----------
12 I should see input and on pin 2 I

---------03:45----------
should see output and I get C because

---------03:49----------
this is output and it's going back to

---------03:50----------
pin 2 and so that I can see what it's

---------03:52----------
making whatever so let's go back over

---------03:54----------
here and and take a look at this area so

---------03:57----------
I'm gonna since we have a dot over here

---------03:59----------
I can may jump to the assumption that

---------04:01----------
this is over here is going to be pin 2

---------04:03----------
which is where the output do this should

---------04:06----------
be and then over here somewhere up here

---------04:11----------
should be pin 12 which is where input

---------04:13----------
would be the problem is that looks so

---------04:14----------
bad I can't even really see anything if

---------04:16----------
it looks that bad it probably shouldn't

---------04:18----------
be on the board itself so I'm just going

---------04:20----------
to take all that crap all right kicking

---------04:22----------
on the air filter

---------04:31----------
find me a donor here we go donor board

---------04:38----------
no not the same grab me

---------05:20----------
yeah I mean there are some things that I

---------05:21----------
genuinely want to share but I just don't

---------05:24----------
want to say anything until I know where

---------05:27----------
I stand but I know that I'm getting

---------05:29----------
trolled there are just certain things

---------05:31----------
that you just don't expect to hear from

---------05:32----------
certain people and I know that in some

---------05:36----------
way shape or form that I am being

---------05:38----------
trolled and that it's going to come back

---------05:40----------
to bite me in the ass in some way that I

---------05:42----------
don't expect I'm really excited for the

---------05:48----------
day where I can freely speak about all

---------05:50----------
of this as if it was past tense

---------06:28----------
gross so we're gonna clean this area a

---------06:32----------
little bit so it's fit for rework

---------06:55----------
there was a hair in there

---------07:03----------
okay scratch away at this

---------07:11----------
so fetch

---------07:26----------
you think the one thing that kind of

---------07:27----------
gets me about all of this when I read

---------07:29----------
particular posts from people who are

---------07:31----------
really a fan of Apple one thing I don't

---------07:33----------
think people understand at the end of

---------07:36----------
the day for all the things I may say

---------07:37----------
about Apple support Apple out of

---------07:40----------
warranty service how Apple treats

---------07:42----------
independent repair centers what I do is

---------07:45----------
keep stuff working for people that use

---------07:47----------
and love Apple products like really I

---------07:52----------
mean for all the stuff that I say my job

---------07:54----------
is pretty much to keep things working

---------07:56----------
for other for people who like Apple

---------07:57----------
products so I mean even if you don't

---------08:02----------
like let's say you know I say something

---------08:03----------
about the iPhone or the MacBook that you

---------08:06----------
may not like because that's one of the

---------08:08----------
things that I talk about is I say um you

---------08:09----------
know there are certain things that are

---------08:10----------
subjective for example like operating

---------08:13----------
system usage or features but then there

---------08:15----------
are things that are objective such as

---------08:18----------
you know what I deal with when I work on

---------08:21----------
the product or objective matters like

---------08:25----------
spill resistance touch I see issues on

---------08:29----------
the iPhone 6 you know when you dear

---------08:31----------
that's a great one I mean when you walk

---------08:33----------
into the store the employee is literally

---------08:34----------
look he takes your phone from you and

---------08:36----------
you have a touch I see issue on an

---------08:37----------
iPhone 6 he tells you we do not

---------08:39----------
acknowledge the problem and while he's

---------08:41----------
saying we don't acknowledge the problem

---------08:43----------
he's saying that out loud to you while

---------08:45----------
he's bending your phone to try to get

---------08:47----------
the touch I see you back working you

---------08:50----------
know that kind of stuff is a objective

---------08:52----------
so you may think Lois you're crapping I

---------08:54----------
want you to think about this because a

---------08:56----------
lot of people say that it's a jump to

---------08:57----------
the negative this they say you know

---------08:59----------
you're too negative well but when I'm

---------09:01----------
being negative towards a negative

---------09:02----------
situation that that actually is a

---------09:04----------
positive so if the company that you love

---------09:07----------
is making a product that in some way you

---------09:12----------
know is designed in a manner in which it

---------09:14----------
usually lasts 12 months and then a lot

---------09:17----------
of them die and I say hey that probably

---------09:20----------
shouldn't happen and if it does happen

---------09:22----------
there should be support available for it

---------09:24----------
I don't think that's a negative thing

---------09:27----------
I'm saying a negative thing about

---------09:28----------
something that just so happens to be

---------09:30----------
negative in the hopes that it will be

---------09:33----------
remedied and become positive

---------09:38----------
and a lot of it that's the thing I don't

---------09:40----------
use these products but if I were do ever

---------09:43----------
always said if David Bowie were coming

---------09:46----------
back to life

---------09:46----------
for 40 minutes only and I got to record

---------09:50----------
him doing you've been around live before

---------09:52----------
he goes back into his grave I would not

---------09:55----------
do that on my the machine that I use

---------09:57----------
here I'd get a Mac for it you know there

---------09:59----------
are uses for everything and a lot of the

---------10:01----------
people who use these mission-critical

---------10:02----------
products one of the things that would be

---------10:05----------
a good selling point to the individuals

---------10:06----------
that use these mission-critical products

---------10:08----------
is support not just first party support

---------10:11----------
but third party as well knowing that

---------10:15----------
when you're out of warranty or when

---------10:16----------
you're away from an Apple store that you

---------10:18----------
can go someplace and they will make it

---------10:19----------
work again that's valuable to the

---------10:22----------
professional community and it's

---------10:28----------
something that we would offer

---------10:33----------
[Music]

---------10:42----------
yeah it's one of those things were sick

---------10:44----------
I get done with a really long drawn-out

---------10:46----------
legal battle of crap now win and I'm

---------10:50----------
good I even made time I cleaned up my

---------10:53----------
whole apartment I got wire ties for all

---------10:55----------
the behind my TV and my stereo it's

---------10:58----------
like I got free time man

---------11:00----------
great yeah I got a call from frigging

---------11:04----------
billion-dollar law firm will it ever end

---------11:13----------
okay

---------11:35----------
I wonder how many people are going to

---------11:37----------
unsubscribe when they see the schematic

---------11:38----------
that I made

---------11:49----------
if you want to call that a

---------11:51----------
schematic a schematic

---------12:01----------
[Music]

---------12:38----------
I'm gonna turn that vent around so it's

---------12:39----------
not pointing at you anymore

---------12:41----------
but I'm done cuz I'm sure that that's

---------12:42----------
freezing it's literally blowing directly

---------12:46----------
on you cuz I love cold now we go over to

---------12:52----------
this area so what is that resistor for

---------12:58----------
the one that looks really nasty the one

---------13:01----------
right to see what I'm talking about when

---------13:02----------
I say the one that looks really nasty I

---------13:04----------
should have said that before I put flux

---------13:05----------
on but I showed you before was that one

---------13:07----------
see that with the nasty stuff let's see

---------13:10----------
what that was all right so it looks like

---------13:13----------
that is a resistor so it's a 35.7

---------13:19----------
kiloohm resistor between P P 1 vo 5 s o

---------13:23----------
v RF and P P 1 vo 5s o FB so let's see

---------13:26----------
it do we have 35 kilo ohms there check

---------13:29----------
on the multimeter

---------13:41----------
surprisingly we do but I still don't

---------13:43----------
trust it I just have a feeling that

---------13:45----------
that's gonna break later on so I'm still

---------13:47----------
gonna relate if it looks like that my

---------13:54----------
trust is low

---------14:08----------
okay we take this off BAM and

---------14:19----------
oh the iron was sleeping there for a

---------14:22----------
second

---------14:26----------
all right whoops you get this going

---------14:36----------
focus

---------14:43----------
bumping into this microscope camera more

---------14:45----------
and more often lady

---------14:56----------
flow on a place good little resist a

---------15:00----------
good boy good resistor all right now

---------15:07----------
time to see if we have magic

---------15:13----------
BAM baby haha that's and this is one of

---------15:20----------
the boys that turns on/off on/off on/off

---------15:21----------
then finally on but as you can see it

---------15:24----------
works yay beautiful and that's how we

---------15:29----------
fix boards in the new system until I

---------15:33----------
hear back from my attorney these are the

---------15:36----------
schematics that you guys will be dealing

---------15:38----------
with because I can't draw and

---------15:42----------
that's it for today
