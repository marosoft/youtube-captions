the stream is brought to you by Paul

---------00:01----------
Daniels is buggy software if you want to

---------00:03----------
feel just the way Superman felt when Dan

---------00:05----------
Turpin got killed by Darkseid you can

---------00:07----------
check out PL Daniel's comm slash flex

---------00:09----------
board view so we have a Macbook that we

---------00:12----------
could so here we have a MacBook

---------00:14----------
that's not turning on and a technician

---------00:16----------
that's boot looping let's see if we can

---------00:19----------
fix this MacBook and get Lewis to stop

---------00:20----------
boot looping and open this MacBook up

---------00:22----------
alright so what are the first things

---------00:23----------
that my eyes are drawn to here so the

---------00:25----------
first things that my eyes are drawn to

---------00:27----------
are this area over here it looks like

---------00:30----------
there was paper over a sticker or

---------00:31----------
something that's been removed it makes

---------00:34----------
me wonder if somebody's touched this

---------00:35----------
area and it looks like they have because

---------00:37----------
this comes off a little too easily so

---------00:39----------
this has been open before and the first

---------00:42----------
thing I'm gonna really be interested in

---------00:44----------
doing is unplugging the battery so that

---------00:46----------
I can tell how much amperage the board

---------00:47----------
takes so one of the ways that I

---------00:49----------
troubleshoot these boards is by fixing

---------00:52----------
it then writing down what the problem

---------00:54----------
was that I had and then writing down the

---------00:56----------
amperage that the board was taking when

---------00:58----------
it had that when I first started working

---------00:59----------
on it so this way I have a nice little

---------01:01----------
table so that when it's taking 50

---------01:03----------
milliamps it cuz probably one of these

---------01:04----------
problems when is taking 100 milliamps

---------01:06----------
that's probably one of these problems

---------01:07----------
and so on and so forth the problem is

---------01:09----------
that the battery the base depending on

---------01:12----------
how charged the battery is it's going to

---------01:13----------
draw a different amount of amperage from

---------01:14----------
the board charging circuit and that's

---------01:16----------
gonna mess up my readings so in order to

---------01:18----------
remove that from the mix I'm gonna

---------01:19----------
unplug the battery before I plug the

---------01:21----------
charger in that's very important so that

---------01:23----------
I get a reading of just what the board

---------01:25----------
is taking on its own without the

---------01:28----------
external variable of the battery which

---------01:31----------
could be a different amount of charge

---------01:32----------
from computer to computer so it looks

---------01:34----------
like this is at 5.20 2 volts zero point

---------01:38----------
zero zero amps and I don't know if it

---------01:41----------
just went to 19 right before it died or

---------01:43----------
not let me just watch that a little

---------01:44----------
closer yeah so it doesn't look like it

---------01:49----------
changes up to 20 volts before it dies it

---------01:52----------
just just immediately dies so I'm gonna

---------01:56----------
take the board out and try and figure

---------01:57----------
out why it is it's only going to 5 volts

---------02:01----------
and not 20 so let's get the board out of

---------02:03----------
the case before we can take a look at

---------02:05----------
this under the microscope we're going to

---------02:06----------
see if P P 3 P 3 under square G three

---------02:09----------
hottest present P P 3 B 3 underscore G 3

---------02:11----------
hot is going to be pow

---------02:13----------
these four chips that are going to be

---------02:15----------
speaking directly to the charger so

---------02:16----------
let's take a look at this so you 3100 as

---------02:18----------
a CD 32 15 this CD 32 15 is a USBC MUX

---------02:23----------
it's very similar to the CD 32 11 that

---------02:26----------
gets used on the 2013 and 14 MacBook

---------02:28----------
Airs as a thunderbolt bucks because

---------02:31----------
Thunderbolt is similar to USB see in

---------02:32----------
that regard and these chips are going to

---------02:35----------
have a direct line of communication with

---------02:36----------
the charger itself now remember USB see

---------02:40----------
chargers can put out different voltages

---------02:41----------
you can put out five volts nine volts

---------02:43----------
and it can put out 20 volts so that it

---------02:47----------
needs to have a negotiation with the

---------02:50----------
charger in order to say hi I am a

---------02:52----------
MacBook

---------02:53----------
I don't want five volts I'm a MacBook

---------02:55----------
MacBook I want full power now the chip

---------02:57----------
has to turn on in order to make that

---------02:59----------
happen

---------02:59----------
so in order for the chip to turn on and

---------03:01----------
needs to get its power rail so the same

---------03:03----------
way that my microscope camera is not

---------03:06----------
going to turn on if it doesn't have its

---------03:08----------
VCC or voltage into it as my CD 3215 USB

---------03:13----------
C much chip is not going to turn on if

---------03:14----------
it doesn't have voltage going into it

---------03:16----------
that it needs to turn on so up here

---------03:18----------
you'll see that typically on most

---------03:20----------
MacBook schematics that the power rails

---------03:23----------
that are going into a chip to turn it on

---------03:25----------
the power that's needed for it to work

---------03:27----------
is going to be on the top and up here we

---------03:29----------
have V in which I'm going to imagine

---------03:30----------
stands for voltage in 3.3 volts and that

---------03:33----------
is going to pp 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot

---------03:37----------
that rail needs to be present in order

---------03:39----------
for these chips to turn on if it's not

---------03:40----------
present the chip will not turn on and it

---------03:42----------
will not work so let's see if we have PP

---------03:44----------
3 B 3 underscore g3 hot we're gonna turn

---------03:46----------
on Paul Daniels as execrable multimeter

---------03:48----------
software and see if it works today and

---------03:51----------
get that on the screen now we're going

---------03:54----------
to find out where it is we can measure

---------03:55----------
pp 3 V 3 underscore g3 hot on this board

---------03:58----------
and it looks like that's going to be

---------03:59----------
present on a capacitor that's right next

---------04:01----------
to the chip which is fairly convenient

---------04:02----------
so we're gonna roll over our microscope

---------04:04----------
camera and take a look and see what we

---------04:07----------
get when we plug this in so we're going

---------04:11----------
to this and it looks like we do get 3.4

---------04:16----------
volts so three point four volts is

---------04:20----------
present on the on this cd32 15 so now

---------04:25----------
what we're going to do is we're going to

---------04:26----------
take a look at what

---------04:27----------
cd32 15 looks like so one thing that Tim

---------04:29----------
had said in his video on this is that

---------04:32----------
every CD 3215 needs to work if even one

---------04:35----------
of them does not function you will not

---------04:37----------
get anything to turn on so the way this

---------04:39----------
machine works is has four USB C ports if

---------04:41----------
any one of those USB seaports doesn't

---------04:44----------
work the entire machine will stop

---------04:46----------
working that's Apple design that is

---------04:48----------
beautiful beautiful Apple engineering

---------04:50----------
and design if you have a issue with one

---------04:52----------
port none of them will work Apple

---------04:55----------
[ __ ] design it's beautiful thank

---------04:59----------
different people wonder why I have a

---------05:01----------
broken chair there are so many reasons

---------05:02----------
to break something when working on Apple

---------05:04----------
products there's so many reasons to hit

---------05:06----------
something or throw something or break

---------05:08----------
something when working on Apple products

---------05:10----------
the deeper you go into the rabbit hole

---------05:12----------
of how these products are engineered and

---------05:14----------
designed the more you're going to want

---------05:15----------
to take things and some in Hulk smash

---------05:17----------
Hulk throw Hulk destroy its ah why do

---------05:22----------
you make [ __ ] like this why it's [ __ ]

---------05:26----------
awful let's take a look at each of our

---------05:27----------
cd32 15s so over here we have one CD

---------05:32----------
3215 this one looks fine this one looks

---------05:35----------
pretty I don't see any issue with this

---------05:37----------
this one also looks good it's difficult

---------05:40----------
to tell if that's simply pubes and dust

---------05:42----------
or actual signs of liquid damage aha and

---------05:45----------
here it comes out so I will leave you

---------05:48----------
all to tell me what it is you see over

---------05:50----------
here and what you think of what you see

---------05:52----------
let's see if you can spot what's going

---------05:53----------
on over here

---------05:54----------
[Music]

---------06:16----------
so what do you see over there Erica what

---------06:19----------
I see over here is you look a little

---------06:22----------
burned you look a little corroded and

---------06:26----------
you look a little corroded now here's

---------06:28----------
the thing I don't think that any of

---------06:30----------
these resistors are actually bad I think

---------06:33----------
that these resistors may be fine

---------06:36----------
what I think the actual issue is going

---------06:39----------
to wind up being is that the the path

---------06:44----------
under the resistor is going to be

---------06:46----------
corroded or that there's going to be

---------06:48----------
corrosion onto the chip that we cannot

---------06:49----------
see so even if somebody takes a scrub

---------06:52----------
brush or a q-tip and rubs all around

---------06:53----------
this area it's not actually going to

---------06:55----------
clean under the chip an ultrasonic

---------06:57----------
cleaner like the ones that we have out

---------06:58----------
of stock at stored out Rossman group

---------06:59----------
comm and Mikey the ultrasonics that are

---------07:03----------
out of stock on the store across from

---------07:05----------
group comm mmm hint would clean very

---------07:11----------
well underneath this chip so let's take

---------07:14----------
a look and see if the what these

---------07:17----------
resistors are rated for and what they

---------07:19----------
are actually so this resistor is for

---------07:23----------
Thunderbolts SPI there and you are

---------07:28----------
supposed to be 15 ohms we're gonna see

---------07:30----------
if that's actually 15 ohms 21 ohms close

---------07:36----------
enough the next resistor that's corroded

---------07:37----------
looking is this one down here even

---------07:40----------
though it's barely corroded that's for

---------07:41----------
display port aux channel so I don't I

---------07:44----------
don't give a crap about display port aux

---------07:45----------
channel why am I gonna care about this

---------07:48----------
this is for image we don't turn on this

---------07:51----------
doesn't charge it doesn't turn on so one

---------07:53----------
of the other things that's important

---------07:54----------
when going through the schematic to try

---------07:56----------
and figure out what is relevant so this

---------07:58----------
has an issue where it doesn't turn on I

---------08:00----------
don't care about display port because

---------08:02----------
display port is for image an image is

---------08:04----------
for machines that turn on the same way

---------08:05----------
that you're not going to think about

---------08:07----------
your twenty-fifth anniversary with

---------08:08----------
somebody who just went on a day you're

---------08:09----------
not gonna think about having kids before

---------08:11----------
you got married you're not gonna think

---------08:12----------
about marriage before you go out on the

---------08:13----------
first date don't jump the gun I'm not

---------08:15----------
gonna get excited about a display port

---------08:18----------
area being corroded when I don't even

---------08:20----------
have a machine that turns on so I'm not

---------08:21----------
even bothering to care about that at

---------08:23----------
this point now the other that's corroded

---------08:25----------
is this one up here let's see if this is

---------08:27----------
for something important also it has a

---------08:29----------
little bit of red by

---------08:30----------
that I thought was actually burned but

---------08:32----------
that is not a burn mark in the upper

---------08:34----------
left corner you'll notice that there is

---------08:35----------
actually a red pubic hair in there

---------08:37----------
because when I saw the red I thought

---------08:39----------
maybe that was something burned but no

---------08:41----------
it's purely a red pube so we're gonna

---------08:42----------
take a look on the schematic and see

---------08:44----------
what that resistor is for that looks

---------08:46----------
like an I squared C pulldown resistor to

---------08:49----------
ground I don't think that that actually

---------08:51----------
matters or that that is important RB 309

---------08:53----------
over here you're a good guy Mikey we

---------08:57----------
have a very good shipping person here

---------08:58----------
you may have noticed that ever since

---------09:00----------
around November December that if you

---------09:03----------
bought something from store that Rossman

---------09:04----------
group com you actually got what you

---------09:06----------
ordered rather than somebody just taking

---------09:08----------
any random thing out of the bin and

---------09:10----------
that's because mikey is the best

---------09:12----------
shipping clerk that we've ever had by

---------09:13----------
far the best he has never sent a laptop

---------09:17----------
to China when it was supposed to go to

---------09:18----------
Canada he has never gotten wasted in my

---------09:23----------
basement and fell asleep on

---------09:25----------
bubble-wrapped after getting drunk

---------09:29----------
he has never talked about how he wanted

---------09:32----------
to ask [ __ ] my customer service

---------09:33----------
representative who was female and not

---------09:35----------
attracted to him here he has never

---------09:40----------
missed work on Monday because of a

---------09:41----------
cocaine binge again I'm not setting the

---------09:44----------
standard very high here I'm just saying

---------09:46----------
that he is worlds ahead of every other

---------09:50----------
shipping clerk I've ever had he's a good

---------09:52----------
dude what I have going on here is

---------09:54----------
corrosion in this area that on several

---------09:57----------
different components but of these

---------09:59----------
different components that are corroded

---------10:00----------
what you'll notice is that none of them

---------10:02----------
are corroded to the point of it being a

---------10:05----------
deal breaker and when I say deal breaker

---------10:06----------
I mean where it's going to keep it from

---------10:08----------
turning on so what I most likely have is

---------10:10----------
generalized corrosion on to the chip the

---------10:13----------
fact that there is that the chip looks

---------10:15----------
burned but that there is no that the

---------10:19----------
resistors look burned but there's no

---------10:20----------
green tells me that somebody tried to

---------10:22----------
clean it but they did a poor job of it

---------10:23----------
which means they probably didn't clean

---------10:25----------
under the chip which means that under

---------10:26----------
the chip is going to be corrosion so I'm

---------10:28----------
guessing it's not going to even be a bad

---------10:29----------
chip but simply a bad soldering job on

---------10:31----------
on that chip as a result of corrosion

---------10:34----------
under it so I am going to remove the

---------10:36----------
charge port from that side of the board

---------10:37----------
before I do a reflow since I have a

---------10:39----------
tendency to melt the charge port off of

---------10:42----------
the board by being an idiot and this

---------10:44----------
sport also has corroded and should be

---------10:45----------
replaced anyway so we're going to take

---------10:47----------
this off of the board and then we are

---------10:49----------
going to reflow that and after reflow

---------10:52----------
it's probably gonna work and be

---------10:54----------
beautiful MA but the other thing Mikey

---------10:57----------
is that the with the crests being out of

---------10:59----------
stock is that they're probably not going

---------11:02----------
to want to sell me new ones until I pay

---------11:04----------
them for the old ones but we weren't

---------11:06----------
paying what we didn't pay crest for the

---------11:08----------
old cleaners because they took us months

---------11:10----------
to get back to us on the cleaners that

---------11:11----------
we had that didn't work it's it's a

---------11:15----------
tough relationship with that company

---------11:16----------
there's another company that I forget

---------11:17----------
the name of there and it's on the tip of

---------11:18----------
my tongue that I really wanted to sell

---------11:20----------
cleaners off but they don't fit anything

---------11:22----------
for the new MacBooks and the only stuff

---------11:24----------
that fits for the new MacBooks the only

---------11:25----------
cleaners that will actually fit this

---------11:27----------
board by this other company I was

---------11:29----------
looking at cost about three to five

---------11:30----------
thousand dollars and crest cells that

---------11:33----------
the P 1200 is perfect for touch bar

---------11:35----------
MacBooks it's genuinely amazing they the

---------11:37----------
only issue with the cleaner is that it's

---------11:39----------
sold by crest and crest makes amazing

---------11:41----------
cleaner and hopf notch cleaners but my

---------11:44----------
god doing business with them is a

---------11:45----------
nightmare

---------11:46----------
I love them I love I genuinely love

---------11:48----------
their product the only way I'm gonna get

---------11:49----------
them to actually answer my email when it

---------11:51----------
comes to an RMA because they don't

---------11:53----------
answer any emails they don't answer

---------11:54----------
voicemails or phone calls the only way

---------11:56----------
for them to care about me asking for an

---------11:59----------
RMA is to not pay them and then once

---------12:02----------
they email me saying we have hey we

---------12:04----------
notice you you owe its $14,000 it's for

---------12:07----------
me to respond to that email sewing oh

---------12:08----------
yes I probably do owe you that money but

---------12:11----------
while I'm here would you like to take

---------12:13----------
back these cleaners I got that don't

---------12:15----------
work that it's a bit of a New York way

---------12:17----------
of doing business but if someone doesn't

---------12:19----------
get back to you or respond to you and

---------12:20----------
you need them to respond to you what you

---------12:22----------
do is you typically withhold their money

---------12:24----------
and at some point the problem will solve

---------12:26----------
itself either a you've got fourteen

---------12:29----------
thousand dollars of free stuff or B they

---------12:31----------
actually email you about the money that

---------12:33----------
you haven't paid them and then you've

---------12:34----------
used that point to say oh yeah I'll pay

---------12:36----------
you for that by the way well I've got

---------12:38----------
you on the phone can you take back the

---------12:41----------
stuff that doesn't work give me a

---------12:43----------
warranty for it's a New York way of

---------12:46----------
doing business

---------12:47----------
it works the problem is that by the time

---------12:49----------
they actually got back to us on the

---------12:50----------
warranty form we were very behind on

---------12:52----------
everything so then it took us a while to

---------12:54----------
send them back

---------12:57----------
then by that point we were the ones that

---------12:59----------
were being slow but that's the thing do

---------13:01----------
it stuff like that it really strains the

---------13:03----------
relationship between the company and the

---------13:06----------
vendor and the customer it really does

---------13:08----------
strain it when like one of them doesn't

---------13:10----------
doesn't email you back when you ask

---------13:12----------
about returns and then the other person

---------13:14----------
with holds payments it's very straight

---------13:16----------
strenuous on the relationship especially

---------13:18----------
if you want to continue doing business

---------13:19----------
with them because they make a really

---------13:21----------
nice product I think that they make

---------13:22----------
excellent ultrasonics

---------13:23----------
I think they clean better than Branson

---------13:25----------
ones that as and the Branson ones will

---------13:28----------
cost more money I did some I did some

---------13:31----------
videos on that a few years ago and I

---------13:33----------
believe I earned the right to do that

---------13:35----------
video because I am the idiot that spent

---------13:36----------
over $1,000 on a Branson cleaner that

---------13:39----------
couldn't clean jack-shit

---------13:40----------
so I earned the right to review that by

---------13:44----------
wasting my own money on it now if I

---------13:46----------
found a company that had cleaners that

---------13:47----------
were the quality of crest in terms but

---------13:49----------
also had somebody other than half of a

---------13:53----------
Kevin answering their emails that point

---------13:55----------
that I would be very very excited though

---------13:58----------
alright so we're gonna do a gentle

---------13:59----------
reflow here I've got my twelve

---------14:00----------
millimeter nozzle which is not for sale

---------14:03----------
on store dot Ross Maghrib calm because

---------14:04----------
quick has not had them in stock for the

---------14:07----------
last six months makes me very glad that

---------14:09----------
I got these nozzles while I could so we

---------14:17----------
are going to reflow these chips and one

---------14:20----------
thing that you may notice here is that I

---------14:22----------
am reflowing

---------14:23----------
to chips at the same time 80gb uses

---------14:25----------
every man's dream right here to chips at

---------14:28----------
the same time because when you've got a

---------14:35----------
nozzle that's big enough you two can do

---------14:38----------
two chips at the same time oh that was

---------14:42----------
awful okay not only did I miss the

---------14:47----------
reflow not only did I not have it on

---------14:48----------
camera but oh my god that is dumb

---------14:54----------
oh I wrecked it okay that was that was

---------15:00----------
awful

---------15:01----------
that chip is sitting sideways

---------15:04----------
[Music]

---------15:31----------
you never want to stay and whatever it

---------15:34----------
is you're doing long enough to become a

---------15:35----------
joke this is a resistor book comes in

---------15:41----------
pretty handy as you can see from the

---------15:48----------
sizes of the resistor things that this

---------15:52----------
is not the first time that I've done

---------15:54----------
this you can see this is not the first

---------15:57----------
time that I've done this oh man

---------16:02----------
these tweezers are so sodomized these

---------16:07----------
are not trees anymore okay so remember

---------16:09----------
one of the things that you should do

---------16:10----------
when you're working is turn the board so

---------16:13----------
that you're comfortable not the board

---------16:15----------
most people appear to focus on the

---------16:16----------
board's comfort or how the board sits on

---------16:18----------
the desk as if an apple product as if

---------16:21----------
this thing deserves comfort throughout

---------16:23----------
its life it does not what you'd so I'm

---------16:26----------
gonna turn the board so that it is

---------16:27----------
easier to work on by my standards slide

---------16:32----------
over here these resistors are more

---------16:35----------
crooked than Google's Terms of Service

---------16:36----------
and Privacy Policy all of this even

---------16:39----------
though those are ridiculously crooked

---------16:40----------
it's actually fine it's okay that these

---------16:41----------
are crooked because this board is

---------16:44----------
running for office

---------16:45----------
no I'm kidding it the reason it's okay

---------16:46----------
that it's crooked is because as long as

---------16:48----------
there's flux on there when I actually

---------16:50----------
heat the BGA chip to have that sit into

---------16:52----------
place once I'm heating the BGA chip that

---------16:55----------
resistors are all gonna kind of settle

---------16:57----------
into place as long as this flux there so

---------16:59----------
that the solder doesn't become all mushy

---------17:01----------
and nasty so now I just got to replace

---------17:02----------
that capacitor and then I knocked off

---------17:06----------
and then this board will be set these

---------17:11----------
poor little hot razors they lasted at

---------17:12----------
this desk like two weeks before this

---------17:14----------
happened to them I wasn't scraping with

---------17:18----------
them either I was a I was a good boy

---------17:21----------
that happened because I dropped them on

---------17:22----------
the floor

---------17:28----------
okay [ __ ] it I'll just let them flow in

---------17:30----------
a place with hot air I clearly can't get

---------17:33----------
them to go into place with the tweezers

---------17:35----------
because I suck hey hello

---------17:40----------
delivery oh is it for Louis my name is

---------17:45----------
Louis yes Louis Louie let's see what

---------17:49----------
does it say huh if somebody else ordered

---------17:53----------
it there's nobody in this building

---------17:55----------
because it went on fire so this I'm the

---------17:57----------
only person here so what what address

---------17:59----------
does that say it's two yeah so there's

---------18:03----------
nobody in this building besides me so

---------18:05----------
that means somebody probably ordered

---------18:06----------
that for me my name is Louis but

---------18:10----------
somebody else I must have ordered that

---------18:12----------
for me I have no idea I'm doing a

---------18:16----------
livestream on YouTube and people order

---------18:18----------
me things every now and then either way

---------18:21----------
you can knock on the door there's nobody

---------18:22----------
in this building but me because it went

---------18:23----------
on fire see how it says over here

---------18:25----------
conditions are immediately perilous to

---------18:27----------
life that doesn't apply to me though cuz

---------18:30----------
I fix MacBooks anyway okay so yeah what

---------18:41----------
I was I talking about the hack ofr 810

---------18:43----------
fiasco so this video right here

---------18:47----------
HECO f ra 10 review if we just search

---------18:50----------
hack ofr a 10 review this right here is

---------18:53----------
why hako is going to take that stuff and

---------18:55----------
just rub it all like they're gonna go on

---------18:57----------
a treadmill they're gonna do they're

---------18:59----------
gonna go for a run on the treadmill when

---------19:00----------
it's really hot they're gonna make sure

---------19:02----------
their balls get really nice and salty

---------19:03----------
with sweat they're gonna take those tips

---------19:05----------
rub it all over they're salty balls and

---------19:07----------
send it to me

---------19:08----------
so that's prob that's why I feel really

---------19:10----------
really strange about ordering anything

---------19:12----------
from hack oh I wanted to order from test

---------19:14----------
equipment depot so I ordered it from

---------19:15----------
hack oh they're gonna take those tips

---------19:17----------
they're gonna take oh now I get some

---------19:21----------
hello

---------19:24----------
sure

---------19:27----------
you have it been no I don't I'm not

---------19:29----------
gonna return it I promise all right so

---------19:32----------
let's see what we have here

---------19:33----------
Devin Olson you strongly overestimate

---------19:35----------
the intelligence of the average for a

---------19:37----------
delivery person there are certain places

---------19:40----------
where I order the same thing every day

---------19:42----------
the same thing every day for two years

---------19:44----------
the guy walks in the same person every

---------19:47----------
day for two years looks at the receipt

---------19:49----------
looks to the place looks to the receipt

---------19:50----------
looks at the place looks at the receipt

---------19:52----------
is this for you and then he doesn't

---------19:54----------
believe me and then he calls me not

---------19:56----------
kidding the same [ __ ] food every day

---------20:01----------
but we finally managed to Train one of

---------20:03----------
them six months ago

---------20:04----------
so that's yes six months ago I was able

---------20:06----------
to train the burrito place because I

---------20:09----------
took him in one time yeah I said here's

---------20:11----------
here's 50 bucks you know what I look

---------20:13----------
like

---------20:14----------
you know I ordered the same thing every

---------20:15----------
day nobody else orders this at this

---------20:16----------
address can you do me a favor when the

---------20:18----------
food comes in can you just put it on the

---------20:20----------
desk over there so that I can eat it and

---------20:22----------
then and I think that at that point we

---------20:24----------
had an understanding so this is the

---------20:25----------
board that I knocked everything off of

---------20:27----------
including the CD 3215 while I was doing

---------20:30----------
the reflow I knocked all this and all

---------20:32----------
that off I put that stuff on but you can

---------20:34----------
see that the capacitor is not exactly in

---------20:37----------
place where it's supposed to be but

---------20:38----------
that's all gonna flow on a place for us

---------20:40----------
nicely we're gonna take a nice new CD

---------20:42----------
3215 that CD 32:15 probably needs to be

---------20:45----------
replaced anyway that's just God's Way of

---------20:47----------
saying that we don't think that that CD

---------20:50----------
32:15 belongs there because it had

---------20:52----------
corrosion under it you should be using a

---------20:54----------
new one so we are gonna make it so that

---------20:55----------
when you saw it try to reflow what it's

---------20:57----------
not gonna work every now and then my

---------21:03----------
Lord and Savior the Spaghetti Monster

---------21:05----------
gives me an idea of what I should be

---------21:09----------
doing and here my Lord and Savior the

---------21:12----------
Spaghetti Monster was telling me that

---------21:14----------
the proper thing to do was replace that

---------21:16----------
chip rather than reflow

---------21:27----------
that being said let's solder our

---------21:30----------
replacement CD 3215 onto the board

---------21:38----------
these two capacitors up here are

---------21:40----------
touching themselves similar to my new

---------21:44----------
board repair employee on Friday night at

---------21:45----------
the burlesque club let's see if we can

---------21:47----------
get this chip to slide into place

---------21:48----------
pick up those capacitors up there to

---------21:50----------
stop touching themselves

---------22:02----------
finally so how long did it take for this

---------22:04----------
basic cd32 15 job like an hour an hour

---------22:07----------
and 41 minutes

---------22:09----------
camilo lauren l would have done this job

---------22:11----------
probably in five minutes and it would

---------22:13----------
have worked but because i'm an idiot

---------22:15----------
it took an hour and 42 minutes so now

---------22:20----------
we're going to see if we get 20 volts on

---------22:21----------
this and if it turns on this is why I

---------22:23----------
have been avoiding doing board repair

---------22:25----------
lately if you'd like you can rewind the

---------22:26----------
stream to the part where I knock every

---------22:27----------
single piece off of the board along with

---------22:29----------
the CD 3215 there's a man doing

---------22:31----------
cartwheels in the sidewalk and he's

---------22:33----------
looking into the store why are you doing

---------22:35----------
cartwheels you're strange strange man

---------22:37----------
I'm just gonna Glock my door again I

---------22:39----------
don't trust the cartwheeling man thieves

---------22:41----------
and gangster looking people man I don't

---------22:44----------
care people who do cartwheels at 2:00

---------22:47----------
a.m. when it's 40 degrees outside

---------22:48----------
don't [ __ ] with those people as you can

---------22:50----------
see we're up to 20 volts and we have one

---------22:53----------
amp 20 volts 1 amp 20 volts 1 amp so P P

---------22:58----------
3 V 3 underscore g3 hot was there we saw

---------23:00----------
some corrosion by the CD 30 to 15 I went

---------23:03----------
for a reflow and after reflow E and

---------23:06----------
trying to change the scene on the camera

---------23:08----------
instead of actually changing the scene

---------23:10----------
on the camera but by doing this my hand

---------23:13----------
decided to ignore me when I said go this

---------23:15----------
way and decided to do this too and

---------23:18----------
knocked everything off of the board so

---------23:21----------
then I used my sample book of resistors

---------23:24----------
to change everything that I knocked off

---------23:26----------
of the board I got a new CD 3215 and if

---------23:29----------
you need to know where to buy a new CD

---------23:31----------
3215 because you're an idiot and you

---------23:33----------
knock your scrote at CD 3215 off of the

---------23:36----------
board like I did had no further in-store

---------23:40----------
dot rossmann group.com where you can

---------23:43----------
find specialty items like the CD 3215 we

---------23:47----------
have iPhone audio ICS on sale we have

---------23:49----------
older tristar's on sale if you need a 16

---------23:52----------
1082 or a 16 1083 you may even find

---------23:55----------
these as low as one dollar and fifty

---------23:57----------
cents don't delay get your 1610 82 today

---------24:00----------
or you can get audio ICS if you buy

---------24:03----------
enough audio icees you get them as low

---------24:04----------
as a dollar in 69 cents but above all

---------24:06----------
you can get a CD 3215 for the low low

---------24:10----------
price of 1899 by four for $15.99

---------24:15----------
save 16% by 10 for $14.99 each and save

---------24:19----------
22% by 20 for $13.99 each and save 27%

---------24:23----------
the savings they stack that being said

---------24:26----------
this board works and as always I hope

---------24:29----------
you learned something being that if

---------24:32----------
you're an idiot and you can't control

---------24:34----------
your hand and your hand just happens to

---------24:36----------
the side hey instead of doing what my

---------24:38----------
nervous system asset to do I'm gonna

---------24:40----------
knock everything off of the board that

---------24:42----------
you can still fix it even on livestream

---------24:44----------
and with that I'll see you in the next

---------24:46----------
one I got my monitor a second monitor

---------24:48----------
over here I got my second wireless

---------24:50----------
microphone set up

---------24:51----------
I got a nice clean desk so we're gonna

---------24:53----------
have more live streams up here featuring

---------24:55----------
Paul a now and Camille on boards that

---------24:58----------
they all have picked at random I'm

---------25:00----------
cleaning up my setup here a little bit

---------25:02----------
and trying to make it a little bit

---------25:03----------
better I have not been streaming as many

---------25:05----------
board repairs due to annoying headaches

---------25:06----------
and I'm hoping to get rid of some of my

---------25:08----------
headaches by making my desk area a

---------25:10----------
little cleaner making the space a little

---------25:11----------
nicer so I have a dedicated open

---------25:13----------
broadcaster monitor so hopefully if

---------25:15----------
something's out of space in the

---------25:17----------
microscope it's not like it's all the

---------25:18----------
way in the bottom of the screen anymore

---------25:20----------
having to move around the open

---------25:21----------
broadcaster window the live chat window

---------25:22----------
and what I had on screen was a bit

---------25:25----------
annoying so now that's not the case

---------25:27----------
above all I finally got my wireless

---------25:29----------
setup working here so I got a wireless

---------25:31----------
mic for me I've also got another

---------25:33----------
wireless microphone before I had a wired

---------25:35----------
microphone and a wireless microphone

---------25:36----------
that wasn't working properly so I fixed

---------25:38----------
the frequencies and all that since

---------25:40----------
there's a lot of interference here so

---------25:41----------
you got a scan for frequencies on a

---------25:42----------
regular basis in order to not have

---------25:44----------
interference this is a Sennheiser II W

---------25:47----------
100 this is the shitty capsule this is

---------25:49----------
the e 835 I'm thinking of upgrading it

---------25:52----------
so at 8:45 865 or 945 or 965 I'm not

---------25:56----------
sure it's not the best thing in the

---------25:57----------
world but I think if I upgrade the

---------25:58----------
capsule I'll get something decent and I

---------25:59----------
also got a little stand for it so I can

---------26:00----------
always have it on the desk and it'll be

---------26:02----------
easy for just hand it to a customer or

---------26:03----------
to camille or to paul if there's

---------26:05----------
something interesting going on now we're

---------26:07----------
gonna talk about some upgrades that

---------26:09----------
we're doing for some other people the

---------26:10----------
first thing i've got here goes to rob

---------26:11----------
brown this is a microscope camera i

---------26:14----------
don't know what mount would fit on it

---------26:15----------
cuz i don't know what type of microscope

---------26:17----------
he has so i'm just gonna send them this

---------26:18----------
now the next thing that i've got here is

---------26:20----------
for somebody else who has been watching

---------26:22----------
for a very long time who I think

---------26:24----------
deserves and has earned getting a gift

---------26:27----------
of something really cool this he

---------26:29----------
is a wireless microphone system and this

---------26:33----------
is for Tim Herrmann

---------26:34----------
now Tim Herrmann I did a video on a few

---------26:37----------
days ago okay so I would highly suggest

---------26:38----------
that you watch this video 18 year old

---------26:40----------
viewer versus 18 year olds company he

---------26:43----------
did fix a board that was butchered by a

---------26:45----------
company that's been in business as long

---------26:47----------
as he has been alive and he did a

---------26:49----------
bang-up job of it and he does a YouTube

---------26:51----------
channel where he shows people and

---------26:52----------
educates people the same way that I do

---------26:54----------
so I tried to show him how to do this

---------26:56----------
stuff and now he is showing other people

---------26:58----------
the thing is that as much as it left him

---------26:59----------
his audio sucks it's abominable he

---------27:01----------
sounds like he's talking into her like

---------27:02----------
1920s carbon phone so I got him this

---------27:05----------
thing over here this is in my rack of

---------27:07----------
equipment that I'm likely not going to

---------27:08----------
use again for a long time so this is a

---------27:11----------
Shore wireless receiver this is a-you

---------27:13----------
for D - UA yes it's not like crazy

---------27:17----------
expensive but it's a decent little

---------27:19----------
receiver over here now this is two

---------27:20----------
channels so it has one handheld

---------27:23----------
microphone so that if Tim wants to have

---------27:25----------
customers in for repairs or guests or

---------27:27----------
there's customers that are interested in

---------27:28----------
watching live and Tim thinks that they

---------27:30----------
would make a good addition to his

---------27:31----------
streams or videos he can have them on

---------27:34----------
just clean this thing because I hate

---------27:35----------
microphones that smell like the breath

---------27:37----------
of the last person that used them it

---------27:38----------
drives me nuts so I always use a very

---------27:41----------
very damp microfiber cloth and something

---------27:44----------
like I'm using the screen cleaning

---------27:45----------
liquid over here to clean it off I clean

---------27:47----------
my microphone - and over here we have a

---------27:50----------
countryman be six so this is very

---------27:52----------
similar to my DP a great Mike countryman

---------27:55----------
and DP a it's kind of like Coke versus

---------27:58----------
Pepsi so this is untangled and this is

---------28:00----------
going to go to a Shore you one - you a

---------28:03----------
wrist Ran's Mitter this is kind of cheap

---------28:06----------
[ __ ] but it works very it works decently

---------28:07----------
well I used to use this for my older

---------28:10----------
streams it looks like it must be

---------28:12----------
discontinued or something because I

---------28:13----------
don't see a lot of places actually

---------28:14----------
selling it it's not crazy but it does

---------28:17----------
the job it doesn't have the longest

---------28:18----------
range in the world but I could get from

---------28:20----------
the front of the store to the back of

---------28:21----------
the store with this thing you get a good

---------28:22----------
like I'd say 50 50 feet of usable range

---------28:25----------
with it and this little microphone here

---------28:28----------
so this is a countryman e6

---------28:35----------
I prefer DPA personally I like the sound

---------28:37----------
of DPA more than countryman but this is

---------28:39----------
still a nice little microphone it's it

---------28:42----------
doesn't look as nice

---------28:43----------
and sexy in person as it does in the

---------28:45----------
picture it's kind of like you know

---------28:46----------
McDonald's or any sort of fast-food

---------28:49----------
where it looks sexier in the picture

---------28:50----------
than it does when you actually get it

---------28:52----------
but this is a nice little microphone and

---------28:54----------
transmitter so we've got here a

---------28:56----------
microphone transmitter a countryman East

---------28:59----------
six microphone an sm58 wireless customer

---------29:03----------
microphone for Tim if he wants to

---------29:04----------
include customers on the stream the

---------29:06----------
antennas ends this sure you a u4d you a

---------29:12----------
receiver now he's just gonna have to

---------29:14----------
find a audio interface to plug it into

---------29:17----------
this has to yeah what is this is this

---------29:20----------
line out or mic out I forget if this is

---------29:23----------
line output or mic output actually we're

---------29:28----------
closed we are closed you can keep

---------29:31----------
putting your okay oh what's your

---------29:35----------
question what is your question a CD

---------29:45----------
there's nothing I can do with that

---------29:51----------
probably I don't know yeah you should

---------29:55----------
try wiping it off but if it's a cracked

---------29:56----------
CD I can't do anything with it no I'm

---------30:04----------
sorry no not if it's cracked that's

---------30:11----------
possible we just don't do it yeah get

---------30:14----------
exactly get a program called CD X it'll

---------30:16----------
do it for you CD e x c DX c de x so

---------30:22----------
that's how you spell it

---------30:23----------
CD e^x it does what you're asking me so

---------30:29----------
the question you ask me of how to do

---------30:30----------
that of can I do that that's the program

---------30:32----------
that'll do it for you that is why you

---------30:33----------
leave your door locked and never open it

---------30:35----------
after closing because people will ask

---------30:37----------
you to open the door after closing

---------30:38----------
because they have just one question but

---------30:40----------
that just one question is never a

---------30:42----------
question in a moment we'll make you

---------30:44----------
money never so here for Tim you've got

---------30:46----------
the shore u4d you a receiver we've got

---------30:50----------
the shore sm58 wireless mic so that he

---------30:52----------
can have a customer or a guest on his

---------30:54----------
stream and

---------30:55----------
we have a countryman ecigs

---------30:58----------
wireless omnidirectional head one

---------31:00----------
microphone for him and a you on you a

---------31:02----------
transmitter so what Tim's gonna need in

---------31:05----------
order to get good sound on a stream is

---------31:06----------
an audio interface to plug it into that

---------31:08----------
does not have latency so if any of you

---------31:10----------
can recommend him an audio interface

---------31:12----------
that doesn't add latency that would be

---------31:13----------
great I actually went back to using the

---------31:15----------
mic preamps and analog to digital

---------31:17----------
converter inside my camcorder because I

---------31:19----------
was I was trying to have this Presonus

---------31:22----------
audio interface work with my microphones

---------31:24----------
and I would plug the microphones into

---------31:25----------
the Presonus audio interface I'd set the

---------31:27----------
buffer size to 64 and people would still

---------31:29----------
complain that randomly the audio would

---------31:31----------
be out of sync so I just said screw it

---------31:32----------
I'm just gonna keep using this giant

---------31:34----------
camcorder here I got an audio interface

---------31:36----------
in the hopes that I could get a smaller

---------31:37----------
camcorder I use this large giant Sony

---------31:40----------
NEX EA 50 it's a nice camcorder it's

---------31:44----------
just this is ridiculously overkill for

---------31:46----------
the very very tiny workspace and desk

---------31:48----------
that I have here but this camcorder has

---------31:49----------
XLR inputs and an HDMI out which mate

---------31:53----------
which is really convenient for me so I

---------31:55----------
can plug the microphones into that and

---------31:56----------
then just use the HDMI capture card and

---------31:58----------
since the audio is being sent with the

---------32:01----------
same device that is sending the video

---------32:02----------
there's no such thing as out of sync the

---------32:04----------
audio is always going to be in sync

---------32:06----------
because the audio and video are coming

---------32:07----------
from the same device or as so I was

---------32:09----------
using a Presonus device to deal with

---------32:13----------
audio let me see if I can find what I

---------32:14----------
was using and it wasn't bad it was just

---------32:18----------
every now and then people were saying

---------32:20----------
that the audio was yeah I think it was

---------32:21----------
using one uh-huh yeah this was my so

---------32:23----------
this is the pretty sonís interface that

---------32:24----------
I used to have and it's not a bad

---------32:27----------
interface by any means it's just that

---------32:29----------
people would constantly complain that

---------32:30----------
sometimes my audio wasn't sync sometimes

---------32:33----------
it was and I tried all different types

---------32:35----------
of settings I've tried it on two

---------32:36----------
different computers and I tried setting

---------32:39----------
my buffer size to 64 within their

---------32:41----------
Universal control software and I always

---------32:43----------
had audio sync issues so if anybody can

---------32:45----------
suggest an interface for Tim's computer

---------32:48----------
he has USB 3 ports on it that would

---------32:50----------
allow him to use this receiver without

---------32:53----------
having ridiculous amounts of latency

---------32:55----------
since he uses a separate camera from the

---------32:57----------
audio gear that would be great I don't

---------32:59----------
have one to send him here and also if

---------33:01----------
anybody could suggest for Rob Brown

---------33:04----------
where he could get some decent adapters

---------33:08----------
for his microscope if

---------33:09----------
mentions his model microscope in the

---------33:11----------
comments for this microscope camera that

---------33:12----------
he's getting I do let me know but yeah I

---------33:14----------
think Tim and Rob have genuinely earned

---------33:16----------
it

---------33:17----------
especially Tim for constantly doing

---------33:19----------
videos on a regular basis and I really

---------33:21----------
hope that he produces some stuff of

---------33:22----------
higher quality now that or at the very

---------33:24----------
least stop sounding like [ __ ] because

---------33:26----------
he's using a microphone that was

---------33:27----------
recommended to him by Paul Daniels never

---------33:30----------
trust Paul Daniels
