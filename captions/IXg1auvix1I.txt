---------00:00----------
so let's get started with the 8 to 0 37

---------00:02----------
87 that is not turning on so we're going

---------00:04----------
to plug it in and see what it does and

---------00:07----------
we get no light on the charger and it is

---------00:11----------
dead this is going to allow the charger

---------00:12----------
to talk to the SMC let's look on 10 one

---------00:15----------
of you 7000 come on turn down the

---------00:19----------
exposure this is advice okay

---------00:33----------
so what am i measuring see pen for is

---------00:36----------
one wire okay pin 1 and 1 it supposed to

---------00:39----------
be pp is to see if this is turning on

---------00:41----------
and this chip is turning on I'm getting

---------00:43----------
three point three seven volts at this

---------00:45----------
chip yet I'm getting a zero for my for

---------00:49----------
my green light so let's see what adapter

---------00:51----------
sentences adapter sent is going to show

---------00:52----------
up on pin five over here

---------01:00----------
that's kind of weird that's low 0.7

---------01:02----------
volts and adapter sense I'm not sure if

---------01:04----------
maybe that's something different from AG

---------01:05----------
save too but that seems kind of low to

---------01:06----------
me hmm that seems low seems too low look

---------01:16----------
what the DCN board looks like you see in

---------01:21----------
board ooh you crusty you broken

---------01:25----------
[Music]

---------01:31----------
seriously there you go okay dcn board

---------01:37----------
got the light on but you're still dead

---------01:42----------
why are you still dead all right let's

---------01:46----------
check out what adaptor senses now

---------01:47----------
remember adapter sense is supposed to be

---------01:50----------
somewhere between usually around two

---------01:52----------
point nine volts if it's 16 that's bad

---------01:54----------
that means that charger voltage is

---------01:56----------
getting into the sense line and if it's

---------01:57----------
too low that's also bad if it's too low

---------02:00----------
it's bad because that means that that

---------02:03----------
it's not communicating so do that so

---------02:05----------
that so the adapter sends voltage is

---------02:08----------
going to let me know if the DCN board is

---------02:09----------
good or not most of the time so now we

---------02:11----------
got a green light but it's dead so the

---------02:13----------
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going

---------02:14----------
to check the rest of my voltages on the

---------02:15----------
list let's check out PB bus g3 huh

---------02:26----------
you know

---------02:32----------
on the fuse and if you're short at the

---------02:35----------
ground this is getting sold

---------02:37----------
gtfo your four folds okay so four volts

---------02:46----------
sucks because that means that we're not

---------02:48----------
sure it's ground but that we're not also

---------02:50----------
not creating the rail but it's still

---------02:52----------
better than being fully shorted if it

---------02:54----------
was one point seven volts or 0.7 volts

---------02:56----------
then I'd be screwed so let's see if

---------02:58----------
there's a short circuit that's not a

---------03:00----------
short circuit for a line that's attached

---------03:01----------
just about everything yeah that's fine

---------03:04----------
that's what we're expecting like

---------03:05----------
somewhere between 0.125 to 0.184 so now

---------03:09----------
let's look at the area that's going to

---------03:10----------
create PP buzz g3 huh which is the you

---------03:12----------
70-100 area so there's a couple of

---------03:19----------
things that we're going to be looking

---------03:19----------
for here first thing is how does it look

---------03:25----------
how healthy does it look visually

---------03:29----------
visually it looks pretty nice so the

---------03:31----------
first thing that I'm going to go through

---------03:33----------
here is let's see what voltage I get on

---------03:34----------
charge or DC n at pin 2 then we're also

---------03:37----------
going to look for I'm sure you can't see

---------03:39----------
that what do we get on charge of DC in

---------03:40----------
at pin to do we get PP 5 v 1 charge or

---------03:43----------
VDD P then also we're going to go over

---------03:45----------
the current sensing section we're going

---------03:46----------
to make sure that these resistors for

---------03:47----------
CSI current sensing current sensing for

---------03:51----------
charger i stands for charger and here we

---------03:53----------
have current sensing for battery o

---------03:55----------
stands for battery that that's that's an

---------03:57----------
addition in this language so i'm

---------03:59----------
guessing that that's part of some other

---------04:01----------
language all right so charge a DC in

---------04:03----------
pres it now we're going to do is we're

---------04:07----------
going to check our current sensing

---------04:08----------
section so what here we have a loop so

---------04:14----------
this is the current sensing resistor

---------04:15----------
there's going to be a voltage drop

---------04:16----------
across this resistor and the voltage

---------04:18----------
drop across our 7120 is going to be

---------04:20----------
proportional to the amount of current

---------04:22----------
the system is using so here you have

---------04:23----------
where it says from adapter so that this

---------04:26----------
entire point of this page of the circuit

---------04:27----------
is to take the 16 or 18 volts in the

---------04:29----------
charger and turn it into 12 volts for

---------04:31----------
the system so it's going to come through

---------04:33----------
here here so the more current going

---------04:37----------
through this resistor the greater the

---------04:39----------
voltage drop will be between the

---------04:41----------
beginning and the end now our 7121 and

---------04:44----------
our 71 22 are going to deliver

---------04:46----------
those voltages to use 7100 you 7100 is

---------04:49----------
going to compare them and once the

---------04:50----------
voltage difference is too great it turns

---------04:52----------
off the circuit or disables it so since

---------04:54----------
there is a 10 ohm resistor then a 0.02

---------04:58----------
of resistor no the federal reserve's

---------05:00----------
care that means that I get to go to

---------05:01----------
sleep I mean that means that hey that

---------05:03----------
the resistance that I get between 10 27

---------05:05----------
and 28 should be the sum of all those

---------05:07----------
resistances which would be twenty point

---------05:09----------
zero two ohms so let's find pins 27 and

---------05:14----------
28 now as you can see here the

---------05:16----------
resistance I get between 10 27 and 28 is

---------05:19----------
3 million ohms 3 million is higher than

---------05:23----------
20 point zero 2 which means that one of

---------05:26----------
these resistors or both of them are

---------05:27----------
blown as you can see here each of these

---------05:30----------
resistors has a little hole on the top

---------05:32----------
of it see each of those resistors has a

---------05:35----------
hole in it

---------05:35----------
which means that they are blown now

---------05:38----------
what's going to cause those resistors to

---------05:40----------
blow often what's going to cause those

---------05:42----------
resistors to blow is a path to ground

---------05:44----------
so those resistors sit between the

---------05:46----------
charger and use 7100 if you 70 100 goes

---------05:50----------
bad then it was short to ground if you

---------05:53----------
70 100 is shorted to ground then the

---------05:55----------
things that are plugged into you 70 100

---------05:57----------
are also short it's a ground like let's

---------05:59----------
say the current sensing section so we're

---------06:01----------
not just going to replace the current

---------06:02----------
sensing resistors if the only problem

---------06:04----------
where that the traces were bad so let's

---------06:07----------
say we were in a in a case where the

---------06:09----------
only issue with these with this circuit

---------06:11----------
was that the trace this to that was

---------06:14----------
broken this was ripped up off the board

---------06:16----------
or this probe point was liquid damaged

---------06:17----------
then we probably would not have to

---------06:19----------
replace the used 70 100 and often we

---------06:21----------
wouldn't even have to replace the

---------06:22----------
resistors

---------06:22----------
however since each resistor is blown and

---------06:24----------
the system is cosmetically perfect the

---------06:28----------
issue is most likely going to be an

---------06:30----------
electrical issue so if I were to measure

---------06:31----------
resistance to ground and either one of

---------06:33----------
those pins I have a feeling that it's

---------06:36----------
going to be very low and as you can see

---------06:39----------
here I'm being proven wrong

---------06:40----------
let's check this and I'm not being

---------06:43----------
proven wrong because on pin 28 we have a

---------06:45----------
2 point 1 ohm resistance to ground

---------06:47----------
meaning the u 7100 is shorted to ground

---------06:50----------
so if i were to replace our 7121 and our

---------06:53----------
71 22 it would be pointless because as

---------06:56----------
soon as i plug in the charger they blow

---------06:57----------
again because u 70 100 which is our

---------06:59----------
primary fault is causing the secondary

---------07:02----------
fault of our current sensors is blind so

---------07:04----------
we're going to repeal and replace both

---------07:06----------
you 7100 and the current sense resistors

---------07:08----------
in order to fix this problem so let's

---------07:10----------
get the rework station on and get going

---------07:31----------
let's get a tiny bit of flux on there

---------07:39----------
we're going to preheat the board a

---------07:41----------
little bit since my office is cold and I

---------07:42----------
have not done any soldering on this

---------07:43----------
board yet don't want a thermally shock

---------07:45----------
it are not streaming on your other

---------07:50----------
platform anymore

---------07:51----------
no I'm streaming to youtube but just a

---------07:55----------
different channel on YouTube that's

---------07:56----------
meant for live video only

---------08:59----------
just about done preheating

---------09:11----------
now we can go in and repeal some stuff

---------09:15----------
also might as well turn off the

---------09:17----------
multimeter

---------09:31----------
so that is all been repealed now we're

---------09:35----------
going to wick the board and after we

---------09:37----------
wick out the old solder it'll be time

---------09:39----------
for the replacement stage

---------09:56----------
so now we're going to add some let it

---------09:59----------
solder here because adding let it solder

---------10:00----------
makes it easier to repeal the lead-free

---------10:03----------
solder now I'm going to take some wick

---------10:13----------
and we are going to repeal the lead-free

---------10:17----------
leaded solder combination that we asked

---------10:38----------
remember wicking is the professional way

---------10:40----------
to repair

---------10:41----------
I learned this while I was teaching with

---------10:43----------
Jesse iPad rehab right before I quit

---------10:47----------
teaching with her she said I don't want

---------10:49----------
you to leave here without understanding

---------10:50----------
the secret to how it is I have the

---------10:53----------
highest success rate in the industry for

---------10:55----------
liquid damage data recovery and I said

---------10:57----------
Jessa what's the secret please tell me

---------10:58----------
the secret and she said I wick every pad

---------11:01----------
on every qf p qf n & BGA that I work on

---------11:05----------
and I said wow thank you so much and

---------11:07----------
I've been following that advice for the

---------11:09----------
past two years and as a result of

---------11:11----------
following that advice all of my repairs

---------11:13----------
go amazing wick everything what great

---------11:23----------
advice

---------11:23----------
I just want to never thought of it on my

---------11:25----------
own

---------11:35----------
clean the area off

---------11:39----------
okay so I can safely say that the

---------11:41----------
lead-free solder and the old chips have

---------11:45----------
been repealed

---------12:57----------
you

---------13:28----------
okay now we're going to go for the is L

---------13:31----------
six two five nine

---------14:04----------
okay get it sided on there now it's not

---------14:08----------
flat on the board just yet so I need it

---------14:10----------
to be flat on the board so I'm going to

---------14:16----------
push

---------14:52----------
that was dumb you're going to put that

---------14:55----------
back into place in a second actually not

---------15:00----------
the ideal tip to be using the touch-up

---------15:01----------
QFP pads but we like to live on the edge

---------15:06----------
and put you back in a place where I can

---------15:15----------
never happen all right

---------16:05----------
Wolfgang says I think Eli is writing the

---------16:07----------
YouTube drama thingy to attract more

---------16:09----------
views no comment

---------16:24----------
no comment

---------16:34----------
[Music]

---------16:36----------
damnit you're going to make me use flux

---------16:39----------
to touch that up aren't you

---------16:44----------
[Music]

---------16:50----------
all right

---------17:04----------
okay so now before I plug it in I'm

---------17:08----------
going to check the resistance to grounds

---------17:10----------
on my current sends lines just to make

---------17:13----------
sure that nothing funny is happening and

---------17:16----------
take black probe ground red probe and

---------17:18----------
current sent

---------17:27----------
hello what's the range that we're in

---------17:30----------
there okay so in line change the range

---------17:37----------
too

---------17:54----------
all right I'd say that we're pretty safe

---------17:56----------
here except I didn't really get the top

---------18:00----------
done nicely since I was using that large

---------18:02----------
BCM to tip which is really inappropriate

---------18:04----------
for qfm soldering I was being lazy if

---------18:08----------
you caught me being lazy there for a

---------18:10----------
moment I really should have had the

---------18:11----------
something else on a little better for

---------18:15----------
that but yeah at this point it's clear

---------18:18----------
that our issue with the short on the

---------18:21----------
current sense line is gone and it's see

---------18:25----------
much cleaner much cleaner

---------18:39----------
okay so now we're going to plug it in

---------18:41----------
and see if the fan spins so this is the

---------18:44----------
fan look how look how pretty it is this

---------18:48----------
is my charger

---------18:58----------
it spins isn't that great so that's how

---------19:04----------
we repair a machine that's dead not

---------19:06----------
turning on that is how we figure out if

---------19:08----------
the DCN board is bad or not before you

---------19:10----------
even grab a new DC n board the adapter

---------19:12----------
sense line will give you some good hints

---------19:13----------
as to whether your DC n board is good

---------19:15----------
what 32.9 to three volts good 16 volts

---------19:18----------
very bad charger voltage is making its

---------19:20----------
way into the adapter sense line and zero

---------19:22----------
anything considerably below two volts or

---------19:25----------
0.7 volts means that it's not doing its

---------19:27----------
job it's not working at all and now time

---------19:30----------
for an advertisement this is our website

---------19:32----------
here mail in dot repair you will be able

---------19:34----------
to find on most of the different

---------19:36----------
cleaners stencils connectors ICS

---------19:39----------
and small ships that we use throughout

---------19:41----------
these repairs on this website so here

---------19:44----------
you'll find the ultrasonic cleaner that

---------19:46----------
we use at the store that's fixed many of

---------19:48----------
the boards that I was unable to fix in

---------19:49----------
the video this here is shipped straight

---------19:51----------
from the store here you'll see a bunch

---------19:53----------
of LCD connectors we've got keyboard

---------19:55----------
connectors we've got digitizer

---------19:57----------
connectors and they're all organized

---------19:59----------
here so if you go connectors by type or

---------20:01----------
you can search by your device so if we

---------20:03----------
go here components by device iPhone

---------20:05----------
iPhone 6's it'll bring you to a screen

---------20:08----------
where you'll find a bunch of different

---------20:10----------
parts for your iPhone the same is true

---------20:12----------
for stencils we've got stencils over

---------20:14----------
here like the SMC stencil that it's

---------20:15----------
typically hard to buy directly in

---------20:18----------
America you have to wait a long time to

---------20:19----------
get that from China here we've got the

---------20:22----------
some different parts like the LPP 3v4 to

---------20:25----------
regulator over here so this is a TP 3

---------20:28----------
before to regulator you can actually

---------20:30----------
search by the number on the schematic

---------20:32----------
and if there are different chips with

---------20:34----------
that same number it'll bring up all the

---------20:35----------
different ships you can scroll down and

---------20:37----------
figure out which one is for your

---------20:38----------
motherboard because over here it'll say

---------20:40----------
compatible boards and it will list all

---------20:42----------
the boards the chip is compatible with

---------20:44----------
if you don't want to deal with that you

---------20:45----------
can even just search by your motherboard

---------20:47----------
so if I search over here for a t20 3462

---------20:50----------
it will only show me chips that are

---------20:52----------
compatible with my model motherboard and

---------20:56----------
this was all put together we have high

---------20:58----------
resolution pictures that you can compare

---------21:00----------
it to your chip to make sure that you

---------21:02----------
buy the right one and if you ever have a

---------21:04----------
question feel free to email feel free to

---------21:06----------
comment feel free to live chat so thank

---------21:08----------
you very much for watching the video

---------21:09----------
thank you very much for your

---------21:11----------
patronage if you use their website we've

---------21:13----------
also got flux here if you want flux

---------21:15----------
we've got solder paste over here if you

---------21:18----------
want solder paste
