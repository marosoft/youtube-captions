---------00:00----------
all right so let's check this out so we

---------00:02----------
have an a 1398 board that won't turn on

---------00:05----------
so first thing I'm gonna do is plug in

---------00:07----------
the charger and see what I get and it's

---------00:09----------
drawing 0.168 amps on my power supply

---------00:12----------
0.168 amps is actually a really nice

---------00:14----------
number see if we're drawing 0.02 amps

---------00:18----------
that would mean that I'm most likely

---------00:20----------
missing p.m. sleep s4l that's no fun

---------00:23----------
why are you hissing o p.m. sleep s4l I

---------00:27----------
have proof I would hiss at that as well

---------00:29----------
so it's not missing p.m. slave s4l so

---------00:31----------
I'm not gonna go that doesn't make me

---------00:35----------
want to hiss we may actually get off

---------00:36----------
easy with there being some short on some

---------00:38----------
power rail that's gonna be easy breezy

---------00:40----------
to figure out so the reaction to

---------00:42----------
yesterday's video is interesting

---------00:44----------
actually feel a little bit bad now I

---------00:45----------
feel a little little little mean I mean

---------00:48----------
like the guy the guy deserved to get

---------00:50----------
served but some of the comments he's

---------00:53----------
getting sheesh somebody's got to

---------00:55----------
practice how they hit the report spam

---------00:58----------
button that guy was a [ __ ] since dock

---------01:00----------
vault yeah that's the thing I tried to

---------01:02----------
do the video where I was respectfully

---------01:05----------
stating my case and it started out that

---------01:07----------
way and by the time I got to the end of

---------01:08----------
the video I just you can see my patients

---------01:11----------
went down the further I was going I

---------01:12----------
started that off with the best of

---------01:14----------
intentions I started that video off with

---------01:16----------
the absolute best of intentions and that

---------01:20----------
is what it turned into

---------01:21----------
I mean I couldn't that's the thing it's

---------01:25----------
not I don't care if somebody likes Apple

---------01:27----------
I don't care if they if you know if you

---------01:29----------
like Final Cut Pro and logic and you

---------01:30----------
like iMessage integrating with the

---------01:32----------
computer that that's great that's cool I

---------01:34----------
have no problem with that but I don't

---------01:36----------
like when Apple uses the fact that they

---------01:39----------
have this great ecosystem to abuse their

---------01:42----------
customers and to make them think that

---------01:43----------
there's something wrong with them when

---------01:45----------
it's actually something wrong with Apple

---------01:46----------
that bothers me on EP bus g3 hot we get

---------01:49----------
12 point 57 all right so let's move on

---------01:51----------
to the next rail PPV RTC g3 hot 3.3 BP 5

---------01:57----------
es 5 comes next 5 volts and it's

---------02:03----------
consistent EP 5 vs 4

---------02:13----------
is there all right so we're in an s4

---------02:15----------
state let's see is BP 5 es 3 their 0.13

---------02:25----------
so we're not an s3 state let's try and

---------02:28----------
figure out why we're not in s3 state

---------02:29----------
where does PB 5 years 3 come from that's

---------02:32----------
gonna come from this FET that's gonna

---------02:33----------
come from P 5 es 3 en el enable all

---------02:36----------
right so that's gonna come from P 5 es 3

---------02:38----------
and that's gonna come from p f-- p.m.

---------02:40----------
sleep best for oh no no no no damn it

---------02:44----------
Paul's hiss was correct when Paul hissed

---------02:46----------
it was entirely on point we may be

---------02:48----------
missing p.m. sleep as for L yes it's

---------02:52----------
0.05 but that doesn't make any sense

---------02:54----------
that's not a valid state I say all right

---------02:57----------
well let's see if P V 3 V 3 s 5 is

---------02:59----------
present by the way thank you for the 100

---------03:01----------
rube excellent video on bengay deniers

---------03:03----------
may ask when and how did you learn about

---------03:05----------
Tyler Tyler Tyler syv Tech I learned

---------03:08----------
about tylose I've tech from all of you

---------03:10----------
commenting constantly for the past three

---------03:12----------
months saying please respond to this

---------03:15----------
person and I don't do response videos

---------03:16----------
it's not my thing but it was the f every

---------03:20----------
single day somebody would ask and then I

---------03:21----------
saw I don't thing is I don't care if you

---------03:23----------
defend Apple products I don't care what

---------03:25----------
I what I care about is when you say that

---------03:26----------
it didn't happen

---------03:27----------
don't deny the experience of the users

---------03:29----------
don't deny the experience of the abuse

---------03:31----------
that's all I'm asking it didn't pissed

---------03:33----------
me off in the sense of you're defending

---------03:34----------
apples bad products fine whatever

---------03:36----------
it pissed me off from the sense that

---------03:38----------
you're denying the experience of the

---------03:40----------
abuse it's like listening to somebody

---------03:42----------
defend a you know Chris Brown after he

---------03:44----------
beat Rihanna that kind of thing some

---------03:46----------
missing p.m. sleep best for L so p.m.

---------03:48----------
sleeve s4l is gonna come from the PCH

---------03:50----------
the PCH is gonna create that signal

---------03:52----------
that's where it starts and the PCH is

---------03:54----------
powered by P P 3 V 3 is 5 so we have P P

---------03:57----------
3 B 3 s 5 but we're missing p.m. sleep s

---------04:00----------
for L so let's take a look around the

---------04:01----------
PCH area and see if anything that looks

---------04:03----------
nasty it's gonna give this board a nice

---------04:04----------
look over you'll put this thing back

---------04:07----------
together

---------04:07----------
ok now let's have a vote let's let chat

---------04:09----------
decide let's live chat decide all right

---------04:11----------
check this out now come back here we're

---------04:13----------
gonna we're gonna see who's the side in

---------04:15----------
this all right if somebody puts the

---------04:17----------
machine back together like this is the

---------04:20----------
person who didn't notice it equally

---------04:21----------
culpable as the person who did

---------04:23----------
okay so who did it wait so you're saying

---------04:26----------
he did it I miss being a one-person

---------04:33----------
business sometimes holy [ __ ] Daniel says

---------04:35----------
he didn't but you okay if you see this

---------04:42----------
if you see the cable plug didn't read

---------04:43----------
like this if the cable was plugged in

---------04:46----------
like this instead of the other way

---------04:47----------
around why are you lying about then

---------04:49----------
either being the one that put it back

---------04:50----------
together tell me hey come here Dan I'd

---------04:57----------
say yeah yeah okay I think it's time

---------04:59----------
that you two settle this the way that

---------05:00----------
you're supposed to with violence all

---------05:02----------
right so I would say J come on okay both

---------05:47----------
of you both of you go outside and

---------05:48----------
whoever manages whoever manages to come

---------05:50----------
back in will be the person who still

---------05:52----------
works here

---------06:03----------
okay Steve can you decide who still

---------06:05----------
works here in the half hour I can't do

---------06:07----------
city that sounds like a job for

---------06:08----------
management so back to white p.m. sleep

---------06:12----------
s4l is missing on this eight to zero

---------06:14----------
zero zero four to six board it appears

---------06:16----------
we have PP bus g3 huh we have PP 5vs5 we

---------06:19----------
have PP 3 V 3 is 5 but we're missing the

---------06:21----------
M sleep as for L however p.m. sleep s

---------06:24----------
for L is not in a valid state it's not

---------06:26----------
zero volt it's not 3.3 volts 0.06 volts

---------06:29----------
which doesn't seem to be correct so

---------06:38----------
that's not a valid state or it's got a

---------06:42----------
little a couple of tubes on it but

---------06:44----------
certainly not enough cubes the hahahaha

---------06:46----------
what is this what's that oh did I get an

---------06:49----------
easy one I got an easy p.m. sleep is for

---------06:52----------
L missing

---------06:53----------
look at that look at the solder balls

---------06:56----------
that was an interesting stereo ooh I'm

---------06:59----------
curious what that is because I gotta add

---------07:01----------
this to my list of things that kill p.m.

---------07:03----------
sleep us 4 L so what are you you're the

---------07:05----------
USB port power switch so could a USB

---------07:08----------
port power switch do this this is also

---------07:10----------
interesting not heat gun you can see the

---------07:13----------
way that this failed this hasn't been

---------07:14----------
touched before

---------07:15----------
those are solder balls that popped out

---------07:16----------
as a result of the chip burning and if

---------07:18----------
you look really close in on the chip

---------07:19----------
you'll see that it's burned and that on

---------07:21----------
the top of it it's actually bent

---------07:23----------
see that it's not an even surface I'm

---------07:25----------
gonna try to get this at an angled view

---------07:27----------
for you so that you can see what I mean

---------07:28----------
when I say that's not an even surface

---------07:30----------
alright see do you see that in the

---------07:32----------
middle of the chip it's sticking up a

---------07:33----------
little bit so I bet if I take this USB

---------07:36----------
power port circuitry off that we're

---------07:38----------
gonna have a fan spin

---------07:52----------
yeah the all right so I'm going to plug

---------07:54----------
this machine in and as you can see our

---------07:57----------
PM sleeve s4o problem is gone it's

---------07:58----------
turning on and it works
