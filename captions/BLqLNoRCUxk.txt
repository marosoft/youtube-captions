---------00:00----------
hi so today we're going to be going over

---------00:01----------
a board that had no trackpad and also no

---------00:03----------
keyboard and I'm little bit mayor say

---------00:09----------
that we actually replaced the trackpad

---------00:11----------
the keyboard and the trackpad capable

---------00:15----------
before it finally wound up on my desk

---------00:18----------
because after doing all this it still

---------00:20----------
didn't work so I looked at it for a

---------00:23----------
while I tried the whole new trackpad

---------00:25----------
keyboard obviously you can see that

---------00:26----------
because I have it on my desk and I

---------00:28----------
wasn't really using my brain because I

---------00:30----------
did the exact same thing now one of the

---------00:33----------
things that you should look at in this

---------00:34----------
circuit to figure out why it is it's

---------00:36----------
doing that just look at this commander

---------00:39----------
let's follow along and do some basic

---------00:40----------
troubleshooting so this is the keyboard

---------00:42----------
connector right J 5700 so we look for J

---------00:48----------
5700 and we see this IPD flex connector

---------00:51----------
now I checked over here I check that pp

---------00:55----------
3 v 3s for trackpad was making it to the

---------00:57----------
trackpad I track that pp 3 v 3s for

---------01:00----------
trackpad was making it to this chip over

---------01:02----------
here that takes the input from the

---------01:04----------
keyboard in the trackpad and sends it

---------01:06----------
off I checked that pp 3 v 4 200 square G

---------01:09----------
3 hot trackpad was going to the trackpad

---------01:11----------
I check that the sleep signal was over

---------01:13----------
here going to the Select line so then

---------01:15----------
let's follow along USB T pad - R than P

---------01:19----------
so these are two signals from the data

---------01:22----------
line the P and the N signal and they

---------01:25----------
head over here to USB underscore tack

---------01:30----------
pad underscore hub underscore P and N

---------01:33----------
and that goes over to this chip over

---------01:35----------
here this is a little USB hub now again

---------01:39----------
we have bluetooth trackpad keyboard SMC

---------01:42----------
port and SD card this chip had power

---------01:44----------
going to it so I decided you know what

---------01:45----------
let's see if the SD card reader works

---------01:47----------
and I don't have an SD card reader so I

---------01:49----------
decided to see if the Bluetooth worked

---------01:50----------
and the Bluetooth didn't work even

---------01:52----------
though on that exact same operating

---------01:53----------
system and same try but worked with

---------01:55----------
another computer so what happens when I

---------01:56----------
look over that area in the microscope

---------01:58----------
but this is this is what we wasted an

---------02:05----------
hour on this before it

---------02:09----------
got to my desk this you see that let's

---------02:12----------
see what what that is

---------02:13----------
so we go over to the board view over

---------02:15----------
here and that's supposed to be our 2600

---------02:21----------
so we're gonna try and see what happens

---------02:23----------
when we put our 2600 on so our 2000

---------02:27----------
tired of being sick men our 2600 is a 12

---------02:32----------
kilo ohm resistor that goes between USB

---------02:34----------
hub 1 our bias and ground and let's just

---------02:38----------
look it up to see what it does USB 2 5 1

---------02:40----------
3 B ok let's see what that little line

---------02:43----------
does because I always like to show you

---------02:45----------
how you can find all this information in

---------02:47----------
the datasheet I don't want to brochure I

---------02:49----------
want a datasheet okay let's see pin out

---------02:54----------
we're going to ignore all this junk we

---------02:56----------
see here you probably don't understand

---------02:58----------
what half of it means I don't understand

---------03:00----------
what at least 3/4 of it means I'm not

---------03:02----------
even going to try

---------03:03----------
so which pin are we interested in it is

---------03:05----------
pin 35 so pin 35 is our bias

---------03:10----------
what is our bias do resistor is attached

---------03:14----------
from ground to this pin to set the

---------03:15----------
transceivers internal bias settings I'm

---------03:18----------
pretty sure if that's not attached that

---------03:19----------
it won't work it's nothing that I didn't

---------03:21----------
know if I you know then already know

---------03:23----------
just from common common sense in

---------03:25----------
the fact that this doesn't work

---------03:26----------
right now so we're going to add a little

---------03:28----------
bit of solder over there

---------03:30----------
that's right solder with two DS mofos

---------03:33----------
because I don't want to say it with

---------03:35----------
Canal oh I hate soldering when sick as

---------03:43----------
nothing you see what I scrape that

---------03:46----------
right there

---------03:46----------
right over there you could see like when

---------03:48----------
I coughed how I just kind of dug into

---------03:50----------
the board by the way this board already

---------03:52----------
has a lot of [ __ ] going on as you can

---------03:54----------
see yeah we got that going all the way

---------03:59----------
to the other side here for battery

---------04:02----------
charging stuff so II there's all sorts

---------04:05----------
of fun stuff going on on this board

---------04:06----------
already

---------04:07----------
but this keyboard thing was just too

---------04:09----------
much it really it really is it's one of

---------04:11----------
those things where it's you know heimeau

---------04:13----------
and you can always you can see over here

---------04:15----------
with a little little way that you weigh

---------04:16----------
the stuff from the trackpad the keyboard

---------04:17----------
comes in before I even bother to check

---------04:20----------
the USB MUX in the USB hub before

---------04:21----------
actually bother to use my brain which is

---------04:23----------
what I'm always telling you to do look

---------04:24----------
what I did look at this I look

---------04:27----------
they I replaced a chip that's

---------04:28----------
it's between the usb up in the trackpad

---------04:30----------
idiocy complete idiocy I didn't like all

---------04:34----------
you had to do is look over and say hey

---------04:36----------
does this have bluetooth oh no it

---------04:38----------
doesn't have bluetooth oh maybe you have

---------04:40----------
a problem with your USB mocks area oh

---------04:42----------
look at that there's a resistor that's

---------04:44----------
supposed to be there that's not there

---------04:45----------
maybe we should look into that

---------04:47----------
like just common sense that I

---------04:50----------
just Oh

---------04:54----------
I'm disgusted up myself sometimes oh

---------05:05----------
that is one crooked little resistor it's

---------05:10----------
about as crooked as the inside of my

---------05:13----------
lungs are right now yeah it's going to

---------05:20----------
stay that way probably

---------05:29----------
hey are we kidding that's going to stay

---------05:31----------
exactly as it is

---------05:46----------
okay now we go over to the test setup

---------05:50----------
I'm tired of coughing so before the

---------05:55----------
keyboard didn't work at all so let's

---------05:58----------
yeah I'll plug the original SSD and I

---------06:03----------
hate airs for this nonsense so I'm not

---------06:05----------
using the trackpad in the keyboard that

---------06:07----------
are in they have to take the entire

---------06:08----------
thing out to test this kind of stuff

---------06:09----------
because the you know the flex cable from

---------06:12----------
the trackpad goes to here and then the

---------06:16----------
keyboard is to plug into the trackpad

---------06:18----------
but today I can't plug in like this it

---------06:20----------
has to plug in like this install all

---------06:24----------
 oh and then the screen as a

---------06:29----------
cable that's this long before it goes

---------06:31----------
into the LCD and you can't test with the

---------06:34----------
LCD by itself because it's not a

---------06:36----------
complete part so you gotta know this is

---------06:40----------
not a nice machine a test outside it

---------06:42----------
really wastes real estate the real

---------06:43----------
estate and it's a real pain in the ass

---------06:45----------
ah I'll forget about it

---------06:55----------
veneer I'll get it

---------07:00----------
one once I'm done forgetting about it

---------07:02----------
you missed the our BIOS on the USB MUX

---------07:05----------
how could you miss the our bias in the

---------07:06----------
USB MUX just remind me on Monday I'll

---------07:14----------
forget I won't forget steps as you

---------07:23----------
me when I hit the option key I can

---------07:25----------
choose which drive I want to boot from

---------07:26----------
and I can also at camps lock on the

---------07:29----------
keyboard and you can see that little

---------07:30----------
green lights lighting up and going away

---------07:31----------
which means that I fixed the problem

---------07:32----------
it was our bias in the USB MUX da

---------07:37----------
oh man I'm an idiot sometimes
