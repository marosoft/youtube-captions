---------00:04----------
here we have a macbook air

---------00:05----------
that has liquid damage that's not

---------00:06----------
powering on let's figure out what's

---------00:08----------
wrong with this macbook

---------00:09----------
and where the liquid got to that's

---------00:11----------
causing it to not power on and work

---------00:12----------
properly

---------00:13----------
first thing we're going to do is we're

---------00:14----------
going to take the screws out of the

---------00:15----------
bottom of the case memory

---------00:18----------
all alone in the moonlight

---------00:21----------
i can dream of the old days

---------00:24----------
i was beautiful then

---------00:27----------
i remember the time i knew what

---------00:31----------
happiness was

---------00:34----------
let the memory live again

---------00:41----------
every street lamp seems to

---------00:44----------
beat a fatalistic

---------00:47----------
warning someone mutters and the street

---------00:52----------
lamp gutters

---------00:54----------
and soon it will be morning

---------00:59----------
daylight i must wait for the sunrise

---------01:04----------
i must think of a new life and i mustn't

---------01:07----------
give in

---------01:09----------
when the dawn comes tonight will be

---------01:13----------
a memory too and a new

---------01:16----------
day will begin

---------01:28----------
[Music]

---------01:31----------
burned out ends of smokey days

---------01:36----------
the stale cold smell of morning

---------01:40----------
a street lamb dies another night

---------01:44----------
is over another

---------01:47----------
day is dawning

---------01:50----------
touch me it's so easy to leave

---------01:54----------
me all alone with the memory

---------01:57----------
of my days in the sun if you touch

---------02:00----------
me you'll understand what happiness is

---------02:04----------
look a new day has begun

---------02:13----------
my favorite version of that is the one

---------02:14----------
with vl castellan

---------02:16----------
i had such a crush on veal casterlynn

---------02:19----------
she'll probably never find my youtube

---------02:21----------
channel or have a clue who i am

---------02:24----------
but damn vl castelin

---------02:28----------
what an amazing voice just one of those

---------02:30----------
angelic voices

---------02:31----------
people would pay 1 000 tickets to watch

---------02:33----------
lewis on stage fixing macbooks

---------02:36----------
are you serious i sincerely doubt this i

---------02:38----------
would like to have

---------02:40----------
yeah i think high high with ross khan i

---------02:42----------
think that could be a good idea it's

---------02:43----------
just i'd have to find somebody to

---------02:45----------
help me administer roscon and set it up

---------02:48----------
that's not such um

---------02:49----------
how do i put this uh a [ __ ] trader

---------02:53----------
for that i'm totally clipping that and

---------02:54----------
giving the footage to her i wager she'll

---------02:55----------
be flattered

---------02:56----------
i sincerely doubt it i get a light on

---------02:58----------
the charger

---------03:00----------
and this is almost trying to turn on

---------03:02----------
it's using 40 milliamps and spiking to

---------03:04----------
160.

---------03:05----------
so let's look over this board because

---------03:06----------
this is a quite the

---------03:08----------
this board is quite something

---------03:16----------
can you imagine if vl castellan actually

---------03:19----------
showed up to sing at roscon

---------03:21----------
oh man i could die happy right there

---------03:25----------
or rachel tucker oh if i could get

---------03:28----------
rachel tucker to sing there

---------03:30----------
the best absolute best

---------03:34----------
or ruby lewis but that no

---------03:38----------
what are the chances of getting ruby

---------03:39----------
lewis to show up to roscon 2020

---------03:41----------
[Music]

---------03:44----------
from cirque du soleil am i aiming a

---------03:46----------
little too high

---------03:47----------
am i aiming a little too high to have

---------03:48----------
cirque du soleil singers showing up at

---------03:51----------
my conference

---------03:52----------
probably first thing we do here

---------03:59----------
what is this connector called

---------04:02----------
yeah it's dead that's what you are all

---------04:04----------
right now see how there's a pin missing

---------04:05----------
over here

---------04:06----------
see that pin that's burned

---------04:10----------
now granted this connector doesn't

---------04:11----------
matter for anything it's a jtag

---------04:12----------
connector it's used for diagnostics

---------04:14----------
but what i care about is that that pin

---------04:17----------
being burned is going to tell me

---------04:19----------
where there was any sort of electrical

---------04:21----------
or circuit overload

---------04:22----------
that's what i'm interested in so i'm

---------04:24----------
going to open up the schematic in the

---------04:25----------
boardview for the 820164

---------04:28----------
and check that out pp3v42 okay so pp3v42

---------04:31----------
had some sort of nonsense on it

---------04:33----------
so everything on that line i'm going to

---------04:35----------
expect has been a little bit jumpy

---------04:37----------
and that's likely because liquid got on

---------04:39----------
my regulator which means that the 16

---------04:40----------
volts coming into there

---------04:42----------
was likely sent to everything on that

---------04:44----------
line great

---------04:45----------
that's that's just great that's going to

---------04:46----------
make me very happy now

---------04:48----------
it is still putting out pp342 do keep in

---------04:50----------
mind that we did get a green light in

---------04:52----------
the charger we wouldn't be getting a

---------04:53----------
green light in the charger like we did

---------04:54----------
in the beginning if the one wire circle

---------04:55----------
wasn't working the one wire circuit

---------04:56----------
is going to require 5342 to be present

---------04:58----------
so that the

---------04:59----------
two logic gates as well as the smc can

---------05:02----------
be powered which they're not powered

---------05:03----------
pp342 is missing

---------05:05----------
yes chances of ruby lewis showing up at

---------05:07----------
roscon

---------05:09----------
negative 50. i'm not i wouldn't even put

---------05:11----------
one percent on that i would put a

---------05:13----------
negative percent on that

---------05:16----------
she would say no to that before she even

---------05:18----------
knew it existed what if she showed up

---------05:19----------
and sang a song about wanting an iphone

---------05:21----------
4 where is my iphone 4

---------05:23----------
i want an iphone 4. get the [ __ ] out of

---------05:26----------
my store

---------05:27----------
we are closed it's you

---------05:31----------
you're so amazing

---------05:35----------
that's the other thing is that the

---------05:36----------
million subscriber thing is not going to

---------05:38----------
happen anytime soon uh youtube algorithm

---------05:40----------
started doing that thing where it takes

---------05:42----------
me out of people's speed

---------05:44----------
as you know something's going wrong what

---------05:46----------
the f

---------05:47----------
fizzly [ __ ] is that

---------05:52----------
holy moly what did you

---------05:55----------
do dumb dumb

---------06:04----------
i wonder if this is why i'm boot looping

---------06:10----------
oh cd 3211 that's so cute

---------06:13----------
that's before they use cd3215s

---------06:18----------
thunderbolt moxing chips from yesteryear

---------06:22----------
adorable it's adorable

---------06:28----------
someone says gotta push those mainstream

---------06:30----------
media channels on youtube yeah

---------06:33----------
because i've noticed recently i you know

---------06:34----------
i noticed that my view count

---------06:36----------
uh had went down considerably but it

---------06:39----------
also happened at the exact

---------06:40----------
which i don't care you know my my

---------06:41----------
viewpoint my view count is going to go

---------06:43----------
down because my content is [ __ ]

---------06:44----------
boring

---------06:45----------
but what i noticed is that the view

---------06:47----------
count was going down at the exact same

---------06:49----------
time that a bunch of people were saying

---------06:51----------
hey louis i just noticed that i'm not

---------06:53----------
getting notifications when you release a

---------06:54----------
new video anymore hey louis you're not

---------06:56----------
showing up in my subscriber feed

---------06:58----------
like expect me to put time and effort

---------06:59----------
into this effing platform i damn near

---------07:02----------
rather learn to code

---------07:08----------
i damn near rather learn to code so

---------07:11----------
let's see what's going on around here we

---------07:12----------
have these

---------07:13----------
bios traces that are uh

---------07:17----------
so these are traces between the spi rom

---------07:19----------
and the cpu and there's going to be

---------07:20----------
resistors in between

---------07:22----------
just want to make sure that none of

---------07:24----------
these

---------07:25----------
are missing there's a lot of dirt over

---------07:28----------
here so you got to scrape through a lot

---------07:30----------
of junk to see if those resistors are

---------07:31----------
any good

---------07:32----------
also got some corrosion over here and

---------07:34----------
the resistors underneath the cpu

---------07:45----------
memory alone in the moonlight

---------07:56----------
memory

---------07:59----------
i think i'm tired of this board

---------08:02----------
it looks like a piece of [ __ ]

---------08:13----------
burned out ends of smokey

---------08:17----------
cpus the stale cold smell

---------08:22----------
of failing pm sleep

---------08:25----------
s4 l dies another repair

---------08:29----------
is over another

---------08:32----------
touch bar is darning

---------08:44----------
pp5 es4 is missing pp5 es5 is present

---------08:47----------
same old [ __ ] so it's going to be our

---------08:50----------
bios traces most effectively because

---------08:51----------
that's going to keep pm sleep s4

---------08:53----------
functioning and look at these resistors

---------08:55----------
like what what the hell is this these

---------08:56----------
are all called

---------08:57----------
junk so let's see if any let's see which

---------08:59----------
one of these doesn't resist anymore

---------09:03----------
15 ohms you resist

---------09:09----------
this resistor hashtag resists

---------09:15----------
this resistor hashtag resists

---------09:18----------
this resistor hashtag resists

---------09:24----------
this resistor hashtag resists

---------09:28----------
this resistor resists

---------09:32----------
this resistor resists

---------09:35----------
this resistor hashtag resists know what

---------09:38----------
i think now's a great time to head home

---------09:41----------
eat some apples and cinnamon oatmeal

---------09:43----------
play with my cat

---------09:45----------
be done with this [ __ ]

---------09:50----------
sorry folks it's time for me to rage

---------09:52----------
quit it's been fun having you here

---------09:55----------
i'll see y'all in the next video thank

---------09:57----------
you very much for watching and as always

---------09:59----------
i hope you learned something

---------10:02----------
have you bought our green uv curable

---------10:04----------
solder mask

---------10:06----------
but you're not sure how to cure it well

---------10:08----------
don't delay

---------10:09----------
today you can buy our magical uv curing

---------10:12----------
pen

---------10:13----------
this uv curing pen allows you to cure

---------10:16----------
any sort of uv solder mask or conformal

---------10:19----------
coating

---------10:20----------
by simply pressing a button this pen

---------10:23----------
batteries not included

---------10:24----------
is sold on store.rostmangroup.com for

---------10:27----------
the low low price

---------10:28----------
of seven dollars and 96 cents you can

---------10:31----------
simply go to the home page

---------10:32----------
scroll down click on this 405 nanometer

---------10:35----------
laser pointer

---------10:36----------
and this little laser pointer will

---------10:38----------
happily cure all of your uv paste these

---------10:40----------
items

---------10:40----------
will be shipped by mikey say hello mikey

---------10:45----------
that's mikey my goal is by the end of

---------10:47----------
the year that every item that i link

---------10:49----------
below that we actually sell it rather

---------10:51----------
than affiliate link to it on amazon

---------10:53----------
because i'd rather be paying people like

---------10:55----------
mikey than paying people like jeff bezos

---------10:57----------
every time you buy one of these pens you

---------10:59----------
support people like mikey me

---------11:01----------
and unfortunately kevin but that's fun

---------11:03----------
of the cost of doing business

---------11:04----------
unfortunately

---------11:05----------
so check out store.rosmangroup.com to

---------11:07----------
get one of these nice little uv pen

---------11:09----------
let's go to work

---------11:10----------
so we're gonna continue with that

---------11:12----------
macbook air that we were working on

---------11:14----------
yesterday this is the macbook air that

---------11:16----------
was not turning on it was giving us 20

---------11:17----------
to 40 milliamps uh boot looping

---------11:19----------
most likely due to some damage in the

---------11:21----------
spi rom area so the first resistor that

---------11:24----------
i'd like to remove

---------11:25----------
is going to be this one in the upper

---------11:26----------
right corner here

---------11:37----------
[Music]

---------11:44----------
okay i took all those resistors off and

---------11:46----------
it was only one of them that i actually

---------11:47----------
needed to take off

---------11:48----------
and as as usual here's the fun part is

---------11:51----------
that the resistor that i took off

---------11:53----------
that needed to be taken off was the last

---------11:55----------
one you see how that worked

---------11:58----------
i took every single one

---------12:13----------
so that was the only one that actually

---------12:15----------
needed to be taken off that's some good

---------12:17----------
luck right there

---------12:24----------
she knows that um

---------12:45----------
[Music]

---------12:47----------
okay that's one resistor it was a bios

---------12:50----------
issue

---------12:50----------
and what's interesting is that last

---------12:52----------
night we actually measured every single

---------12:54----------
one of those resistors and they were

---------12:55----------
fine

---------12:56----------
but the thing is while the resistor is

---------12:58----------
still on the board you can't see the pad

---------12:59----------
under it and this is one of those

---------13:00----------
reasons when people say why don't you

---------13:02----------
just measure everything

---------13:03----------
that measuring everything doesn't matter

---------13:06----------
because you're not going to see

---------13:07----------
every single part that is important to

---------13:10----------
be seen

---------13:11----------
we're working on that

---------13:52----------
10 16

---------14:02----------
all right

---------14:22----------
i thought he was going to punch you in

---------14:23----------
the face

---------14:26----------
he walks in which one of you is kevin

---------14:45----------
let's see if we uh get a fan spin now we

---------14:47----------
would be pretty happy if after all this

---------14:49----------
we get a fan screen well no why

---------14:51----------
so when i hit the web browser yeah

---------15:01----------
[Music]

---------15:07----------
damn it still 40 milliamps

---------15:13----------
how the hell

---------15:16----------
still 40 milliamps gur

---------15:21----------
and we fixed the one with the messed up

---------15:22----------
pad did i miss a resistor perhaps i

---------15:24----------
missed a resistor

---------15:26----------
looks like i did all of them here we

---------15:29----------
have ultrasonic to that airboard that

---------15:30----------
was driving us

---------15:31----------
nuts and i'm going to give it a second

---------15:34----------
look

---------15:35----------
what would you like for lunch escargot

---------15:36----------
filet mignon

---------15:38----------
um is that oreos over there

---------15:41----------
oh is that the back panel to it what

---------15:43----------
would you like for lunch cargo

---------15:45----------
filet mignon get whatever you want the

---------15:47----------
highest tastes for the rest

---------15:49----------
for the rest of the month that question

---------15:51----------
right there that's your way today's last

---------15:52----------
day okay the next two weeks

---------15:54----------
get the nice get whatever you want okay

---------15:56----------
now the fan spins

---------15:58----------
look at that so all it needed was an

---------16:00----------
ultrasonic after all that work and i'll

---------16:02----------
let you look over and see what the board

---------16:03----------
looks like you saw what it looked like

---------16:05----------
in the beginning

---------16:05----------
and now you can see what it looks like

---------16:07----------
in the end after going through a trip

---------16:08----------
from

---------16:09----------
that send your macbook.com

---------16:12----------
don't delay send your macbook to

---------16:15----------
sendyourmacbook.com

---------16:16----------
today well folks

---------16:21----------
you can barely even recognize it

---------16:27----------
beautiful beautiful fan spin and look at

---------16:30----------
that

---------16:31----------
this board has no more jtag connector

---------16:35----------
lovely so that's it for this one and as

---------16:38----------
always i hope you learned something

---------16:55----------
do you have a macbook that needs to be

---------16:56----------
fixed come by our store

---------16:58----------
