---------00:00----------
let's see what's going on with this

---------00:01----------
MacBook what do they do to you MacBook

---------00:03----------
who hurt you so first thing I'm gonna do

---------00:06----------
is plug in the DCN board and then I'm

---------00:10----------
gonna plug in the charger with my USB C

---------00:12----------
amp meter here and once I plug this in

---------00:15----------
we're going to see how many amps it

---------00:18----------
takes cuz that's gonna give me an idea

---------00:19----------
of what's going on with the board it

---------00:21----------
looks like this is taking five point one

---------00:23----------
volts at point one amps hmm so again the

---------00:28----------
same rules are going to apply here that

---------00:29----------
apply with any of the other touch bars I

---------00:32----------
work on then use this as a USB C MUX so

---------00:34----------
the first thing I'm gonna want to do is

---------00:36----------
see if I have pp3 v3 underscore g3 hot

---------00:39----------
so we're gonna see if we have a pp3 v3

---------00:41----------
underscore g3 hot because that is gonna

---------00:43----------
be required for the CD 3215 to work so

---------00:46----------
we are gonna measure on that inductor

---------00:47----------
and see if we get PP 3 V 3 underscore g3

---------00:50----------
hot Ben Horace's I don't like reality as

---------00:52----------
it is so I don't have kids cuz I don't

---------00:53----------
want to be the cause of people

---------00:54----------
experience in the shame [ __ ] is I did

---------00:56----------
see that's the cool part about having

---------00:57----------
children

---------00:57----------
that's why I want to have kids because I

---------00:59----------
want I want to do everything I can to

---------01:01----------
ensure that the my kids grow up the

---------01:04----------
exact opposite of how I did and I think

---------01:07----------
that I have enough knowledge now to

---------01:10----------
ensure that my kids would grow up very

---------01:14----------
differently than I did and that they

---------01:15----------
would have a much better life that's the

---------01:17----------
fun part I think all right so it appears

---------01:19----------
that pp3 v3 underscore g3 hot is not

---------01:22----------
here so that's the problem that we're

---------01:24----------
going to have to solve before we do

---------01:25----------
anything else on this MacBook pp3 v3

---------01:28----------
underscore g3 HUD is not present so the

---------01:30----------
first thing I'm going to do here is I am

---------01:32----------
going to unplug the charger and then

---------01:34----------
measure the resistance to ground we

---------01:39----------
don't have a short to ground we have 12

---------01:41----------
kilo ohms to ground on pp3 v3 underscore

---------01:43----------
g3 hot that's a trap dude kids that have

---------01:45----------
everything to have a great start usually

---------01:47----------
[ __ ] up everything as adults no that's

---------01:48----------
not kids that have a great start that's

---------01:50----------
kids that just have everything I think

---------01:52----------
that's where you're getting it wrong so

---------01:53----------
if you give your kids millions of

---------01:55----------
dollars and no supervision and no

---------01:58----------
guidance that is [ __ ] them up if you

---------02:00----------
give your kid a good start

---------02:02----------
that means that that's different than

---------02:05----------
giving them everything in my opinion but

---------02:07----------
again I'm not I'm not a dad but I'd like

---------02:09----------
to be a dad someday so let's take this

---------02:11----------
board out and try to figure out why pp 3

---------02:13----------
V 3 or underscore

---------02:13----------
jihad is not present on this board so

---------02:16----------
what makes PP 3v3 underscore g3 hot on

---------02:18----------
this board that's gonna be the first

---------02:19----------
thing that we gotta find this is the

---------02:21----------
coil this is pp 3 v3 underscore g3 hot

---------02:24----------
and you are created you are created by

---------02:28----------
you 7000 which doesn't exist

---------02:32----------
yay so this is one of those chips that I

---------02:35----------
VI keep trying to find it and I keep

---------02:37----------
failing to find it you have to take this

---------02:40----------
off of a donor board and reball it and I

---------02:43----------
don't know we know if I have a donor for

---------02:45----------
this thing let's take a look at pet this

---------02:48----------
chip and see what everything looks like

---------02:49----------
in this area yeah so they built that

---------02:52----------
into the ISL 955 3-0 Apple has done a

---------02:56----------
lot of work to make sure that nobody can

---------02:58----------
get their hands on this thing like a lot

---------03:03----------
of work and it paid off because nobody

---------03:07----------
has gotten their hands on this chip I

---------03:08----------
had a few but I could never find them

---------03:11----------
again after that one purchase nothing

---------03:16----------
here looks particularly nasty there's

---------03:19----------
one resistor that looks like it's a

---------03:21----------
little burned up looking but right over

---------03:24----------
here but that's that doesn't seem

---------03:26----------
damaged to me I'm gonna check it just in

---------03:28----------
case let's see what are you for

---------03:30----------
yeah your resistor to ground for a high

---------03:32----------
power enable and you're supposed to be a

---------03:35----------
hundred kilohms and I imagine if I

---------03:36----------
measure that you are gonna be 100 kilo

---------03:38----------
ohms so really sucks that you can't get

---------03:43----------
ISL chips for the newer math books

---------03:45----------
without going through a lot of pain and

---------03:47----------
struggling yeah that's a fine resistor

---------03:50----------
there's nothing wrong with that resistor

---------03:55----------
input is there but input is severely

---------03:57----------
down why interesting so we have 5 volts

---------04:03----------
on input but over here where it's going

---------04:07----------
to this area that is 4.5 so why the drop

---------04:11----------
why the precipitous drop all right

---------04:14----------
that's interesting so let's see where

---------04:17----------
are you coming from this is the circuit

---------04:20----------
for creating pp 3 v 3 underscore g3 huh

---------04:22----------
now I know because switch is attached to

---------04:25----------
the ISL chip

---------04:27----------
over here this charger PM I see I know

---------04:32----------
that since it's attached to this from

---------04:35----------
the board view that I was looking at

---------04:36----------
that this chip is gonna be making it see

---------04:37----------
where it says PP 3v3 underscore g3 hot

---------04:40----------
SW over here that means that you're

---------04:42----------
making it but what I don't understand is

---------04:48----------
what is going on with PP VIN underscore

---------04:52----------
g3 hot underscore p3 v3 underscore g3

---------04:55----------
hot because you're the input but where

---------04:57----------
do you come from what are you there for

---------04:59----------
I mean where do you come from it doesn't

---------05:02----------
really tell me and that sucks

---------05:04----------
are you created by you 7000 is that what

---------05:07----------
we're getting out over here on pin 56

---------05:11----------
either the chip itself is bad or it's

---------05:16----------
not being told to create that rail let's

---------05:20----------
treat this as if it was an old is l6 259

---------05:25----------
so let's check on our 70 10 okay so SMC

---------05:29----------
reset L is stuck at zero point zero six

---------05:32----------
volts that's not a valid state we should

---------05:34----------
be at zero volts or 3.3 volts but I

---------05:37----------
don't understand what the hell's going

---------05:39----------
on with 0.06 volts and do keep in mind

---------05:42----------
this is not with a keyboard or anything

---------05:43----------
plugged in that's gonna be shorting it

---------05:45----------
to ground all we have plugged in is a DC

---------05:46----------
on board so SMC reset L is stuck and we

---------05:50----------
have to figure out what's gonna be

---------05:52----------
making SMC reset l and it seems that

---------05:54----------
that is actually built into the is L six

---------05:57----------
two five nine on this board so this is a

---------06:00----------
great way to tell if I'm correct so you

---------06:03----------
look SMC reset L so they've integrated

---------06:06----------
several things in here so that check

---------06:08----------
this is how they shrunk the fifth

---------06:10----------
this is how they shrunk this machine so

---------06:13----------
the is L six two five nine which create

---------06:15----------
a PP bus G three hot the you sever the

---------06:17----------
die D which created PP three before -

---------06:19----------
and the SMC reset IC have all been

---------06:22----------
integrated into one chip the is L nine

---------06:24----------
five five three zero which would be fine

---------06:26----------
if it wasn't for the fact that I can't

---------06:29----------
get that effing chip now the the real

---------06:32----------
issue here is I can't get a chip that's

---------06:35----------
the real issue here and I can I know

---------06:37----------
that that's what's wrong because SMC

---------06:39----------
reset L is not supposed to be stuck like

---------06:41----------
that

---------06:41----------
that SMC reset L is stuck low so now I

---------06:43----------
know it's got to be that chip it's not

---------06:44----------
something else

---------06:45----------
because nothing else is gonna cause SMC

---------06:47----------
reset l to be low besides that chip and

---------06:49----------
this is the kind of failure mode that I

---------06:50----------
would expect in the older Mac books this

---------06:52----------
is the exact type of failure mode I

---------06:54----------
would expect in the older Mac books when

---------06:55----------
the SMC reset L chip is broken the issue

---------06:57----------
is that I need an is L nine five five

---------06:59----------
three zero four bad odor board oh think

---------07:02----------
I have one so I'm gonna have to try and

---------07:04----------
locate one and all the is all nine five

---------07:06----------
five three zeros I've been finding

---------07:08----------
online are not the right date code and

---------07:10----------
don't work if you find an ISL nine five

---------07:14----------
five three zero that doesn't say this on

---------07:16----------
it it's probably not going to work
