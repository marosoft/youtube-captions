---------00:00----------
hey everybody how's it going so today

---------00:02----------
we're gonna get started working on yet

---------00:03----------
another dead macbook here we have an a

---------00:05----------
1502 is a 1502 appears to be not

---------00:08----------
powering on after some liquid damage

---------00:10----------
let's get started on this MacBook and

---------00:13----------
see if we can make it work again first

---------00:15----------
thing we have to do d corona the desk we

---------00:19----------
do make our desk nicely D Corona de

---------00:24----------
Dycker ona die next thing we do is

---------00:31----------
Dieker on to the macbook our macbook

---------00:34----------
here macbook there here a Mac there a

---------00:39----------
Mac everywhere a Mac Mac die Corona die

---------00:45----------
no Corona in the air no Corona in my

---------00:48----------
chair

---------00:49----------
no Corona here are there no Corona

---------00:51----------
anywhere GTFO corona no virus for me

---------00:59----------
listen to that Teresa and Joe Rogan

---------01:02----------
podcast with the guy forget the guys

---------01:04----------
name I know he has yellow in his name

---------01:05----------
but I listened to that podcast and nope

---------01:08----------
no corona for me screw that I'm not

---------01:12----------
going through that I'm not getting

---------01:13----------
corona from this MacBook die death to

---------01:17----------
this vile virus

---------01:39----------
so as we can see here we're taking 200

---------01:42----------
milliamps at 18 point 5 volts however

---------01:46----------
we're not getting a fan spin and this is

---------01:48----------
a model wort I would expect to see the

---------01:50----------
fan spin and the fan is not spinning so

---------01:55----------
let's just do our preliminary tests and

---------01:57----------
unplug some things that could cause the

---------01:59----------
fan to not spin like the keyboard or the

---------02:02----------
trackpad

---------02:17----------
and still nothing there so now we're

---------02:19----------
gonna unplug the i/o boarding see if

---------02:21----------
that does anything remember before you

---------02:22----------
say that you have a board problem you

---------02:24----------
gotta make sure you don't have a parts

---------02:25----------
problem when we unplug the i/o board

---------02:32----------
we're still topping out at around 200

---------02:34----------
milliamps which means that we almost

---------02:36----------
certainly have a board problem you can

---------02:41----------
plug this yeah this is gonna be a board

---------02:48----------
problem now what is it that causes 174

---------02:50----------
milliamp a little bit of jumping up and

---------02:52----------
down on an 8 - 0 - 30 476 a 1502 2013-14

---------03:00----------
MacBook Pro board does anybody know

---------03:02----------
could be a massive short but I don't

---------03:04----------
think so I don't think it's a massive

---------03:05----------
short and the reason I don't think so is

---------03:07----------
because it's going up and down a massive

---------03:08----------
short would be taking a specific set

---------03:10----------
amount of amperage not going up and down

---------03:17----------
okay

---------03:20----------
now I think I found it actually yeah

---------03:23----------
watch this I bet it's a P P 5 ESO short

---------03:26----------
through the keyboard can a backlight

---------03:28----------
connector but I'll let you be the judge

---------03:30----------
and tell me yes put my microscope light

---------03:34----------
back on because I took the damn thing

---------03:36----------
off so that I could finish up my

---------03:38----------
microscope camera review video I did a

---------03:42----------
second comparison with HDR anyway let's

---------03:52----------
get this board out of the case I

---------03:54----------
actually I could tell my voices kind of

---------03:57----------
went down a little actually got sad just

---------03:58----------
thinking about that whole [ __ ] that I

---------04:00----------
was reading

---------04:13----------
okay on to this so the first thing that

---------04:18----------
I saw immediately is this you take a

---------04:22----------
look at this you'll see first thing

---------04:25----------
breathes a little heavier

---------04:27----------
please the mic isn't picking it up only

---------04:29----------
fans member you know what just for you

---------04:32----------
just for you you [ __ ] how about this

---------04:35----------
anyway back to this so one of the first

---------04:40----------
things it's pretty obvious there is that

---------04:42----------
the keyboard backlight connector is

---------04:44----------
destroyed and take a look at that with

---------04:46----------
my brand new handy-dandy microscope

---------04:50----------
light yeah I know it whoops

---------05:01----------
isn't it pretty you're breathing sounded

---------05:11----------
very moist subscribing yes

---------05:14----------
I've gained a subscriber how does it

---------05:22----------
look what do you think one HDR no HDR

---------05:24----------
what do you guys think like no HDR but

---------05:27----------
more exposure or more HDR and less

---------05:31----------
exposure I don't know I kind of HDR kind

---------05:33----------
of [ __ ] with everything I'm personally

---------05:35----------
I'm personally not a big fan of the HDR

---------05:38----------
unless I'm zooming in I'm gonna keep HDR

---------05:40----------
off anyway so this is the keyboard back

---------05:43----------
light connector now pp5 ESO is what's

---------05:45----------
gonna power the keyboard backlight now

---------05:46----------
what's really interesting about the

---------05:47----------
MacBook is that if you have a problem

---------05:49----------
with the screen backlight the machine

---------05:50----------
will still turn on on older models it

---------05:53----------
blows the fuse on a newer model this is

---------05:55----------
a current sensing circuit and the

---------05:56----------
current sensing circuit is gonna tell if

---------05:57----------
the MacBook is backlight if the screen

---------06:00----------
backlight is taking too much power it's

---------06:03----------
just not going to turn on the backlight

---------06:05----------
but it'll turn on the rest of the

---------06:06----------
computer so you can plug it into an

---------06:08----------
external monitor you can have a

---------06:09----------
flashlight going through the back with

---------06:11----------
the keyboard backlight which is powered

---------06:13----------
by the same chip if there's a short it

---------06:16----------
just kills the computer Wow watch I'm

---------06:20----------
gonna demonstrate right now how well

---------06:22----------
this machine is engineered so I'm gonna

---------06:24----------
do just gonna remove this keyboard

---------06:27----------
backlight connector

---------06:34----------
just like this little bit of flux a

---------06:38----------
little bit of hot air

---------06:48----------
yeah I agree with you the HDR is

---------06:50----------
something I'm only going to use when I

---------06:51----------
do lots of zoom but it's better to have

---------06:54----------
a more powerful light unless HDR so

---------06:56----------
watch we just removes it like that

---------07:02----------
focus

---------07:05----------
focus focus

---------07:12----------
and what's really cool here is that the

---------07:14----------
pads are not removed because on the

---------07:16----------
other occasions where I've had to remove

---------07:18----------
this connector the pads have been

---------07:20----------
completely destroyed and here the pads

---------07:22----------
are now completely destroyed which i

---------07:24----------
think is great

---------07:45----------
so I obviously don't need about keyboard

---------07:47----------
backlight to be there for it to turn on

---------07:50----------
so I'm gonna try and see if I get fan

---------07:53----------
spin now that the keyboard backlight

---------07:55----------
connector that looks destroyed it's been

---------07:56----------
removed and I'm and I am gonna get it I

---------07:59----------
am gonna get it you'll see so this is my

---------08:02----------
board right here it's gonna have the

---------08:05----------
power supply on Apple thinks keyboard

---------08:07----------
backlight is essential but screen

---------08:10----------
backlight is it think different

---------08:13----------
something like that

---------08:15----------
alright so we're gonna plug it in it's

---------08:17----------
taken six hundred milliamps which means

---------08:19----------
we're gonna see a fan spin and bam now

---------08:21----------
the reason that I find it really funny

---------08:23----------
that the screen backlight won't kill the

---------08:26----------
machine but keyboard backlight will is

---------08:27----------
because it's the same circuit so you'd

---------08:29----------
think if you had the same chip

---------08:31----------
controlling them and he had about the

---------08:32----------
same circuit that you'd get the same

---------08:34----------
result from a short on each one but as

---------08:38----------
I'll show you you don't so let's just

---------08:40----------
open up a schematic here to the eight to

---------08:41----------
zero 34 seventy six actually all I have

---------08:46----------
is a schematic to the eight to zero is

---------08:47----------
35 36 which is pretty much the same

---------08:48----------
thing just go over here we're gonna go

---------08:53----------
over to the backlight circuit that's

---------08:57----------
gonna be up here around you 7700 now and

---------09:02----------
you go to you 7700 what you'll see is

---------09:05----------
that this page has every has both the

---------09:16----------
backlight output to the screen over here

---------09:18----------
and the backlight output to the keyboard

---------09:21----------
over here the same chip is controlling

---------09:23----------
both so if this if it's gonna tell if

---------09:26----------
there's a short over here and turn it

---------09:27----------
off

---------09:27----------
why can't you set it to see if there's a

---------09:29----------
short over here and turn backlight off

---------09:31----------
as well rather than just shorting pp5

---------09:33----------
ESO to ground and killing the entire

---------09:35----------
computer think different baby yeah let's

---------09:40----------
put a new connector on there

---------09:41----------
obviously this customer's gonna need a

---------09:43----------
new keyboard backlight cuz that keyboard

---------09:44----------
backlight is done for it's not gonna

---------09:46----------
work for it properly anymore

---------09:48----------
let me get myself a q-tip I'm gonna need

---------09:52----------
some q-tips

---------09:55----------
HDR is good to an extent if I'm fully

---------09:58----------
zoomed in I have no problem using HDR

---------10:00----------
once I've run out of exposure donald's

---------10:02----------
but it's using HDR and the beginning is

---------10:05----------
no need for them

---------10:21----------
we have Tim in the chair

---------10:24----------
Tim how's everything how you doing how's

---------10:27----------
everything going

---------10:38----------
Thank You grant good morning from Oz he

---------10:42----------
said

---------10:46----------
is that one of those strange places

---------10:48----------
where underground where they have

---------10:52----------
crocodiles and alligators and dingos and

---------10:56----------
Paul Daniels's oh there are a lot on top

---------11:00----------
of the other oh oh you can see your

---------11:04----------
content keep up the good work

---------11:05----------
why thank you

---------11:19----------
okay now we find another connector and I

---------11:23----------
think I could hit hot air that thing in

---------11:24----------
I'm gonna try this hot airing it on

---------11:27----------
there cuz I gotta find a board that has

---------11:31----------
that damn connector still go fella

---------11:38----------
get some good old crotch cam oh yeah

---------11:42----------
crotch cam

---------11:52----------
all right

---------11:56----------
let's get this guy now the fume

---------11:58----------
extractor over here take my hot air

---------12:01----------
station I'm gonna remove my nozzle from

---------12:03----------
the hot air

---------13:03----------
Thank You Matsui

---------13:26----------
I heat from the bottom of the board

---------13:28----------
because I don't want to I don't want to

---------13:31----------
ruin the connector

---------14:04----------
see how that just kind of fell on the

---------14:06----------
place it's beautiful I have the nozzle

---------14:11----------
off of it so I'm not directing a bunch

---------14:13----------
of air into one tiny place rather I'm

---------14:15----------
kind of heating the board as a whole

---------14:17----------
[Music]

---------14:31----------
that's a much easier way to get that

---------14:33----------
connector on there and that's about it

---------14:38----------
so that's a working MacBook and I find

---------14:42----------
it really interesting that on this model

---------14:44----------
if the display backlight is shorted to

---------14:47----------
ground it will just stop the display

---------14:49----------
backlight from turning on and the

---------14:51----------
computer will work but if the keyboard

---------14:53----------
backlight is shorted to ground which is

---------14:55----------
part of the same circuit powered by the

---------14:56----------
same chip the entire machine dies

---------14:59----------
quality engineering Apple that's it for

---------15:02----------
today and as always I hope you learned

---------15:03----------
something thank you so much for watching

---------15:05----------
I'll see you all in the next video bye

---------15:07----------
now
