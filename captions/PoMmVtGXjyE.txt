---------00:00----------
be a good little didn't check the

---------00:01----------
stability of my overclock before doing

---------00:03----------
mission-critical recording computer good

---------00:06----------
computer so today we're gonna be looking

---------00:08----------
at an EI 1466 MacBook the owner claims

---------00:12----------
that this MacBook is not powering on so

---------00:14----------
let's figure out why it's not powering

---------00:16----------
on I have a feeling that it may have

---------00:18----------
something to do with liquid damage the

---------00:19----------
reason I think it's liquid is because

---------00:21----------
they said they got no liquid inside of

---------00:23----------
it which is a great way to know that

---------00:24----------
they probably got liquid inside of it so

---------00:26----------
let's see what happens

---------00:27----------
I'm gonna take my charger plug it in see

---------00:30----------
how many amps it uses now you look it

---------00:34----------
appears that the fan is actually

---------00:36----------
spinning however the light is not

---------00:39----------
turning on the charger that's not a good

---------00:41----------
thing we need to light to turn on on the

---------00:42----------
charger and we don't have a light in the

---------00:44----------
charger and let's see if paul daniels of

---------00:46----------
software can handle me opening a PDF

---------00:48----------
with it I put that PDF in your face now

---------00:51----------
what's Paul Daniel software gonna do

---------00:53----------
with it why do I have that stupid song

---------00:55----------
stuck in my head

---------00:55----------
this is someone dumbass rapper that did

---------00:57----------
that and like he has he had this really

---------01:00----------
dumb tattoo

---------01:01----------
oh my kidding look that narrows it down

---------01:02----------
I have the worst crap stuck in my head

---------01:05----------
stitches yeah I feel bad for you because

---------01:07----------
you have that stuck in your head too so

---------01:08----------
this is where the charger is gonna be

---------01:10----------
allowed to talk to the SMC now the line

---------01:12----------
that goes to the charger is this sis one

---------01:14----------
wire line and remember this is different

---------01:16----------
from the older machines in that all that

---------01:19----------
one wire circuitry is on the piece the

---------01:21----------
end board which I don't have a schematic

---------01:22----------
for but from older schematics we know

---------01:24----------
that sis one wire is the line that's

---------01:25----------
gonna want to talk to the SMC and the

---------01:27----------
chips that allow the Chargers data line

---------01:30----------
to talk to the SMC on this one wire line

---------01:32----------
are powered by pp 3 V 4 2 and turned on

---------01:37----------
by SM CBC AC okay let's see what it

---------01:40----------
looks like under this connector I put

---------01:42----------
that DC and board in your face now what

---------01:46----------
are you gonna do god dammit know that

---------01:49----------
music sucks I put this broken logic

---------01:52----------
board in your face now what you're gonna

---------01:54----------
do with it so we've got some corroded

---------01:57----------
pins over here what are those pins for

---------01:59----------
that's a great question let's consult

---------02:00----------
Paul Daniels's board view software

---------02:02----------
sis why are P P 3 V 4 2 & something for

---------02:05----------
USB USB 1 yeah do you really need USB is

---------02:09----------
that really that necessary mean you got

---------02:11----------
one port on the other side of the

---------02:12----------
computer why do you need a port on this

---------02:13----------
side

---------02:13----------
the computer what kind of greedy prick

---------02:15----------
are you if you were buying a new 12-inch

---------02:17----------
MacBook for the same price that you

---------02:19----------
would have bought paid for this MacBook

---------02:20----------
Air just a few years ago

---------02:21----------
you get one port not two so why should I

---------02:23----------
give you two ports back why should I put

---------02:25----------
extra work in when I can actually

---------02:27----------
upgrade this to a more modern MacBook by

---------02:30----------
leaving the left port out I think I'm

---------02:31----------
gonna just focus on the charger I'm

---------02:33----------
trying to come Apple Authorized I want

---------02:35----------
to follow Apple's aesthetic here so do

---------02:36----------
you really need a port on this side of

---------02:38----------
the computer and this side of the

---------02:40----------
computer that's a bit too much for me so

---------02:42----------
what we're gonna do just take the SSD

---------02:44----------
out so that I could fit a soldering iron

---------02:45----------
in that little space where you're going

---------02:46----------
to touch up those pads and see if we can

---------02:49----------
get the charge of the light to be

---------02:50----------
working again now for this I'm not gonna

---------02:53----------
use the standard hako iron that I

---------02:54----------
usually use I'm going to use the hakko

---------02:56----------
FM 2032 micro pencil let's see if we can

---------03:00----------
make this look beautiful again so a

---------03:03----------
little the first thing I'm gonna do is

---------03:05----------
scrape away at any of this nastiness

---------03:08----------
over here alright as you can see most of

---------03:12----------
the nastiness actually goes away without

---------03:14----------
a fight

---------03:14----------
and when you move away the nastiness

---------03:16----------
you'll see that it's not three pads that

---------03:18----------
are broken it's actually just this one

---------03:20----------
see because if I touch this one it

---------03:23----------
doesn't move and that's the test by the

---------03:25----------
way for all you who are wondering after

---------03:26----------
you solder a connector like this you

---------03:28----------
should take a set of tweezers and go

---------03:29----------
through each pad each pin and see if

---------03:33----------
they move when you put pressure on them

---------03:35----------
and if they move like this one you know

---------03:37----------
it's no good but GPU to using your

---------03:39----------
streaming PC are 390 I think it's an

---------03:42----------
online 390 clean it up some alcohol and

---------03:48----------
a q-tip

---------04:09----------
now I'm scraping and here this is the

---------04:13----------
opposite of what Jesse Jones says so

---------04:15----------
Jesse Jones says scraping is raping by

---------04:18----------
the way for all of you who said that

---------04:19----------
that the thumbnail of my video is

---------04:20----------
misogynistic where I said scraping is

---------04:22----------
raping that was Jesse Jones's

---------04:24----------
catchphrase which I took from her a

---------04:27----------
mother of two young daughters and Mendon

---------04:32----------
anyway this I'm gonna scrape and the

---------04:36----------
reason I'm scraping is because I want to

---------04:37----------
remove the layer from the board that is

---------04:40----------
I want to remove that conformal layer

---------04:41----------
from the board but I also want to remove

---------04:43----------
any of the junky corroded nonsense that

---------04:47----------
may be left behind that is gonna be on

---------04:49----------
top of my copper layer so that when I

---------04:52----------
saw it with a pin on I get a nice

---------04:55----------
connection

---------05:19----------
yeah okay we tap it up against the pin

---------05:22----------
move it away

---------05:24----------
make sure it's soldered nicely on the

---------05:26----------
board rip off the excess and now we see

---------05:32----------
if this worked so the first thing I'm

---------05:33----------
gonna need to do is replace that DC and

---------05:35----------
board cable as well because if you look

---------05:37----------
not only was the connection on the board

---------05:39----------
broken the cable itself looks corroded

---------05:41----------
and missing pins so for example this one

---------05:44----------
this one this one this one so I'm gonna

---------05:47----------
go and get a replacement cable so let's

---------05:49----------
see if this works with a new DC and

---------05:50----------
cable and there we have it as you can

---------05:55----------
see not only do we get a fan spin but we

---------05:58----------
get a light on the charger focus focus

---------06:04----------
you bastard

---------06:10----------
[Music]

---------06:14----------
all right no focus well you get the idea

---------06:16----------
it works even if I have no clue how to

---------06:21----------
use my damn camera so that's it for that

---------06:23----------
you have a nice working MacBook Air and

---------06:25----------
the line that we were able to restore

---------06:27----------
here if we take a look on the schematic

---------06:29----------
in the board view appears to be the P P

---------06:31----------
3 V 4 2 line that's the one that I would

---------06:33----------
expect to blow because that's the power

---------06:34----------
line I don't expect the data line to be

---------06:36----------
the one that's gonna corrode in the case

---------06:38----------
of liquid I expect it to be that the

---------06:39----------
power line is the one that's gonna

---------06:40----------
corrode in the case of liquid and that's

---------06:42----------
what appears to have happened

---------06:48----------
and if you're interested in where you

---------06:50----------
could find stuff like this all the

---------06:51----------
equipment that I recommend that you

---------06:52----------
purchase for yourself is actually

---------06:55----------
equipment that I list well stored our

---------06:58----------
Osmond group comm so if you go to store

---------07:00----------
doubt rossmann group comm and you're

---------07:01----------
curious about the type of irons that I

---------07:02----------
use you can go to soldering stations

---------07:04----------
soldering irons and you'll see a list of

---------07:06----------
the soldering irons that I use and

---------07:08----------
recommend including the micro pencil now

---------07:10----------
wait it may say out of stock but wait

---------07:12----------
there's more

---------07:13----------
you can click on the link and it'll

---------07:15----------
bring you to my Amazon affiliate link

---------07:17----------
where you can actually buy it on Amazon

---------07:19----------
itself don't delay buy today and as you

---------07:23----------
can see the vendor on Amazon realized

---------07:25----------
that I was linking to them and as a

---------07:26----------
result raise the price cuz they're a

---------07:29----------
prick but yeah this this seems to happen

---------07:31----------
a literally everything that I recommend

---------07:33----------
people buy on Amazon now everything that

---------07:35----------
I have affiliate link to on Amazon they

---------07:37----------
 jack the price up up and this

---------07:38----------
has been pissing me off recently since I

---------07:40----------
had to buy the tips recently so for

---------07:43----------
example I use the T 30 - KN and see this

---------07:45----------
used to be 40 dollars and seven cents

---------07:47----------
how much you want to bet it's like fifty

---------07:49----------
bucks now when I go to Amazon to buy the

---------07:50----------
stick so we're gonna click here I go to

---------07:52----------
buy the tip and like you you cooks up

---------07:54----------
you mother look at it 49.95 King pieceof

---------08:04----------
if you need a new DC and board cable you

---------08:07----------
can find DC and board cables at store

---------08:09----------
osmond group comm if you go over to

---------08:11----------
store dot Rossmann group comm you can

---------08:13----------
search for macbook parts by type DC and

---------08:17----------
board DC and board cable and the first

---------08:19----------
one available is a DC and board cable

---------08:21----------
available for the low low price of $5.99

---------08:24----------
it'll even detail the model MacBooks

---------08:27----------
that it works in and it has a nice high

---------08:29----------
resolution picture than you can you draw

---------08:31----------
from don't delay

---------08:32----------
buy today
